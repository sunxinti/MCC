**1. Question Analysis**
- The question is assessing knowledge of genetic susceptibility factors associated with polygenic (late-onset) Alzheimer's disease. It requires identifying which gene among the listed options is implicated in increasing the risk for developing this multifactorial form of Alzheimer's disease, which involves multiple genetic and environmental factors.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**
- **Polygenic vs. Monogenic Disorders**: Polygenic disorders involve multiple genes contributing to disease risk, often interacting with environmental factors. In contrast, monogenic disorders are caused by mutations in a single gene.
- **Alzheimer's Disease Genetics**:
  - **Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease (EOAD)**: Typically monogenic, associated with mutations in genes such as APP (Amyloid precursor protein), PS1 (Presenilin 1), and PS2 (Presenilin 2). These mutations lead to abnormal protein processing and accumulation.
  - **Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD)**: Polygenic, with multiple genes contributing to susceptibility. The APOE (Apolipoprotein E) gene, particularly the ε4 allele, is the most significant genetic risk factor for LOAD, influencing amyloid-beta deposition and other pathological processes.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **APP (Amyloid Precursor Protein)**
   - **Role**: Mutations in APP are linked to familial, early-onset Alzheimer's disease.
   - **Relevance to Polygenic AD**: Not associated with polygenic Alzheimer's; pertains to monogenic forms.
   - **Conclusion**: Incorrect.

2. **PS1 (Presenilin 1)**
   - **Role**: Mutations in PS1 are associated with familial, early-onset Alzheimer's disease.
   - **Relevance to Polygenic AD**: Not related to polygenic forms; involved in monogenic inheritance.
   - **Conclusion**: Incorrect.

3. **PS2 (Presenilin 2)**
   - **Role**: Similar to PS1, mutations in PS2 are linked to familial, early-onset Alzheimer's disease.
   - **Relevance to Polygenic AD**: Does not convey susceptibility to polygenic forms.
   - **Conclusion**: Incorrect.

4. **APOE (Apolipoprotein E)**
   - **Role**: The APOE gene, especially the ε4 allele, is a significant risk factor for late-onset (polygenic) Alzheimer's disease.
   - **Relevance to Polygenic AD**: Directly associated with increased susceptibility to polygenic forms through mechanisms affecting amyloid-beta metabolism and neuronal repair.
   - **Conclusion**: Correct.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks which gene contributes to susceptibility for **polygenic Alzheimer disease**.  
- Key concepts:  
  - Polygenic inheritance (multiple genes with small effects).  
  - Alzheimer disease subtypes (early-onset vs. late-onset).  
  - Distinguishing between **causative mutations** (monogenic forms) and **risk alleles** (polygenic contributions).  

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Polygenic Alzheimer disease**: Refers to late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD), which is influenced by multiple genetic variants (e.g., APOE, SORL1, Clusterin) and environmental factors.  
- **Monogenic Alzheimer disease**: Caused by pathogenic mutations in single genes (APP, PS1, PS2), leading to early-onset familial Alzheimer’s (EOFAD), typically autosomal dominant.  
- **APOE**: The **APOE ε4 allele** is the strongest genetic risk factor for LOAD. It does not cause the disease alone but increases susceptibility.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: APP**  
  - Encodes amyloid precursor protein. Mutations in APP cause **early-onset familial Alzheimer’s** (monogenic, autosomal dominant).  
  - **Incorrect** for polygenic susceptibility.  

- **Option 2: PS1**  
  - Presenilin 1 gene. Pathogenic mutations in PS1 cause **EOFAD** (monogenic, autosomal dominant).  
  - **Incorrect** for polygenic susceptibility.  

- **Option 3: PS2**  
  - Presenilin 2 gene. Similarly to PS1, pathogenic mutations here cause **EOFAD** (monogenic).  
  - **Incorrect** for polygenic susceptibility.  

- **Option 4: APOE**  
  - The **APOE ε4 allele** is a major genetic risk factor for **late-onset Alzheimer’s** (polygenic).  
  - Carriers of ε4 have increased risk, but it is not causative alone.  
  - **Correct** for polygenic susceptibility.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks which gene is associated with increased susceptibility to **polygenic Alzheimer disease**, specifically distinguishing it from monogenic forms. Polygenic inheritance implies multiple genetic variants contributing to disease risk, typically in late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD).  

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Monogenic Alzheimer disease** (early-onset, familial) is caused by highly penetrant autosomal dominant mutations in *APP*, *PS1* (presenilin 1), or *PS2* (presenilin 2). These mutations directly disrupt amyloid-beta processing.  
- **Polygenic Alzheimer disease** (late-onset, sporadic) involves susceptibility genes with smaller individual effects. *APOE* (apolipoprotein E) is the strongest genetic risk factor for LOAD, particularly the ε4 allele. APOE influences lipid metabolism, amyloid aggregation, and neuronal repair.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: APP**  
  - *APP* mutations cause early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease, not polygenic susceptibility. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 2: PS1**  
  - *PS1* mutations are linked to early-onset familial Alzheimer disease. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 3: PS2**  
  - *PS2* mutations are rare but also associated with early-onset monogenic Alzheimer disease. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 4: APOE**  
  - *APOE* ε4 is a major susceptibility allele for polygenic LOAD, increasing risk in a dose-dependent manner. **Correct**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  
- *APOE* is the only gene listed that contributes to polygenic susceptibility for late-onset Alzheimer disease, aligning with its role as a risk-modifying allele rather than a causative mutation. The other options are linked to monogenic, early-onset forms.
