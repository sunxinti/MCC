**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is focusing on identifying a characteristic feature of **X-linked dominant inheritance** among the provided options. It requires distinguishing features that are unique or prominent in X-linked dominant patterns compared to other inheritance modes.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **X-linked dominant inheritance** involves genes located on the X chromosome where only one copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to express the trait or disorder.
- In this pattern:
  - **Both males and females can be affected**, but males often exhibit more severe symptoms due to having only one X chromosome.
  - **Affected males transmit the disorder to all their daughters** (since daughters inherit their father’s only X chromosome) but to none of their sons (who inherit the Y chromosome).
  - **Affected females have a 50% chance** of passing the disorder to each child, regardless of sex.
- Unlike autosomal patterns, X-linked dominant inheritance does not require parental consanguinity, and male-to-male transmission is impossible because males pass their Y chromosome to sons.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Parental consanguinity**
   - *Incorrect.* Parental consanguinity refers to parents being related, which is more relevant to autosomal recessive inheritance rather than X-linked dominant inheritance.
2. **Male to male transmission**
   - *Incorrect.* In X-linked inheritance, males cannot transmit the trait to their sons because they pass the Y chromosome, not the X chromosome.
3. **Transmission only by females**
   - *Incorrect.* Both males and females can transmit X-linked dominant traits. However, males can only transmit to daughters, not sons.
4. **Transmitted by males only to females**
   - *Correct.* Affected males pass the X-linked dominant trait exclusively to their daughters, not to their sons, making this a defining feature of X-linked dominant inheritance.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks to identify a characteristic feature of X-linked dominant inheritance. This requires understanding the inheritance patterns of X-linked dominant disorders, including transmission probabilities, gender-specific expression, and parent-offspring transmission rules.  

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **X-linked dominant inheritance**:  
  - The disease-causing allele is located on the X chromosome.  
  - Both males (hemizygous) and females (heterozygous or homozygous) can be affected.  
  - **Transmission rules**:  
    - **Affected males** transmit the allele to **all daughters** (since males pass their X to daughters and Y to sons).  
    - **Affected females** (heterozygous) have a **50% chance** of passing the allele to each child (sons or daughters).  
    - Sons of affected males cannot inherit the X-linked allele and thus cannot be affected via paternal transmission.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Parental consanguinity**  
  - **Incorrect**. Consanguinity increases the risk of recessive disorders (e.g., autosomal or X-linked recessive) but is not specific to X-linked dominant inheritance.  

- **Option 2: Male to male transmission**  
  - **Incorrect**. Males inherit their X chromosome from their mother and pass their Y chromosome to sons. Thus, males cannot transmit X-linked alleles to their sons.  

- **Option 3: Transmission only by females**  
  - **Incorrect**. Females can transmit X-linked dominant alleles, but males also transmit their X chromosome to **all daughters**. Thus, males can also transmit the allele.  

- **Option 4: Transmitted by males only to females**  
  - **Correct**. Males pass their X chromosome **only to their daughters**, meaning any X-linked dominant allele in a male is transmitted exclusively to daughters. This is a defining feature of X-linked dominant inheritance.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  

**Explanation**:  
Option 4 is correct because males with an X-linked dominant disorder pass their X chromosome (and thus the disease allele) exclusively to their daughters. Sons receive the father’s Y chromosome and cannot inherit the X-linked allele from him. This aligns with the fundamental transmission rules of X-linked dominant inheritance. The other options either misrepresent transmission mechanisms (Options 2 and 3) or refer to unrelated factors (Option 1).

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks to identify a feature specific to X-linked dominant inheritance. This requires understanding the transmission patterns of X-linked dominant disorders, including how affected individuals pass the trait to offspring and the roles of parental sex in transmission.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **X-linked dominant inheritance**:  
  - The mutated gene resides on the X chromosome.  
  - A single copy of the mutation (in females: heterozygous; in males: hemizygous) is sufficient to cause the disorder.  
  - Affected males transmit the mutation to **all daughters** (they pass their X chromosome) but **no sons** (they pass their Y chromosome).  
  - Affected females (heterozygous) have a 50% chance of transmitting the mutation to sons or daughters.  
  - Male-to-male transmission is impossible (males pass Y, not X, to sons).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Parental consanguinity**  
  Incorrect. Consanguinity increases the risk of autosomal recessive disorders (shared recessive alleles) but is unrelated to X-linked dominant inheritance.  

- **Option 2: Male to male transmission**  
  Incorrect. X-linked traits cannot be transmitted from father to son, as males inherit the Y chromosome (not the X) from their fathers.  

- **Option 3: Transmission only by females**  
  Incorrect. While females can transmit X-linked dominant traits to both sexes, affected males can also transmit the mutation (exclusively to daughters).  

- **Option 4: Transmitted by males only to females**  
  Correct. Affected males pass their X chromosome (with the mutation) to all daughters but cannot transmit the trait to sons (they pass the Y chromosome). This is a hallmark of X-linked dominant inheritance.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  
This option accurately reflects the transmission pattern of X-linked dominant disorders, where affected males exclusively pass the mutated X chromosome to their daughters. No other option aligns with this mechanism.
