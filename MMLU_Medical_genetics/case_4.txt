**1. Question Analysis**
- The question is inquiring about the genetic inheritance pattern of malignant hyperthermia (also known as hyperpyrexia). Specifically, it seeks to determine whether this condition follows an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked dominant, or X-linked recessive inheritance pattern.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**
- Malignant hyperthermia is a pharmacogenetic disorder typically triggered by certain anesthetic agents. It is primarily associated with mutations in the RYR1 gene, which encodes the ryanodine receptor involved in calcium regulation in muscle cells, and sometimes the CACNA1S gene.
- The inheritance pattern of malignant hyperthermia is generally **autosomal dominant**. This means that a single copy of the mutated gene inherited from an affected parent can predispose an individual to the condition. While most cases follow this pattern, there are rare instances where it may appear autosomal recessive or result from de novo mutations, but these are exceptions rather than the rule.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Autosomal dominant.**
   - **Correct.** Malignant hyperthermia is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning only one copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to increase the risk of the disorder.
2. **Autosomal recessive.**
   - **Incorrect.** While possible in rare cases, this is not the primary inheritance pattern for malignant hyperthermia.
3. **X-linked dominant.**
   - **Incorrect.** There is no evidence to suggest that malignant hyperthermia is linked to the X chromosome.
4. **X-linked recessive.**
   - **Incorrect.** Similar to X-linked dominant, malignant hyperthermia is not associated with X-linked inheritance.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks about the inheritance pattern of malignant hyperthermia (hyperpyrexia), a genetic disorder triggered by specific anesthetic agents.  
- Key genetic concepts include understanding inheritance patterns (dominant vs. recessive, autosomal vs. X-linked) and the genetic basis of the disorder.  

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Genetic Basis**: Malignant hyperthermia is primarily caused by mutations in the *RYR1* gene (ryanodine receptor 1), which is located on chromosome 19. This gene encodes a calcium channel in skeletal muscle.  
- **Inheritance Pattern**: The disorder is inherited in an **autosomal dominant** manner. However, penetrance is incomplete—meaning not all individuals with the mutation will exhibit symptoms unless exposed to triggering agents (e.g., volatile anesthetics or succinylcholine).  
- **Mechanism**: Mutations in *RYR1* lead to uncontrolled calcium release in muscles, causing hypermetabolism, hyperthermia, and muscle rigidity when exposed to triggers.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Autosomal Dominant)**: Correct. Malignant hyperthermia is autosomal dominant. Even one copy of the mutated *RYR1* allele increases susceptibility, though symptoms require environmental triggers.  
- **Option 2 (Autosomal Recessive)**: Incorrect. Autosomal recessive inheritance would require two copies of the mutated allele. However, the dominant nature of *RYR1* mutations and family studies confirm dominance.  
- **Option 3 (X-Linked Dominant)**: Incorrect. The *RYR1* gene is on chromosome 19 (autosomal), not the X chromosome. X-linked inheritance is irrelevant here.  
- **Option 4 (X-Linked Recessive)**: Incorrect. Same reasoning as above; the gene is autosomal, and X-linked patterns do not apply.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**  

Malignant hyperthermia is caused by mutations in the *RYR1* gene, which follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. While penetrance is incomplete (symptoms only manifest with specific triggers), the genetic predisposition requires only one mutated allele, consistent with autosomal dominance. The other options are incorrect due to either incorrect chromosome location (X-linked) or inheritance mode (recessive).

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks for the inheritance pattern of malignant hyperthermia (MH), a pharmacogenetic disorder triggered by volatile anesthetics or succinylcholine. The answer requires understanding the genetic transmission of MH-associated gene mutations.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- MH is primarily linked to mutations in the *RYR1* gene (ryanodine receptor 1) on **chromosome 19 (autosomal)** and *CACNA1S* (calcium channel) on chromosome 1.  
- Inheritance patterns depend on whether one (dominant) or two (recessive) mutated alleles are required for phenotypic expression.  
- MH susceptibility follows **autosomal dominant inheritance**, as heterozygous mutations in *RYR1* or *CACNA1S* predispose individuals to the condition. Penetrance is incomplete, meaning not all carriers exhibit symptoms upon exposure to triggers.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Autosomal dominant):** Correct. MH susceptibility is transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner, with one mutated allele sufficient to confer risk.  
- **Option 2 (Autosomal recessive):** Incorrect. Recessive inheritance would require two mutated alleles, which is inconsistent with MH’s genetic profile.  
- **Option 3 (X-linked dominant) & 4 (X-linked recessive):** Incorrect. Both involve the X chromosome, but *RYR1* and *CACNA1S* are autosomal genes.  

**4. Final Selection**  
Malignant hyperthermia susceptibility is caused by heterozygous mutations in autosomal genes (*RYR1* or *CACNA1S*), aligning with **autosomal dominant inheritance**.  

**My final selection is: Option 1**
