**1. Question Analysis**  
The question is assessing the understanding of amino acid substitution notation in molecular genetics. Specifically, it requires interpreting what the notation "Asp235Phe" signifies in a molecular report. This involves knowledge of amino acid abbreviations and the convention used to denote substitutions in protein sequences.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Amino Acid Abbreviations:** Each amino acid is represented by a three-letter abbreviation. For example, Asp stands for aspartic acid, Asn for asparagine, and Phe for phenylalanine.
- **Substitution Notation:** The format "OriginalAminoAcidPositionNewAminoAcid" indicates that at a specific position in the protein sequence, one amino acid has been replaced by another. For instance, "Asp235Phe" means that at position 235, aspartic acid is replaced by phenylalanine.
- **Protein Structure and Function:** Such substitutions can impact the protein’s structure and function, potentially leading to genetic disorders if the change is deleterious.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Asparagine has been replaced by phenylalanine.**  
   - *Incorrect.* "Asp" stands for aspartic acid, not asparagine (which is abbreviated as Asn).
   
2. **Phenylalanine has been replaced by asparagine.**  
   - *Incorrect.* The notation indicates that aspartic acid is replaced by phenylalanine, not the other way around.
   
3. **Aspartic acid has been replaced by phenylalanine.**  
   - *Correct.* "Asp" corresponds to aspartic acid, and "Phe" corresponds to phenylalanine. The notation "Asp235Phe" means aspartic acid at position 235 is replaced by phenylalanine.
   
4. **Phenylalanine has been replaced by aspartic acid.**  
   - *Incorrect.* This is the reverse of what the notation indicates.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks about interpreting a mutation notation (Asp235Phe) to determine which amino acid substitution has occurred.  
- This relates to understanding standard genetic nomenclature for describing protein-coding mutations.  

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Amino Acid Abbreviations**:  
  - Asp = Aspartic Acid  
  - Phe = Phenylalanine  
  - Asn = Asparagine (not relevant here).  
- **Mutation Notation Format**:  
  The format [Original Amino Acid][Position][New Amino Acid] indicates a substitution where the original amino acid is replaced by the new one at the specified position. For example, Asp235Phe means aspartic acid at position 235 is replaced by phenylalanine.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: "Asparagine has been replaced by phenylalanine."  
  - Incorrect. This would be written as Asn235Phe. The original amino acid here is Asp (aspartic acid), not Asn (asparagine).  

- **Option 2**: "Phenylalanine has been replaced by asparagine."  
  - Incorrect. This reverses the substitution and uses the wrong amino acid abbreviation (Asn instead of Asp).  

- **Option 3**: "Aspartic acid has been replaced by phenylalanine."  
  - Correct. Asp corresponds to aspartic acid, and Phe is phenylalanine. The notation Asp235Phe directly matches this substitution.  

- **Option 4**: "Phenylalanine has been replaced by aspartic acid."  
  - Incorrect. This reverses the substitution (Phe → Asp instead of Asp → Phe) and uses the wrong amino acid abbreviations.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks to interpret the amino acid substitution denoted by "Asp235Phe" in a molecular report, focusing on understanding standard genetic notation for mutations.  

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- Amino acid substitutions are written in the format: **Original amino acid** (3-letter code) → **Position** → **New amino acid** (3-letter code).  
- **Asp** (aspartic acid) and **Asn** (asparagine) are distinct amino acids; confusion between them is a common pitfall.  
- **Phe** is the 3-letter code for phenylalanine.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Incorrect. "Asp" refers to aspartic acid, not asparagine (which is "Asn").  
- **Option 2**: Incorrect. Reversal of substitution direction (Phe → Asn) and misidentification of "Asp" as asparagine.  
- **Option 3**: Correct. "Asp" = aspartic acid; "Phe" = phenylalanine. The notation indicates aspartic acid at position 235 is replaced by phenylalanine.  
- **Option 4**: Incorrect. Reversal of substitution direction (Phe → Asp).  

**4. Final Selection**  
- The correct interpretation of "Asp235Phe" is aspartic acid (Asp) replaced by phenylalanine (Phe) at position 235.  

**My final selection is: Option 3**
