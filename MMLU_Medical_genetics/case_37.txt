**1. Question Analysis**
- The question is asking about the definition of a **homeotic mutation** within the context of medical genetics. It requires understanding what a homeotic mutation entails in terms of developmental biology and its effects on an organism's body plan.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**
- **Homeotic Genes:** These are genes that control the body plan of an organism during embryonic development. They determine the identity and arrangement of body segments and structures.
- **Homeotic Mutations:** These mutations alter the function of homeotic genes, leading to the transformation of one body part into another. This can result in structures developing in incorrect locations or different forms than originally specified.

**3. Analysis of Options**

1. **Option 1: is present in only one form in an individual**
   - *Analysis:* This describes **allelic variation** or **homogeneity** in an individual's genotype but does not pertain to homeotic mutations.
   - *Conclusion:* **Incorrect**

2. **Option 2: substitutes one body part for another in development**
   - *Analysis:* This accurately reflects the nature of homeotic mutations, where one body part may develop in place of another due to alterations in homeotic genes.
   - *Conclusion:* **Correct**

3. **Option 3: results in development of a tumor**
   - *Analysis:* Tumor development is typically associated with oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, not specifically with homeotic mutations.
   - *Conclusion:* **Incorrect**

4. **Option 4: is wild type at one temperature and abnormal at another**
   - *Analysis:* This describes a **temperature-sensitive** mutation, which is unrelated to homeotic mutations.
   - *Conclusion:* **Incorrect**

**4. Final Selection**
- **My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks about the definition of a homeotic mutation. This pertains to developmental genetics, specifically mutations affecting body plan patterning. The key concept involves understanding how mutations in certain genes can alter the identity of body structures during embryonic development.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Homeotic Mutations**: These arise from mutations in Hox genes, which regulate the spatial organization of body segments in animals.  
- **Mechanism**: Hox genes specify positional identity (e.g., head vs. tail, anterior vs. posterior). Mutations cause one body part to develop as another (e.g., legs instead of antennae in flies).  
- **Classic Example**: The *Antennapedia* mutation in fruit flies causes legs to form in place of antennae.  
- **Contrast with Other Mutations**:  
  - Temperature-sensitive mutations (option 4) involve phenotypic expression dependent on temperature.  
  - Tumors (option 3) relate to dysregulated cell proliferation, not structural body plan changes.  
  - Single-allele presence (option 1) refers to genetic dominance or allele frequency, unrelated to homeosis.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Incorrect. A homeotic mutation does not describe the presence of a single allele. This likely confuses dominance/recessiveness or allele count with structural changes.  
- **Option 2**: Correct. Homeotic mutations directly substitute one body part for another during development, as seen in classic examples like *Antennapedia*.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. Tumors result from mutations in oncogenes or tumor suppressors, not homeotic genes.  
- **Option 4**: Incorrect. Temperature-sensitive mutations are conditional mutations, unrelated to body part substitution.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks for the definition of a **homeotic mutation**, focusing on its developmental consequences. This requires understanding how mutations in homeotic genes affect body plan organization during embryogenesis.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Homeotic genes** (e.g., *Hox* genes in humans) regulate the identity of body segments and structures during development.  
- A **homeotic mutation** disrupts these genes, causing one body part to develop in place of another (e.g., legs growing where antennae should be in fruit flies).  
- Such mutations are distinct from oncogenic mutations (tumor-related), temperature-sensitive mutations, or allelic variants (homozygous/heterozygous states).

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1** ("present in only one form in an individual"): Incorrect. This describes a homozygous genotype, unrelated to homeotic mutations.  
- **Option 2** ("substitutes one body part for another in development"): Correct. Homeotic mutations alter developmental pathways, leading to structural transformations (e.g., vertebral anomalies in humans).  
- **Option 3** ("results in development of a tumor"): Incorrect. Tumorigenesis involves oncogenes or tumor suppressors, not homeotic genes.  
- **Option 4** ("wild type at one temperature and abnormal at another"): Incorrect. This describes temperature-sensitive mutations, a separate category unrelated to body plan defects.

**4. Final Selection**  
- **My final selection is: Option 2**  
- **Explanation**: Homeotic mutations specifically disrupt the positional identity of developing structures, leading to the replacement of one body part with another. This aligns with the classic definition and examples (e.g., *Antennapedia* in fruit flies or *HOX* gene defects in humans). Other options describe unrelated genetic phenomena.
