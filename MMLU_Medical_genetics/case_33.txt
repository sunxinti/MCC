**1. Question Analysis**
- The question presents a genetic cross between two true-breeding plant lines with distinct flower colors: dark blue and bright white. The F₁ generation exhibits a light blue phenotype. Selfing the F₁ progeny results in a phenotypic ratio of 1 dark blue : 2 light blue : 1 white in the F₂ generation.
- The inquiry seeks to identify the genetic phenomenon that best explains the observed inheritance pattern of flower color across generations.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**
- **True-Breeding Lines:** These are homozygous lines where parents consistently produce offspring with the same phenotype across generations when selfed.
- **F₁ Generation Phenotype:** The intermediate light blue color suggests a blending or intermediate expression between the two parental traits.
- **F₂ Generation Ratio:** A 1:2:1 phenotypic ratio is indicative of a specific inheritance pattern where heterozygotes display a distinct phenotype from both homozygotes.
- **Genetic Concepts Relevant:**
  - **Incomplete Dominance:** A form of inheritance where neither allele is completely dominant over the other, resulting in a blended phenotype in heterozygotes.
  - **Codominance:** Both alleles are fully expressed in the phenotype, leading to a simultaneous display of both traits without blending.
  - **Epistasis:** Interaction between different genes where one gene masks or modifies the expression of another.
  - **Inbreeding Depression:** Reduced biological fitness in a population due to inbreeding, not directly related to the specific phenotypic ratios observed.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Epistasis**
   - *Explanation:* Involves interaction between different genes affecting a phenotype.
   - *Relevance:* The question describes a single-gene trait with different alleles, not interactions between multiple genes.
   - *Conclusion:* Incorrect.

2. **Incomplete Dominance**
   - *Explanation:* Neither allele is fully dominant, resulting in an intermediate phenotype in heterozygotes.
   - *Relevance:* The F₁ generation exhibits a light blue phenotype, intermediate between dark blue and white, and the F₂ ratio of 1:2:1 aligns with incomplete dominance.
   - *Conclusion:* Correct.

3. **Codominance**
   - *Explanation:* Both alleles are fully expressed simultaneously without blending.
   - *Relevance:* Would result in offspring displaying both dark blue and white traits distinctly, not an intermediate light blue.
   - *Conclusion:* Incorrect.

4. **Inbreeding Depression**
   - *Explanation:* Reduction in fitness and health due to inbreeding.
   - *Relevance:* Not related to the specific inheritance pattern or phenotypic ratios described.
   - *Conclusion:* Incorrect.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question examines the inheritance pattern of flower color in a cross between two true-breeding parents. The F1 generation shows an intermediate phenotype (light blue), and the F2 generation exhibits a 1:2:1 phenotypic ratio. The goal is to identify the genetic mechanism responsible for these observations.  

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Incomplete Dominance**: A scenario where the F1 heterozygote exhibits a blended or intermediate phenotype between the two parents. In subsequent generations, selfing the F1 produces a 1:2:1 phenotypic ratio (e.g., dark blue:light blue:white).  
- **Codominance**: Both parental phenotypes are fully expressed in the heterozygote (e.g., red and white flowers appearing as pink is incomplete dominance, but codominance would show both colors separately).  
- **Epistasis**: Interaction between genes where one gene masks or modifies the expression of another, often leading to non-Mendelian ratios (e.g., 9:3:4).  
- **Inbreeding Depression**: Reduced fitness in offspring of closely related parents, unrelated to phenotypic ratios.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Epistasis)**: Incorrect. Epistasis typically involves multiple genes interacting to produce non-simple ratios (e.g., 12:3:1 or 9:3:4). The observed 1:2:1 ratio does not align with epistatic interactions.  
- **Option 2 (Incomplete Dominance)**: Correct. The F1 intermediate phenotype (light blue) and the 1:2:1 F2 ratio (dark blue:light blue:white) are classic signatures of incomplete dominance. Here, the heterozygote (e.g., *Bb*) displays an intermediate trait, and selfing produces genotypes in a 1:2:1 ratio.  
- **Option 3 (Codominance)**: Incorrect. Codominance would result in both parental phenotypes being visible in the heterozygote (e.g., dark and white flowers coexisting), not an intermediate blend. The light blue F1 does not fit codominance.  
- **Option 4 (Inbreeding Depression)**: Incorrect. This refers to reduced viability or fertility in inbred populations, not phenotypic ratios. The question does not mention reduced fitness.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  
The observed 1:2:1 phenotypic ratio and the intermediate F1 phenotype are hallmark features of **incomplete dominance**, where the heterozygote displays an intermediate trait between the two homozygous parents. This matches the scenario described in the question.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question examines the genetic phenomenon explaining a cross between true-breeding dark blue and white flower lines, producing F1 light blue offspring and a 1:2:1 F2 phenotypic ratio. This requires identifying the inheritance pattern that explains intermediate F1 phenotypes and a tri-phenotypic F2 distribution.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **True-breeding parents** indicate homozygous genotypes.  
- **F1 phenotype (light blue)** suggests an intermediate trait, not matching either parent.  
- **F2 ratio (1:2:1)** aligns with a monohybrid cross involving two alleles.  
- **Incomplete dominance** occurs when heterozygotes exhibit a blended phenotype (e.g., light blue from dark blue and white alleles), and F2 progeny segregate into three phenotypes in a 1:2:1 ratio.  
- **Codominance** involves simultaneous expression of both alleles (e.g., speckled phenotypes), not blending.  
- **Epistasis** requires interaction between two genes, typically altering expected phenotypic ratios (e.g., 9:3:4).  
- **Inbreeding depression** refers to reduced fitness due to homozygous deleterious alleles, unrelated to phenotypic ratios here.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Epistasis**: Incorrect. The 1:2:1 ratio stems from a single gene, not gene interactions.  
2. **Incomplete dominance**: Correct. The F1 intermediate phenotype and F2 1:2:1 ratio match this mechanism.  
3. **Codominance**: Incorrect. Codominance would produce distinct expression of both parental traits (e.g., speckled flowers), not a blended color.  
4. **Inbreeding depression**: Incorrect. This concept pertains to reduced fitness, not inheritance patterns or phenotypic ratios.

**4. Final Selection**  
The observed results—intermediate F1 phenotypes and a 1:2:1 F2 ratio—are hallmarks of **incomplete dominance**, where heterozygotes display a blended phenotype and homozygous genotypes express parental traits.  

**My final selection is: Option 2**
