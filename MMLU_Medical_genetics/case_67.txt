**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is assessing the understanding of inheritance patterns, specifically X-linked inheritance. It requires identifying which of the listed disorders does not follow an X-linked mode of inheritance.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **X-linked Inheritance:** This refers to genes located on the X chromosome. Disorders can be X-linked recessive or dominant. Males, having only one X chromosome, are more frequently affected by X-linked recessive disorders.
- **Autosomal Inheritance:** Disorders not linked to sex chromosomes are inherited in an autosomal dominant or recessive pattern.
- **Disorders in Question:**
  - **Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy:** X-linked recessive.
  - **Tay-Sachs Disease:** Autosomal recessive.
  - **Haemophilia A and B:** Both are X-linked recessive disorders.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy**
   - **Inheritance Pattern:** X-linked recessive.
   - **Conclusion:** Shows X-linked inheritance.  
2. **Tay-Sachs Disease**
   - **Inheritance Pattern:** Autosomal recessive.
   - **Conclusion:** Does **not** show X-linked inheritance.  
3. **Haemophilia A**
   - **Inheritance Pattern:** X-linked recessive.
   - **Conclusion:** Shows X-linked inheritance.  
4. **Haemophilia B**
   - **Inheritance Pattern:** X-linked recessive.
   - **Conclusion:** Shows X-linked inheritance.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks which disorder does not follow an X-linked inheritance pattern.  
- It requires knowledge of the inheritance patterns of the listed disorders, specifically distinguishing between X-linked and autosomal recessive/other patterns.  

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **X-linked recessive disorders**:  
  - Caused by mutations in genes on the X chromosome.  
  - Primarily affect males (hemizygous) but can manifest in females (heterozygotes) if the normal allele is inactivated (skewed X-inactivation).  
  - Examples include Duchenne muscular dystrophy, hemophilia A, and hemophilia B.  
- **Autosomal recessive disorders**:  
  - Caused by mutations in genes on non-sex chromosomes.  
  - Both parents must be carriers for a child to be affected.  
  - Examples include Tay-Sachs disease.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Duchenne muscular dystrophy)**:  
  - Caused by mutations in the *DMD* gene on the X chromosome (Xp21).  
  - Classic X-linked recessive disorder. **Correctly X-linked.**  
- **Option 2 (Tay-Sachs disease)**:  
  - Caused by mutations in the *HEXA* gene on chromosome 15 (autosomal).  
  - Follows an autosomal recessive pattern. **Not X-linked.**  
- **Option 3 (Haemophilia A)**:  
  - Caused by mutations in the *F8* gene on the X chromosome (Xq28).  
  - X-linked recessive disorder. **Correctly X-linked.**  
- **Option 4 (Haemophilia B)**:  
  - Caused by mutations in the *F9* gene on the X chromosome (Xq27).  
  - X-linked recessive disorder. **Correctly X-linked.**  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  

Tay-Sachs disease is caused by mutations in an autosomal gene (*HEXA*), making it an autosomal recessive disorder. The other options (Duchenne muscular dystrophy, hemophilia A, and hemophilia B) are all caused by mutations in X-linked genes, confirming their X-linked recessive inheritance patterns. Thus, Tay-Sachs is the correct answer.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question requires identifying the disorder that does not follow X-linked inheritance. This involves distinguishing between X-linked (recessive or dominant) and other inheritance patterns (autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant) for each listed condition.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **X-linked inheritance** involves genes on the X chromosome. Males are more frequently affected in X-linked recessive disorders due to hemizygosity.  
- **Autosomal recessive inheritance** involves mutations in genes on autosomes (non-sex chromosomes), requiring two defective alleles for disease manifestation.  
- **Disorder-specific genetics**: Accurate classification of each disorder’s inheritance pattern is critical.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)**  
  Caused by mutations in the *DMD* gene on the X chromosome (Xp21.2). Follows X-linked recessive inheritance. **Incorrect**.  

- **Option 2: Tay-Sachs disease**  
  Caused by mutations in the *HEXA* gene (chromosome 15q23), leading to hexosaminidase A deficiency. Inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. **Correct** (not X-linked).  

- **Option 3: Haemophilia A**  
  Caused by mutations in the *F8* gene (Xq28), encoding factor VIII. Follows X-linked recessive inheritance. **Incorrect**.  

- **Option 4: Haemophilia B**  
  Caused by mutations in the *F9* gene (Xq27.1), encoding factor IX. Follows X-linked recessive inheritance. **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
Tay-Sachs disease (Option 2) is the only disorder listed with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, distinct from the X-linked inheritance of the other options.  

**My final selection is: Option 2**
