**1. Question Analysis**  
The question is inquiring about the specific gene mutation responsible for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). It requires identifying the protein or receptor encoded by the gene that, when mutated, leads to FH, a genetic disorder characterized by high cholesterol levels, particularly low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
Familial hypercholesterolemia is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning only one copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the disorder. FH is most commonly caused by mutations in the gene that encodes the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. The LDL receptor plays a crucial role in clearing LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream. Mutations in this receptor reduce its ability to remove LDL cholesterol, leading to elevated blood cholesterol levels and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

**3. Analysis of Options**  

- **Option 1: High density lipoprotein**  
  *Incorrect.* High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is involved in reverse cholesterol transport but is not the primary focus in familial hypercholesterolemia.

- **Option 2: HMG-CoA reductase**  
  *Incorrect.* HMG-CoA reductase is the rate-controlling enzyme in cholesterol synthesis. While it's a target for statin drugs, mutations in this enzyme are not the primary cause of FH.

- **Option 3: Low density lipoprotein**  
  *Incorrect.* LDL itself is a carrier of cholesterol but is not a gene. The disorder is related to the receptor for LDL, not LDL itself.

- **Option 4: Low density lipoprotein receptor**  
  *Correct.* Mutations in the gene encoding the LDL receptor impair the removal of LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream, leading to FH.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks about the gene mutated in familial hypercholesterolaemia, a genetic disorder characterized by elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. The key genetic concept involves understanding the molecular basis of this inherited disorder and the specific gene product involved in cholesterol metabolism.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- Familial hypercholesterolaemia is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by defects in the cellular uptake of LDL cholesterol. The primary genetic defect involves the **LDL receptor**, which is responsible for removing LDL from the bloodstream. Mutations in the gene encoding this receptor impair LDL clearance, leading to high LDL levels and associated cardiovascular risks.  
- The LDL receptor is encoded by the *LDLR* gene. Other genes, such as *APOB* (encoding apolipoprotein B) and *PCSK9* (regulating LDL receptor degradation), can also cause hypercholesterolemia but are less commonly associated with the classic familial form.  
- HMG-CoA reductase (*HMGCR*) is the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis and is a target of statins. Mutations in *HMGCR* are not linked to familial hypercholesterolaemia but may influence cholesterol levels in other contexts.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (High density lipoprotein):** Incorrect. HDL is a lipoprotein involved in reverse cholesterol transport but is not directly encoded by the gene mutated in familial hypercholesterolaemia.  
- **Option 2 (HMG-CoA reductase):** Incorrect. This enzyme is part of cholesterol biosynthesis, and its inhibition (e.g., by statins) increases LDL receptor expression. However, mutations in *HMGCR* do not cause familial hypercholesterolaemia.  
- **Option 3 (Low density lipoprotein):** Incorrect. LDL is the lipoprotein whose clearance is impaired in this disorder, but the gene mutated encodes the receptor for LDL, not the LDL particle itself.  
- **Option 4 (Low density lipoprotein receptor):** Correct. Mutations in the *LDLR* gene disrupt LDL receptor function, preventing efficient LDL uptake and causing elevated plasma LDL levels.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which gene mutation causes familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a genetic disorder characterized by severely elevated LDL cholesterol levels. The answer requires knowledge of the molecular defect underlying FH.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- FH is primarily an autosomal dominant disorder caused by impaired clearance of LDL particles from the bloodstream.  
- The LDL receptor (LDLR) on hepatocytes binds LDL particles, facilitating their uptake and removal from circulation. Mutations in the *LDLR* gene disrupt this process, leading to hypercholesterolemia.  
- Less commonly, FH-like phenotypes arise from mutations in *APOB* (affecting LDL binding to LDLR) or *PCSK9* (enhancing LDLR degradation), but the hallmark cause is *LDLR* mutations.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (High density lipoprotein):** Incorrect. HDL is a lipoprotein involved in reverse cholesterol transport, unrelated to LDL receptor function.  
- **Option 2 (HMG-CoA reductase):** Incorrect. This enzyme regulates cholesterol synthesis, not LDL clearance. Statins target HMG-CoA reductase, but its mutations do not cause FH.  
- **Option 3 (Low density lipoprotein):** Incorrect. LDL itself is a lipoprotein particle, not a receptor. Mutations in LDL structural genes (e.g., *APOB*) are rare causes of FH but are not the primary focus here.  
- **Option 4 (Low density lipoprotein receptor):** Correct. Mutations in the *LDLR* gene are responsible for >90% of FH cases, impairing LDL uptake and causing hypercholesterolemia.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The correct answer is **Option 4**, as mutations in the LDL receptor gene (*LDLR*) are the definitive genetic cause of familial hypercholesterolemia.  

**My final selection is: Option 4**
