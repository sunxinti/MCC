================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is assessing the understanding of the inheritance pattern of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. It requires identifying whether G6PD deficiency is inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked dominant, or X-linked recessive manner.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **G6PD Deficiency:** G6PD deficiency is a genetic disorder affecting the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is crucial for red blood cell function.
- **Inheritance Patterns:**
  - **Autosomal Dominant:** A single copy of the mutated gene on any autosome leads to the disorder.
  - **Autosomal Recessive:** Two copies of the mutated gene on an autosome are necessary for the disorder to manifest.
  - **X-linked Dominant:** A single copy of the mutated gene on the X chromosome causes the disorder, affecting both males and females.
  - **X-linked Recessive:** The mutated gene is located on the X chromosome. Males are more frequently affected because they have only one X chromosome, while females are typically carriers unless they have two copies of the mutation.
- **G6PD Deficiency Specifics:** G6PD deficiency is known to be an X-linked recessive disorder. This explains the higher prevalence in males and carrier status in females.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: autosomal dominant.**  
  - **Incorrect.** G6PD deficiency is not autosomal nor dominant.
- **Option 2: autosomal recessive.**  
  - **Incorrect.** The disorder is not linked to autosomal recessive inheritance.
- **Option 3: X-linked dominant.**  
  - **Incorrect.** While G6PD deficiency is X-linked, it follows a recessive, not dominant, pattern.
- **Option 4: X-linked recessive.**  
  - **Correct.** G6PD deficiency follows an X-linked recessive inheritance pattern, affecting males predominantly and females as carriers.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks about the inheritance pattern of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.  
- Key genetic concepts involved include X-linked inheritance patterns and the distinction between dominant and recessive traits.  

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **G6PD Deficiency Basics**:  
  - G6PD is an enzyme encoded by the *G6PD* gene located on the X chromosome (Xq28).  
  - Deficiency leads to hemolytic anemia under oxidative stress (e.g., infections, certain drugs).  
- **Inheritance Pattern**:  
  - X-linked recessive disorders typically affect males more frequently because they have only one X chromosome. Females require two mutated alleles to manifest the disorder.  
  - Carrier females (heterozygotes) may show mild symptoms due to variable X-inactivation but are usually asymptomatic.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Autosomal dominant)**: Incorrect.  
  - G6PD deficiency is not autosomal; the gene is on the X chromosome. Autosomal dominant disorders affect both sexes equally and require only one mutated allele, which does not align with the observed male predominance in G6PD deficiency.  

- **Option 2 (Autosomal recessive)**: Incorrect.  
  - Again, the *G6PD* gene is X-linked, not autosomal. Autosomal recessive disorders require two mutated alleles in both sexes, but G6PD deficiency manifests in males with a single mutated allele.  

- **Option 3 (X-linked dominant)**: Incorrect.  
  - In X-linked dominant disorders, heterozygous females (e.g., carriers) typically show symptoms, but most females with G6PD deficiency are asymptomatic unless they have two mutated alleles or skewed X-inactivation. This makes X-linked recessive a better fit.  

- **Option 4 (X-linked recessive)**: Correct.  
  - Males (hemizygous for the X chromosome) express the disorder with a single mutated allele. Females require two mutated alleles to manifest severe symptoms, aligning perfectly with the clinical presentation of G6PD deficiency.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks for the inheritance pattern of G6PD deficiency. This requires understanding how genetic mutations in the G6PD gene are transmitted across generations and whether the gene is located on an autosome or the X chromosome.  

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Gene location**: G6PD deficiency is caused by mutations in the *G6PD* gene, located on the **X chromosome** (Xq28).  
- **Inheritance mechanism**: Since the gene is X-linked, males (XY) inherit one X chromosome (from the mother) and are **hemizygous** for X-linked traits. A single pathogenic variant in their X chromosome will manifest the disorder. Females (XX) require mutations in both X chromosomes to show symptoms, making them more likely to be carriers.  
- **Clinical correlation**: G6PD deficiency predominantly affects males, with females affected only in rare cases (e.g., skewed X-inactivation or homozygous mutations). This aligns with **X-linked recessive** inheritance.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (autosomal dominant)**: Incorrect. Autosomal dominant disorders require only one copy of a mutated gene (on an autosome) to cause disease. G6PD deficiency does not follow this pattern.  
- **Option 2 (autosomal recessive)**: Incorrect. Autosomal recessive disorders require two mutated alleles (one from each parent). G6PD deficiency is not autosomal, and males are affected with a single mutation.  
- **Option 3 (X-linked dominant)**: Incorrect. X-linked dominant disorders affect females more frequently (as they have two X chromosomes), and males are typically more severely affected. G6PD deficiency does not fit this pattern.  
- **Option 4 (X-linked recessive)**: Correct. Males are primarily affected due to hemizygosity, and females are usually asymptomatic carriers. This matches the clinical and genetic features of G6PD deficiency.  

**4. Final Selection**  
- The inheritance pattern of G6PD deficiency is X-linked recessive, as the causative gene is located on the X chromosome, and males are affected with a single mutation while females are typically carriers.  
**My final selection is: Option 4**
