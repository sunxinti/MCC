================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**
- The question is focused on understanding how restriction enzymes interact with DNA sequences. Specifically, it asks for the average number of fragments produced when a restriction enzyme, which recognizes a specific 4-base pair sequence, cleaves a double-stranded bacteriophage genome of 5,000 base pairs (bp).

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**
- **Restriction Enzymes:** These are proteins that recognize specific short DNA sequences and cleave the DNA at or near these sites. The specificity is determined by the length and sequence of the recognition site.
- **Recognition Site Frequency:** For a recognition site that is 4 base pairs long, assuming a uniform distribution of nucleotides, the probability of any specific 4-base sequence occurring is \( \frac{1}{4^4} = \frac{1}{256} \) per base pair.
- **Expected Number of Cuts:** The total number of cuts in the DNA can be estimated by dividing the genome size by the probability of the recognition site. The number of fragments will be approximately the number of cuts plus one.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **About 2:**  
   - **Calculation:** \( \frac{5,000}{256} \approx 19.5 \) cuts → Approximately 20 fragments.  
   - **Evaluation:** Significantly lower than calculated expectation. **Incorrect**.
   
2. **About 4:**  
   - **Calculation:** Similar to option 1.  
   - **Evaluation:** Still much lower than the expected number. **Incorrect**.
   
3. **About 20:**  
   - **Calculation:** \( \frac{5,000}{256} \approx 19.5 \) → Approximately 20 fragments.  
   - **Evaluation:** Closely matches the calculated expectation. **Correct**.
   
4. **About 50:**  
   - **Calculation:** This would imply \( \frac{5,000}{50} = 100 \) bp per fragment, which suggests a recognition site frequency of 1/100, not 1/256.  
   - **Evaluation:** Higher than the expected number based on calculations. **Incorrect**.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks about the number of DNA fragments generated by a restriction enzyme with a 4-base recognition sequence in a 5,000 bp bacteriophage genome.  
- Key concepts involve understanding restriction enzyme recognition site frequency, genome size, and fragment calculation.  

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Restriction Enzyme Recognition Sites**:  
  - A 4-base recognition sequence occurs every \(4^n\) base pairs, where \(n\) is the number of bases. For a 4-base enzyme, this is \(4^4 = 256\) bp on average.  
  - The number of fragments depends on how many times the enzyme cuts the DNA.  
- **Fragment Calculation**:  
  - The average number of cuts in a genome is \(\frac{\text{Genome size}}{\text{Average distance between cuts}}\).  
  - The number of fragments is one more than the number of cuts.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (about 2)**: Incorrect.  
  - A 4-base enzyme cuts every ~256 bp. For a 5,000 bp genome, this would result in ~19 cuts, leading to ~20 fragments. Only 2 fragments would imply a much longer recognition site (e.g., 6 bases: \(4^6 = 4096\) bp).  

- **Option 2 (about 4)**: Incorrect.  
  - This would require a recognition site longer than 4 bases (e.g., 5 bases: \(4^5 = 1024\) bp, yielding ~5 cuts and ~6 fragments).  

- **Option 3 (about 20)**: Correct.  
  - Calculation: \( \frac{5000}{256} \approx 19.5 \) cuts → ~20 fragments. This aligns with a 4-base recognition sequence.  

- **Option 4 (about 50)**: Incorrect.  
  - This would require a much shorter recognition site (e.g., 3 bases: \(4^3 = 64\) bp, yielding ~78 cuts and ~79 fragments).  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks for the average number of DNA fragments generated when a 4-base specific restriction enzyme cleaves a 5,000 bp bacteriophage genome. This involves understanding restriction enzyme cutting frequency and statistical expectations based on genome size and recognition site length.  

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Restriction enzyme recognition sites**: A 4-base recognition site occurs with a probability of \( \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^4 = \frac{1}{256} \).  
- **Expected number of cuts**: Calculated as \( \frac{\text{Genome size}}{\text{Recognition site frequency}} \). For 5,000 bp: \( \frac{5000}{256} \approx 19.5 \).  
- **Fragments vs. cuts**: Number of fragments = Number of cuts + 1.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (about 2)**: Incorrect. A 4-base cutter cuts far more frequently than this; 2 fragments would imply only 1 cut, typical for rare 6-8 base enzymes.  
- **Option 2 (about 4)**: Incorrect. Similar reasoning; 4 fragments would require ~3 cuts, inconsistent with the high frequency of 4-base recognition sites.  
- **Option 3 (about 20)**: Correct. \( \frac{5000}{256} \approx 19.5 \) cuts, leading to ~20 fragments.  
- **Option 4 (about 50)**: Incorrect. This would require ~49 cuts, far exceeding the expected frequency of 4-base sites.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  
The calculation aligns with the statistical expectation: ~19.5 cuts yield ~20 fragments. This matches the theoretical prediction for a 4-base cutter applied to a 5,000 bp genome.
