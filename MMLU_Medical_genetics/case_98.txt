================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question addresses how the unequal distribution of substances within an egg influences embryonic development. It seeks to understand the role of these substances in directing the developmental patterns as the embryo undergoes cell division.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- In developmental genetics, the differential distribution of cytoplasmic determinants (substances localized in specific regions of the egg) is crucial for establishing the body plan of the organism.
- These localized substances influence gene expression in different regions of the embryo, leading to spatial differentiation and the formation of various tissues and organs.
- This process does not typically involve changes in gene copy number (amplification or loss) but rather the regulation of existing genes' expression levels.

**3. Analysis of Options**

1. **Differences in gene expression which may establish a pattern in the embryo as the cells divide**  
   - **Correct.** Differential distribution of substances in the egg leads to variable gene expression across different regions, guiding the spatial organization and patterning of the embryo during cell division.

2. **Amplification of specific genes during development**  
   - **Incorrect.** Gene amplification refers to an increase in the number of copies of a gene, which is not a direct consequence of the distribution of substances in the egg.

3. **Development of polyploid tissues**  
   - **Incorrect.** Polyploidy involves having more than two complete sets of chromosomes, which is unrelated to the localized distribution of substances within the egg.

4. **Loss of specific genes during development**  
   - **Incorrect.** Gene loss involves the deletion or inactivation of genes, which is not a typical result of differential substance distribution in the egg.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks about the consequence of differential distribution of substances within an egg, a process critical for early embryonic development. This relates to genetic concepts of developmental biology, specifically how spatial patterns and gene expression are established in the embryo. The key focus is on understanding how localized molecules in the egg influence subsequent cell fate and patterning.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Maternal Effect Genes**: Many organisms (e.g., *Drosophila*) rely on maternal effect genes, whose products (mRNAs, proteins) are asymmetrically distributed in the egg. These substances form concentration gradients that direct axial patterning (e.g., head-to-tail or dorsal-ventral axes) in the embryo.  
- **Morphogen Gradients**: These gradients act as positional cues, triggering distinct gene expression programs in different regions of the embryo as cells divide. For example, the *bicoid* mRNA gradient in fruit flies establishes anterior structures.  
- **Developmental Patterning**: The localized distribution of maternal factors ensures that daughter cells inherit different molecular environments, leading to spatially restricted gene activation and cell differentiation.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Correct. The differential distribution of substances (e.g., mRNAs, proteins) in the egg creates gradients that influence gene expression in specific regions of the embryo. As cells divide, these positional cues propagate, establishing developmental patterns.  
- **Option 2**: Incorrect. Gene amplification refers to increased copies of specific genes (e.g., in cancer or specialized cells like ovarian follicles), not to the spatial distribution of maternal factors.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. Polyploid tissues arise from endoreduplication (mitosis without cytokinesis) or other mechanisms unrelated to egg substance distribution.  
- **Option 4**: Incorrect. Loss of genes typically involves deletions or mutations, not the localized presence/absence of maternal factors. The substances themselves are not lost but differentially allocated.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**  

The differential distribution of substances in the egg creates spatial gradients that act as morphogens. These gradients directly influence gene expression in specific regions of the embryo, driving pattern formation as cells divide and differentiate. This mechanism is central to developmental biology and is exemplified by processes like *Drosophila* axis specification. The other options describe unrelated genetic phenomena.

DeepSeek的完整回答:
================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question focuses on the developmental consequences of unevenly distributed substances in an egg. It tests understanding of how cytoplasmic determinants (e.g., proteins, mRNAs) influence embryonic patterning and gene regulation during early development.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Cytoplasmic determinants**: Maternal substances localized in specific regions of the egg direct cell fate by regulating gene expression in daughter cells during cleavage.  
- **Embryonic patterning**: As cells divide, inherited determinants activate or repress genes, establishing spatial axes (e.g., anterior-posterior) and tissue differentiation.  
- **Gene amplification, polyploidy, and gene loss** are distinct processes unrelated to maternal substance distribution. Amplification (copying genes) occurs in contexts like rRNA production; polyploidy (multiple chromosome sets) is seen in specialized tissues (e.g., hepatocytes); gene loss is rare in development (except in specific somatic cells like lymphocytes).

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Correct. Differential distribution of maternal substances (e.g., morphogens) creates gradients that activate transcription factors in specific cells, altering gene expression and establishing embryonic patterns (e.g., bicoid in Drosophila).  
- **Option 2**: Incorrect. Gene amplification refers to replication of specific DNA regions (e.g., chorion genes in Drosophila follicles), not patterning.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. Polyploidy arises from endoreduplication (repeated DNA replication without mitosis), unrelated to maternal substance localization.  
- **Option 4**: Incorrect. Gene loss (e.g., chromosome loss in some somatic cells) is not a typical outcome of cytoplasmic determinants; most cells retain the genome.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**  
The differential distribution of maternal cytoplasmic substances directly regulates gene expression in early embryonic cells, establishing spatial patterns (e.g., body axes, germ layers) as divisions occur. This mechanism is foundational in developmental biology and aligns with Option 1.
