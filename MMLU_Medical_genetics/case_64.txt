**1. Question Analysis**
- The question is asking which pattern of genetic inheritance is characterized by the transmission of traits from father to son (male to male transmission). It requires identifying an inheritance pattern where male individuals can pass genetic traits directly to their male offspring, without being limited by sex chromosomes that might prevent such transmission.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**
- Understanding different inheritance patterns is crucial:
  - **Autosomal Dominant**: Traits are transmitted via non-sex chromosomes (autosomes) and can be passed from either parent to offspring regardless of sex. Male-to-male transmission is possible.
  - **Autosomal Recessive**: Also involves non-sex chromosomes, with traits appearing when an individual inherits two copies of the recessive allele. Male-to-male transmission is possible.
  - **X-linked Dominant**: Traits are associated with the X chromosome. Fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons because fathers pass the Y chromosome to sons.
  - **X-linked Recessive**: Similar to X-linked dominant in inheritance via the X chromosome. Fathers cannot transmit these traits to their sons, only to daughters.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Autosomal dominant**: Correct. Allows male-to-male transmission since the trait is not linked to sex chromosomes.
2. **Autosomal recessive**: Also allows male-to-male transmission but is less specifically associated with this feature compared to autosomal dominant.
3. **X-linked dominant**: Incorrect. Fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to sons.
4. **X-linked recessive**: Incorrect. Fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to sons.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks which inheritance pattern allows for male-to-male transmission. This involves understanding how different inheritance patterns (autosomal vs. X-linked, dominant vs. recessive) affect the transmission of traits between males.  

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Autosomal Inheritance**: Traits located on autosomes are inherited equally from both parents. Males can pass autosomal alleles to both sons and daughters.  
- **X-linked Inheritance**: Males inherit their X chromosome from their mother and Y from their father. Thus, males cannot pass their X chromosome to their sons (only to daughters).  
- **Key Features**:  
  - **X-linked recessive**: Cannot be transmitted from father to son.  
  - **X-linked dominant**: Males cannot pass the X-linked allele to sons.  
  - **Autosomal dominant/recessive**: Allow transmission from father to son, as autosomes are equally inherited.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Autosomal dominant)**:  
  - Males can pass the dominant allele to sons (50% chance). This is a key feature of autosomal dominant inheritance, enabling vertical transmission (father to son).  
  - **Correct**.  
- **Option 2 (Autosomal recessive)**:  
  - Males can pass a recessive allele to sons, but the son must inherit another recessive allele from the mother to express the trait.  
  - While transmission is possible, the key feature of autosomal recessive is the requirement of two copies for expression, not male-to-male transmission.  
  - **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 3 (X-linked dominant)**:  
  - Males pass their X chromosome only to daughters, not sons. Thus, male-to-male transmission is impossible.  
  - **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 4 (X-linked recessive)**:  
  - Males cannot pass their X chromosome to sons, so male-to-male transmission is impossible.  
  - **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**  
Autosomal dominant inheritance allows male-to-male transmission because the trait can be passed from an affected father to his sons. This distinguishes it from X-linked patterns, where males cannot transmit X-linked alleles to their sons. Autosomal dominant inheritance’s hallmark includes vertical transmission, making this the most accurate answer.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which inheritance pattern is characterized by male-to-male transmission. This requires understanding how alleles on different chromosomes (autosomes vs. sex chromosomes) are transmitted between generations, particularly from fathers to sons.  

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Male-to-male transmission** occurs only if a father passes a gene on his **Y chromosome** or an **autosome**. Fathers cannot transmit X-linked genes to sons because sons inherit the father’s Y chromosome (not X).  
- **X-linked inheritance** (options 3 and 4) excludes male-to-male transmission because X-linked alleles are on the X chromosome, which fathers pass only to daughters.  
- **Autosomal inheritance** (options 1 and 2) allows male-to-male transmission since autosomes are inherited equally by sons and daughters.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Autosomal dominant**  
  Autosomal dominant disorders involve genes on autosomes. Affected fathers (heterozygous or homozygous) have a 50% chance of passing the dominant allele to sons. Male-to-male transmission is a hallmark (e.g., Huntington’s disease). **Correct**.  
- **Option 2: Autosomal recessive**  
  While male-to-male transmission is theoretically possible, affected fathers must be homozygous (rare unless consanguinity occurs). This is not a defining feature of autosomal recessive inheritance. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 3: X-linked dominant**  
  Fathers cannot pass X-linked alleles to sons (sons inherit the Y chromosome). **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 4: X-linked recessive**  
  Similarly, X-linked alleles are not transmitted from fathers to sons. **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The ability for male-to-male transmission is a key feature of **autosomal dominant inheritance**, as it requires transmission of an autosomal allele, which fathers can pass to sons. X-linked inheritance inherently precludes this pattern.  

**My final selection is: Option 1**
