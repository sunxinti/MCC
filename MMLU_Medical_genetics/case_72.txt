**1. Question Analysis**
- The question is inquiring about the specific type of genetic mutation that is most frequently responsible for causing cystic fibrosis (CF). It requires an understanding of the genetic alterations in the CFTR gene that lead to the disorder.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**
- **Cystic Fibrosis (CF):** CF is a genetic disorder affecting the respiratory and digestive systems, among others. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.
- **CFTR Gene:** The CF Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene is responsible for producing a protein that regulates the movement of chloride and sodium ions across epithelial membranes.
- **Common Mutation:** The most prevalent mutation in the CFTR gene associated with CF is the ΔF508 mutation. This mutation involves the deletion of three nucleotides, resulting in the loss of the amino acid phenylalanine at position 508 of the protein.
- **Types of Mutations:**
  - **Deletion:** Removal of a segment of DNA.
  - **Duplication:** Copying of a DNA segment.
  - **Substitution:** Replacement of one nucleotide with another.
  - **Insertion:** Addition of extra nucleotides into the DNA sequence.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **a deletion.**
   - **Correct.** The ΔF508 mutation is a deletion of three nucleotides in the CFTR gene, making it the most common mutation causing CF.
2. **a duplication.**
   - **Incorrect.** Duplication mutations are less common in CF compared to deletions.
3. **a substitution.**
   - **Incorrect.** While substitutions do occur in the CFTR gene, they are not as prevalent as deletions like ΔF508 in causing CF.
4. **an insertion.**
   - **Incorrect.** Insertions are rare in the context of CFTR mutations leading to CF.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks about the most common mutation type associated with cystic fibrosis (CF). This requires knowledge of the genetic basis of CF, specifically the CFTR gene mutations, their types, and their prevalence.  

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **CFTR Gene**: CF is caused by mutations in the *CFTR* gene, which encodes a chloride channel. Over 2,000 mutations have been identified, but certain mutations are more common.  
- **ΔF508 Mutation**: The most frequent CF-causing mutation is a **deletion of three nucleotides** (TCT), leading to the loss of phenylalanine (F) at position 508 in the CFTR protein. This mutation accounts for ~70% of CF alleles in populations of European descent.  
- **Mutation Types**:  
  - **Deletion**: Removal of nucleotides (e.g., ΔF508).  
  - **Duplication**: Addition of a duplicated segment.  
  - **Substitution**: Replacement of a single nucleotide.  
  - **Insertion**: Addition of extra nucleotides.  
- **Clinical Prevalence**: ΔF508 is the prototypical CF mutation and the single most common cause of the disease.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Deletion)**: Correct. The ΔF508 mutation is a deletion of three nucleotides (TCT), directly removing phenylalanine 508. This is the most common CF mutation.  
- **Option 2 (Duplication)**: Incorrect. Duplications are rare in CF and not the most common mutation.  
- **Option 3 (Substitution)**: Incorrect. Substitutions (e.g., G542X) occur but are less frequent than deletions like ΔF508.  
- **Option 4 (Insertion)**: Incorrect. Insertions (e.g., 5T variant in the poly-T tract) can cause CF but are not the most common.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**  

The ΔF508 mutation, a deletion of three nucleotides, is the most common CFTR mutation and accounts for the majority of CF cases in populations of European ancestry. This deletion disrupts CFTR protein function, leading to the classic CF phenotype. No other mutation type (duplication, substitution, insertion) is as prevalent in CF.

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks about the mutation type most commonly associated with cystic fibrosis (CF). It requires knowledge of the specific genetic alteration in the CFTR gene responsible for the majority of CF cases.  

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the *CFTR* gene, which encodes a chloride channel. The most prevalent mutation worldwide is **ΔF508** (p.Phe508del).  
- This mutation involves the **deletion of three nucleotides** (CTT) at position 508 in exon 10 of the *CFTR* gene. This results in the loss of a phenylalanine residue (F508) and causes improper protein folding, leading to defective chloride transport.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (a deletion):** Correct. ΔF508 is a 3-base pair deletion, accounting for ~70% of CF alleles globally.  
- **Option 2 (a duplication):** Incorrect. Duplications are not associated with the majority of CF cases.  
- **Option 3 (a substitution):** Incorrect. Substitutions (e.g., missense mutations) occur in CF but are far less common than ΔF508.  
- **Option 4 (an insertion):** Incorrect. Insertions are rare in CF compared to deletions.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The most common cystic fibrosis mutation (ΔF508) is a deletion of three nucleotides, directly aligning with **Option 1**.  

**My final selection is: Option 1**
