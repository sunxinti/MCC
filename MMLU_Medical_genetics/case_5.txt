================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is focused on the mapping of human chromosomes, which involves identifying the specific locations of genes and genetic markers on chromosomes. It assesses understanding of the methodologies, advancements, and outcomes associated with chromosome mapping in human genetics.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Chromosome Mapping**: The process of determining the arrangement of genes and genetic markers on chromosomes. It is essential for identifying the genetic basis of diseases and traits.
- **DNA Markers**: Specific sequences in the genome used as reference points in mapping. The availability and density of DNA markers are crucial for the accuracy and success of chromosome mapping.
- **Linkage Groups**: Groups of genes that tend to be inherited together because they are located close to each other on the same chromosome. The number of linkage groups generally corresponds to the number of chromosome pairs.
- **Coding vs. Non-Coding DNA**: While only a small percentage of the human genome codes for proteins, mapping has revealed that a significant portion of DNA does not code for genes but may have regulatory or unknown functions.

**3. Analysis of Options**  

- **Option 1**: *"has been restricted to the sex chromosomes because of small family sizes"*  
  - **Incorrect**. Chromosome mapping has been conducted on all human chromosomes, not just the sex chromosomes. Family sizes can impact linkage studies, but mapping is not limited to sex chromosomes due to family size constraints.

- **Option 2**: *"proceeded much more successfully as large numbers of DNA markers became available."*  
  - **Correct**. The availability of a large number of DNA markers has significantly enhanced the success and resolution of chromosome mapping. High-density marker maps allow for more precise localization of genes and genetic traits.

- **Option 3**: *"has determined that the number of linkage groups is about twice the number of chromosomes"*  
  - **Incorrect**. The number of linkage groups typically corresponds to the number of chromosome pairs, not twice the number of chromosomes. Each linkage group generally represents one chromosome.

- **Option 4**: *"has demonstrated that almost all of the DNA is involved in coding for genes"*  
  - **Incorrect**. Chromosome mapping has shown that only a small fraction of the human genome consists of protein-coding genes. The majority of the DNA is non-coding, involved in regulatory functions or other roles not directly related to coding for proteins.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks about the accuracy of statements related to the mapping of human chromosomes. It requires knowledge of genetic mapping techniques, historical advancements, and basic genomic composition.  

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Genetic Mapping**: Involves determining the relative positions of genes or DNA markers on chromosomes. Early methods relied on family-based linkage analysis, while modern approaches use high-throughput DNA markers (e.g., SNPs) and physical mapping techniques.  
- **DNA Markers**: The availability of dense DNA markers (e.g., restriction fragment length polymorphisms, SNPs) improved mapping resolution and reduced reliance on large families.  
- **Linkage Groups**: Each chromosome corresponds to a linkage group. Humans have 23 linkage groups (one per chromosome pair).  
- **Genomic Composition**: Only ~1-2% of the human genome codes for protein-coding genes; the rest includes non-coding RNAs, regulatory elements, and repetitive sequences.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Incorrect. Chromosome mapping has never been restricted to sex chromosomes. Advances in DNA marker technology have enabled comprehensive mapping of all chromosomes, regardless of family size.  
- **Option 2**: Correct. The explosion of DNA markers (e.g., with the Human Genome Project and SNP arrays) revolutionized mapping by allowing high-resolution physical and genetic maps, even in smaller families.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. The number of linkage groups equals the number of chromosomes (23), not twice that number. This statement misrepresents basic genetic principles.  
- **Option 4**: Incorrect. Only a small fraction of the human genome encodes genes. Most DNA is non-coding, a well-established fact from genomic studies.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  

The availability of large numbers of DNA markers was a critical advancement in human chromosome mapping, enabling precise localization of genes and genetic variants. This aligns with historical and technical progress in genetics, unlike the inaccuracies in the other options.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question assesses understanding of human chromosome mapping advancements and challenges, focusing on historical progress, technological contributions (e.g., DNA markers), and misconceptions about genomic structure.  

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Chromosome Mapping**: Requires markers (e.g., SNPs, STRs) to track inheritance patterns and gene locations.  
- **Linkage Groups**: Equal to the haploid chromosome number (23 in humans).  
- **Coding vs. Non-Coding DNA**: Only ~1-2% of human DNA is protein-coding.  
- **Technological Advances**: Large-scale DNA marker availability (e.g., via microarrays, sequencing) revolutionized mapping precision.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Incorrect. Mapping is not restricted to sex chromosomes; autosomal mapping succeeded through pooled family data and population studies.  
- **Option 2**: Correct. DNA markers (e.g., SNPs, STRs) enabled high-resolution linkage and genome-wide association studies, accelerating mapping progress.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. Linkage groups (23) match the haploid chromosome count, not "twice" the diploid number (46).  
- **Option 4**: Incorrect. Non-coding DNA constitutes ~98% of the genome, refuting the claim that "almost all DNA codes for genes."  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  
- Option 2 is accurate because the proliferation of DNA markers (e.g., SNPs) provided the necessary tools for dense genetic maps, enabling breakthroughs like the Human Genome Project. Other options misrepresent historical limitations, linkage group biology, or genomic composition.
