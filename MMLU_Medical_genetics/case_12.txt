**1. Question Analysis**
- The question is addressing the genetic recurrence risk of schizophrenia among different relatives of an affected individual. It seeks to identify which relative has the highest probability of also being affected by schizophrenia based on their genetic relatedness.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**
- **Schizophrenia Genetics**: Schizophrenia is a complex psychiatric disorder with a multifactorial inheritance pattern, involving both genetic and environmental factors.
- **Recurrence Risk**: The risk of developing schizophrenia is influenced by the degree of genetic relatedness to an affected individual. First-degree relatives (parents, siblings, children) have a higher risk compared to second-degree relatives (aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, grandparents, grandchildren).
- **Degree of Relatedness**:
  - **First-Degree Relatives**: Share approximately 50% of their genes with the affected individual.
  - **Second-Degree Relatives**: Share about 25% of their genes with the affected individual.
- **General Risk Estimates**:
  - General population risk: ~1%
  - First-degree relatives: ~10%
  - Second-degree relatives: ~5%

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Brother**:
   - **Degree of Relatedness**: First-degree relative.
   - **Recurrence Risk**: Approximately 10%, which is significantly higher than the general population.
   - **Assessment**: Highest recurrence risk among the listed options.
2. **Nephew**:
   - **Degree of Relatedness**: Second-degree relative.
   - **Recurrence Risk**: Approximately 5%.
   - **Assessment**: Lower risk compared to first-degree relatives.
3. **Grandchild**:
   - **Degree of Relatedness**: Second-degree relative.
   - **Recurrence Risk**: Approximately 5%.
   - **Assessment**: Similar to nephews; lower than first-degree relatives.
4. **Aunt**:
   - **Degree of Relatedness**: Second-degree relative.
   - **Recurrence Risk**: Approximately 5%.
   - **Assessment**: Comparable to nephews and grandchildren; lower than first-degree relatives.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which relative of an affected individual with schizophrenia has the highest recurrence risk. Schizophrenia is a complex, multifactorial disorder influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Recurrence risk in relatives depends on their genetic relatedness to the affected individual, as closer relatives share more alleles identical by descent.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Recurrence Risk**: For multifactorial disorders like schizophrenia, recurrence risk increases with genetic relatedness. The closer the relative (higher coefficient of relationship), the higher the risk.  
- **Coefficient of Relationship (r)**:  
  - First-degree relatives (parent, child, sibling): r = 0.5 (share ~50% of genes).  
  - Second-degree relatives (aunt/uncle, grandparent, half-sibling, nephew/niece, grandchild): r = 0.25 (share ~25% of genes).  
- **Schizophrenia’s Heritability**: While environmental factors contribute, genetics play a significant role (~60–80% heritability). Recurrence risk calculations prioritize genetic relatedness here.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Brother)**: A brother is a first-degree relative (r = 0.5). He shares 50% of his genes with the affected individual, making him the most genetically similar. This confers the highest recurrence risk.  
- **Option 2 (Nephew)**: A nephew is the child of the affected individual’s sibling. As a second-degree relative (r = 0.25), he shares ~25% of genes with the affected individual, resulting in lower risk than a brother.  
- **Option 3 (Grandchild)**: A grandchild is also a second-degree relative (r = 0.25). The affected individual shares ~25% of genes with their grandchild, leading to a lower recurrence risk than a brother.  
- **Option 4 (Aunt)**: An aunt is a second-degree relative (r = 0.25). She shares ~25% of genes with the affected individual, placing her recurrence risk below that of a brother.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**  

The brother has the highest recurrence risk because he is a first-degree relative, sharing 50% of his genes with the affected individual. This genetic closeness outweighs the lower relatedness of the other options (all second-degree relatives with 25% shared genes). Schizophrenia’s multifactorial nature reinforces that genetic proximity is the key determinant here.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which relative of an individual with schizophrenia has the greatest recurrence risk. This hinges on understanding **polygenic/multifactorial inheritance** patterns and **degree of relatedness**, as schizophrenia is a complex disorder influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Schizophrenia**: A polygenic disorder with ~70-80% heritability, influenced by numerous susceptibility genes and environmental factors.  
- **Recurrence Risk**: Follows a pattern where risk correlates with genetic relatedness. First-degree relatives (sharing ~50% of genes) have higher risk than second-degree (~25%) or third-degree (~12.5%) relatives.  
- **Empirical Data**: Population risk is ~1%, first-degree relatives (e.g., siblings) have ~6-10% risk, second-degree relatives (e.g., nephews, aunts) ~3-4%, and third-degree even lower.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Brother)**: First-degree relative (shares 50% of genes). Highest recurrence risk (~6-10%). **Correct**.  
- **Option 2 (Nephew)** and **Option 3 (Grandchild)**: Both second-degree relatives (25% genetic sharing). Risk ~3-4%. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 4 (Aunt)**: Second-degree relative (25% genetic sharing). Risk ~3-4%. **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The brother (Option 1) is a first-degree relative, and recurrence risk for schizophrenia decreases with lower genetic relatedness. Empirical data confirm siblings have the highest risk among the listed options.  

**My final selection is: Option 1**
