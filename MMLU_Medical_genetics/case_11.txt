**1. Question Analysis**
- The question is inquiring about the specific subunit composition of normal adult hemoglobin (Hb A). It focuses on understanding the types of globin chains that assemble to form Hb A, a fundamental concept in medical genetics related to protein structure and gene expression.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**
- Hemoglobin is a tetrameric protein composed of globin chains. In adults, the predominant form of hemoglobin is Hb A.
- **Hb A Composition**: Consists of two alpha (α) chains and two beta (β) chains.
- **Fetal Hemoglobin (Hb F)**: Comprises two alpha (α) chains and two gamma (γ) chains.
- **Hb A2**: Contains two alpha (α) chains and two delta (δ) chains.
- The synthesis of different globin chains is regulated during development, with gamma chains being replaced by beta chains after birth, leading to the predominance of Hb A in adults.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Two α (alpha) and two β (beta) chains.**
   - **Correct**: This accurately describes the composition of normal adult hemoglobin (Hb A).
2. **Two α and two γ (gamma) chains.**
   - **Incorrect**: This is the composition of fetal hemoglobin (Hb F), not adult hemoglobin.
3. **Two α and two δ (delta) chains.**
   - **Incorrect**: This describes Hb A2, which is a minor component of adult hemoglobin.
4. **Four γ chains.**
   - **Incorrect**: Such a composition does not correspond to any standard form of hemoglobin and is not characteristic of adult hemoglobin.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks about the composition of normal adult hemoglobin (Hb A). This requires knowledge of globin chain types, their expression during different developmental stages, and the structural composition of hemoglobin in adults. Hemoglobin is a tetramer composed of two alpha-like and two beta-like globin chains, with specific combinations defining different hemoglobin variants (e.g., Hb A, Hb F, Hb A2).

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Globin Chain Types**: Humans have six globin genes divided into two clusters:  
  - **Alpha-like cluster** (chromosome 16): α-globin genes (duplicate α1 and α2).  
  - **Beta-like cluster** (chromosome 11): β-globin genes (ε, γG, γA, δ, β).  
- **Developmental Switching**: Fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) is γ2α2, while adult hemoglobin (Hb A) replaces γ chains with β chains. Minor adult hemoglobin variants include Hb A2 (δ2α2) and Hb Portland (ζ2ε2).  
- **Genetic Disorders**: Mutations in these genes cause disorders like sickle cell anemia (β-globin mutation) or α-thalassemia (α-globin deletion).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Two α and two β chains.  
  - **Correct**: This matches the definition of Hb A (α2β2), which constitutes ~95% of adult hemoglobin.  
- **Option 2**: Two α and two γ chains.  
  - **Incorrect**: γ chains are predominant in fetal hemoglobin (Hb F), not adults.  
- **Option 3**: Two α and two δ chains.  
  - **Incorrect**: δ chains form Hb A2 (α2δ2), a minor adult hemoglobin (~2–3%).  
- **Option 4**: Four γ chains.  
  - **Incorrect**: No physiologically significant hemoglobin in any life stage is composed of four γ chains.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks for the subunit composition of normal adult hemoglobin (Hb A), focusing on the specific globin chains (α, β, γ, δ) that form its structure. This requires knowledge of hemoglobin types and their developmental regulation.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- Hemoglobin is a tetramer composed of four globin chains.  
- **Hb A** (adult hemoglobin) is the predominant form in individuals after 6 months of age.  
- **Hb F** (fetal hemoglobin) consists of two α and two γ chains and is dominant during fetal development.  
- **Hb A2**, a minor adult hemoglobin (∼2-3% of total), contains two α and two δ chains.  
- Embryonic hemoglobins (e.g., Gower 1) involve ζ and ε chains but are irrelevant here.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (two α and two β chains):** Correct. Hb A is defined by the α₂β₂ structure.  
- **Option 2 (two α and two γ chains):** Incorrect. This describes Hb F, not Hb A.  
- **Option 3 (two α and two δ chains):** Incorrect. This corresponds to Hb A2, a minor adult hemoglobin.  
- **Option 4 (four γ chains):** Incorrect. Hemoglobin requires paired α-like and β-like chains; four γ chains do not form a functional adult hemoglobin.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**  
Hb A is unequivocally composed of two α and two β chains. This is a fundamental concept in hemoglobin biology, distinguishing Hb A from fetal (Hb F) and minor adult (Hb A2) forms.
