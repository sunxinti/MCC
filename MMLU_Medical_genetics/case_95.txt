**1. Question Analysis**
- The question seeks to identify which genetic disorder among the provided options can have its carriers detected using an enzyme assay.
- It focuses on understanding the application of enzyme assays in the context of carrier screening for specific genetic conditions.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**
- **Enzyme Assays**: These are biochemical tests that measure the activity levels of specific enzymes in cells or tissues. Reduced or abnormal enzyme activity can indicate the presence of certain genetic disorders.
- **Carrier Identification**: Detecting carriers involves identifying individuals who carry one copy of a recessive gene mutation but do not exhibit symptoms of the disorder. Enzyme assays can be particularly useful for disorders where the enzyme deficiency is a direct consequence of the genetic mutation.

**3. Analysis of Options**

1. **Cystic Fibrosis**
   - **Genetic Basis**: Caused by mutations in the CFTR gene.
   - **Detection Method**: Primarily identified through genetic testing (e.g., DNA analysis) and sweat chloride tests.
   - **Enzyme Assay Applicability**: Enzyme assays are not standard for carrier detection in cystic fibrosis.

2. **Fragile X Syndrome**
   - **Genetic Basis**: Caused by CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene.
   - **Detection Method**: Identified through genetic testing methodologies like PCR and Southern blotting.
   - **Enzyme Assay Applicability**: Enzyme assays are not used for detecting carriers of Fragile X syndrome.

3. **Oculocutaneous Albinism**
   - **Genetic Basis**: Involves mutations affecting melanin production, such as in the TYR gene encoding tyrosinase.
   - **Detection Method**: Primarily through genetic testing; however, certain types (e.g., Type 1) involve tyrosinase deficiency, which can be assessed via enzyme activity.
   - **Enzyme Assay Applicability**: While possible, enzyme assays are not the most common method for carrier screening in oculocutaneous albinism.

4. **Tay-Sachs Disease**
   - **Genetic Basis**: Caused by mutations in the HEXA gene leading to deficiency of the enzyme hexosaminidase A.
   - **Detection Method**: Enzyme assays measuring hexosaminidase A activity are standard for carrier screening, especially in high-risk populations like Ashkenazi Jews.
   - **Enzyme Assay Applicability**: Widely used and highly effective for identifying carriers of Tay-Sachs disease.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which genetic disorder allows identification of carriers through enzyme assays. This requires understanding the genetic basis of each disorder, their inheritance patterns, and the role of enzyme deficiencies in carrier detection. Enzyme assays measure enzyme activity and are typically used for disorders caused by recessive enzyme deficiencies, as carriers may have reduced but detectable enzyme levels.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Carrier Detection**: Carriers of autosomal recessive disorders have one functional allele, leading to partial enzyme activity. Enzyme assays can identify carriers if the disorder is caused by an enzyme deficiency.  
- **Inheritance Patterns**: Autosomal recessive disorders require two copies of a mutated gene for disease manifestation. Carriers are asymptomatic but can pass the mutation to offspring.  
- **Genetic Mechanisms**: Disorders caused by enzyme deficiencies (e.g., lysosomal storage diseases) are prime candidates for enzyme-based carrier screening.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Cystic Fibrosis**  
  - Caused by mutations in the *CFTR* gene, which encodes a chloride channel protein, not an enzyme.  
  - Carrier detection relies on genetic testing or sweat chloride tests, not enzyme assays.  
  - **Incorrect**.  

- **Option 2: Fragile X Syndrome**  
  - X-linked dominant disorder caused by expansion of CGG repeats in the *FMR1* gene, leading to methylation and silencing of the gene.  
  - The resulting deficiency is of the FMR1 protein (FMRP), which is not an enzyme.  
  - Carrier detection uses genetic testing (e.g., PCR, Southern blot).  
  - **Incorrect**.  

- **Option 3: Oculocutaneous Albinism**  
  - Often caused by mutations in the *TYR* gene, which encodes tyrosinase, an enzyme involved in melanin synthesis.  
  - While enzyme assays for tyrosinase activity in skin fibroblasts could theoretically detect carriers (heterozygotes with reduced enzyme levels), this method is not commonly used clinically. Genetic testing is preferred for carrier screening.  
  - **Incorrect** (not the best answer).  

- **Option 4: Tay-Sachs Disease**  
  - Autosomal recessive disorder caused by deficiency of hexosaminidase A, an enzyme critical for breaking down GM2 gangliosides.  
  - Carriers have reduced but detectable hexosaminidase A activity, making enzyme assays a standard method for carrier identification.  
  - Widely used in populations with high carrier frequencies (e.g., Ashkenazi Jews).  
  - **Correct**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which genetic disorder allows carrier identification through enzyme assays. This requires understanding of conditions where carriers (heterozygotes) exhibit measurable biochemical changes, specifically reduced enzyme activity, due to autosomal recessive inheritance.  

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Autosomal recessive disorders**: Carriers (heterozygotes) have one functional and one non-functional allele, often leading to partial enzyme activity.  
- **Enzyme assays**: Detect reduced enzyme levels in carriers, applicable only if the disorder involves an enzyme deficiency.  
- **Non-enzymatic proteins or non-recessive disorders**: Genetic testing (e.g., DNA sequencing) is typically used instead.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Cystic fibrosis)**: Caused by CFTR channel protein mutations, not an enzyme. Carriers are identified via DNA testing, not enzyme assays. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 2 (Fragile X syndrome)**: X-linked disorder caused by FMR1 gene expansion. Carrier status relies on genetic testing for repeat expansions, not enzyme activity. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 3 (Oculocutaneous albinism)**: Some forms involve tyrosinase deficiency (an enzyme), but carriers typically retain sufficient enzyme activity for normal pigmentation, making enzyme assays unreliable for carrier detection. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 4 (Tay-Sachs disease)**: Autosomal recessive disorder caused by hexosaminidase A deficiency. Carriers exhibit ~50% enzyme activity, detectable via enzyme assay. **Correct**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
Tay-Sachs disease is the only condition where enzyme assays reliably identify carriers due to measurable reductions in hexosaminidase A activity. Other options involve non-enzymatic proteins or require genetic testing.  

**My final selection is: Option 4**
