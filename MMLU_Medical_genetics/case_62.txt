**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is assessing the probability that an individual carries two specific alleles of a human DNA marker. It involves understanding allele frequencies within a population and calculating the likelihood of specific genotype combinations based on these frequencies.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Allele Frequency:** The frequency of an allele in a population is the proportion of all copies of that gene that is made up of a particular allele.
- **Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium:** This principle provides a framework to calculate genotype frequencies from allele frequencies in a population that is not evolving.
- **Genotype Probability Calculation:** For two specific alleles with frequencies \( p \) and \( q \), the probability of an individual being heterozygous (carrying both alleles) is given by \( 2pq \).

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (0.4):** This would imply a genotype frequency of \( 0.4 \), which is higher than what is expected with allele frequencies of 0.2 each.
- **Option 2 (0.32):** This does not align with the calculation under Hardy-Weinberg assumptions for two alleles with frequency 0.2 each.
- **Option 3 (0.08):** Calculated as \( 2 \times 0.2 \times 0.2 = 0.08 \), this accurately represents the probability of an individual being heterozygous for the two specific alleles.
- **Option 4 (0.02):** This is lower than the expected value based on the given allele frequencies.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks for the probability that an individual carries two specific alleles of a DNA marker, each with a frequency of 0.2.  
- This relates to population genetics principles, specifically allele and genotype frequencies under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.  

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Allele Frequency**: Each allele has a frequency of 0.2.  
- **Genotype Probability**: For a diploid organism, the probability of an individual having two specific alleles (one from each parent) depends on their allele frequencies.  
- **Hardy-Weinberg Principle**: The genotype frequency for heterozygotes (having two different alleles) at a locus is calculated as \(2 \times p \times q\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are the frequencies of the two alleles.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (0.4)**: Incorrect. This value represents the sum of the two allele frequencies (0.2 + 0.2). However, genotype frequencies are calculated using multiplication, not addition.  
- **Option 2 (0.32)**: Incorrect. This could result from \(0.8 \times 0.4\) or another arbitrary calculation but does not align with the heterozygote frequency formula.  
- **Option 3 (0.08)**: Correct. Using the heterozygote formula \(2 \times 0.2 \times 0.2 = 0.08\), this matches the expected probability of carrying both alleles.  
- **Option 4 (0.02)**: Incorrect. This is too low and would require an unrealistic scenario (e.g., \(0.1 \times 0.2\)), which is not supported by the given allele frequencies.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  
The correct probability is \(0.08\), derived from the heterozygote frequency formula \(2 \times p \times q\), where \(p = 0.2\) and \(q = 0.2\). This calculation assumes Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and that the two alleles are distinct (i.e., the individual is heterozygous for the two alleles).

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks for the probability that an individual carries two specific alleles of a DNA marker, each with a frequency of 0.2 in the population. This involves calculating genotype probabilities from allele frequencies, a core concept in population genetics.  

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Hardy-Weinberg Principle**: In a population at equilibrium, genotype frequencies are determined by the formula \( p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1 \), where \( p \) and \( q \) are allele frequencies.  
- **Homozygosity vs. Heterozygosity**:  
  - Homozygous genotype (e.g., \( AA \)) probability = \( p^2 \).  
  - Heterozygous genotype (e.g., \( Aa \)) probability = \( 2pq \).  
- Here, the question specifies *two specific alleles*, implying heterozygosity (individual carries both alleles, not two copies of the same allele).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (0.4)**: Incorrect. This represents the sum of the two allele frequencies (0.2 + 0.2), which does not correspond to any valid genotype probability.  
- **Option 2 (0.32)**: Incorrect. If misinterpreted as \( 2 \times p \times (1-p) \), but this assumes one allele is 0.2 and the other is 0.8 (total allele frequencies ≠ 1). Irrelevant here.  
- **Option 3 (0.08)**: Correct. For heterozygosity with two alleles each at frequency 0.2: \( 2 \times 0.2 \times 0.2 = 0.08 \).  
- **Option 4 (0.02)**: Incorrect. This would apply if the alleles were distinct and part of a multi-allelic system (e.g., two rare alleles among many), but the question specifies only two alleles.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The correct calculation uses the Hardy-Weinberg principle for heterozygosity. The probability of carrying both alleles is \( 2pq = 2 \times 0.2 \times 0.2 = 0.08 \).  

**My final selection is: Option 3**
