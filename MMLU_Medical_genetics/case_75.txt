**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is assessing the knowledge of genetic associations and characteristics of Hirschsprung disease (HSCR). It requires identifying which statement about HSCR is incorrect based on genetic concepts, inheritance patterns, and known genetic associations.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Hirschsprung Disease (HSCR):** A congenital disorder characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the intestine, leading to bowel obstruction.
- **Genetic Associations:**
  - **Down Syndrome:** HSCR is more common in individuals with Down syndrome.
  - **Sex Prevalence:** HSCR is more prevalent in males than in females.
  - **RET Gene:** The RET proto-oncogene is a major susceptibility gene for HSCR, playing a crucial role in the development of the enteric nervous system.
- **Inheritance Patterns:**
  - HSCR has a complex inheritance pattern with both sporadic and familial cases.
  - **Long Segment vs. Short Segment Disease:** Long segment HSCR is often associated with more significant genetic factors, potentially leading to higher recurrence risks compared to short segment disease.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1:** *It shows an association with Down syndrome.*  
  - **Evaluation:** Correct. HSCR is more frequently observed in individuals with Down syndrome.
  
- **Option 2:** *It is more common in girls than in boys.*  
  - **Evaluation:** **Incorrect.** HSCR is more common in males than in females, typically with a male-to-female ratio of approximately 4:1.
  
- **Option 3:** *RET is a major susceptibility gene.*  
  - **Evaluation:** Correct. Mutations in the RET gene are strongly associated with HSCR and are a major genetic factor.
  
- **Option 4:** *Recurrence risks are greater for long segment disease than for short segment disease.*  
  - **Evaluation:** Correct. Long segment HSCR is often linked to more significant genetic mutations, leading to higher recurrence risks in families.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks to identify the incorrect statement about Hirschsprung disease, a congenital disorder characterized by aganglionosis of the distal colon. Key genetic concepts include associated syndromes, sex distribution, genetic susceptibility genes, and recurrence risks based on disease severity.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Hirschsprung Disease Basics**: Caused by absence of enteric ganglion cells in the gut.  
- **Associated Syndromes**: Commonly linked to Down syndrome (trisomy 21), as well as other disorders like Waardenburg syndrome and neurofibromatosis.  
- **Sex Prevalence**: Males are affected approximately 4 times more often than females.  
- **Genetic Susceptibility**: The **RET** proto-oncogene (chromosome 10q11.2) is a major contributor, with mutations found in ~15-20% of sporadic cases and ~50% of familial cases.  
- **Recurrence Risk**: Familial cases (often long-segment disease) have higher recurrence risks due to germline mutations, while sporadic cases (short-segment disease) have lower recurrence risks.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Correct. Hirschsprung disease is indeed associated with Down syndrome, as trisomy 21 increases the risk.  
- **Option 2**: Incorrect. Hirschsprung disease is **more common in boys than girls**, with a male-to-female ratio of ~4:1. This statement reverses the sex distribution.  
- **Option 3**: Correct. **RET** is a well-established susceptibility gene, with mutations contributing significantly to both sporadic and familial cases.  
- **Option 4**: Correct. Long-segment disease often reflects germline mutations (e.g., in **RET**), leading to higher recurrence risks compared to short-segment disease, which is more often sporadic.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which statement about Hirschsprung disease is incorrect. This requires evaluating each option against established genetic and clinical features of Hirschsprung disease, including its associations, epidemiology, genetic contributors, and recurrence risks.  

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- Hirschsprung disease (congenital aganglionic megacolon) involves failure of neural crest cell migration to the distal colon, leading to aganglionic segments.  
- **Genetic associations**:  
  - Strong link to Down syndrome (trisomy 21).  
  - Major susceptibility gene: *RET* proto-oncogene (loss-of-function mutations).  
  - Other genes: *GDNF*, *EDNRB*, *SOX10*.  
- **Inheritance patterns**: Multifactorial (polygenic with environmental influences), but rare familial cases show autosomal dominant or recessive patterns.  
- **Epidemiology**: Male predominance (4:1 male-to-female ratio for short-segment disease).  
- **Recurrence risks**: Higher for long-segment disease (>10-15% for siblings) compared to short-segment (~3-5%).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Association with Down syndrome**: Correct. Trisomy 21 increases Hirschsprung disease risk (1-3% of Down syndrome cases).  
2. **More common in girls than boys**: Incorrect. Hirschsprung disease is 4 times more common in males, especially for short-segment disease.  
3. **RET as a major susceptibility gene**: Correct. *RET* mutations account for ~50% of familial cases and 15-20% of sporadic cases.  
4. **Higher recurrence risks for long-segment disease**: Correct. Long-segment disease reflects greater genetic liability, leading to higher recurrence risks.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The incorrect statement is **Option 2**, as Hirschsprung disease exhibits a strong male predominance.  

**My final selection is: Option 2**
