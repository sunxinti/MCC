**1. Question Analysis**
- The question is inquiring about the specific type of genetic mutation responsible for sickle-cell disease.
- It focuses on understanding the nature of the genetic alteration at the molecular level that leads to this particular genetic disorder.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**
- Sickle-cell disease is a hereditary blood disorder caused by mutations in the HBB gene, which encodes the beta-globin subunit of hemoglobin.
- The disorder follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.
- The mutation involved is a single nucleotide change resulting in the substitution of one amino acid for another in the hemoglobin protein, leading to the characteristic sickling of red blood cells.
- Specifically, the mutation is a missense mutation where adenine is replaced by thymine in the DNA sequence, altering the amino acid from glutamic acid to valine at the sixth position of the beta-globin chain.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **a deletion.**
   - Incorrect. A deletion involves the loss of a segment of DNA, which is not the case in sickle-cell disease.
2. **a duplication.**
   - Incorrect. Duplication refers to the addition of an extra copy of a DNA segment, which does not occur in sickle-cell disease.
3. **an insertion.**
   - Incorrect. An insertion involves adding extra nucleotides into the DNA sequence, which is not the mechanism in sickle-cell disease.
4. **a point mutation.**
   - Correct. Sickle-cell disease is caused by a point mutation, specifically a single nucleotide substitution in the HBB gene.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks about the type of mutation responsible for sickle-cell disease.  
- It requires knowledge of genetic mutation types (deletion, duplication, insertion, point mutation) and their association with specific disorders.  

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- Sickle-cell disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation in the **HBB gene** (encodes beta-globin subunit of hemoglobin).  
- The mutation results in a single amino acid substitution (valine replaces glutamic acid at position 6 of the beta-globin chain).  
- This substitution is caused by a **single nucleotide change** (A→T at codon 6), which is a classic example of a **point mutation** (specifically a missense mutation).  
- Point mutations involve a change in a single nucleotide pair, whereas deletions, duplications, or insertions involve the loss, duplication, or addition of nucleotides, respectively.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (deletion):** Incorrect. A deletion involves the loss of nucleotides. The sickle-cell mutation does not involve deletion but a substitution.  
- **Option 2 (duplication):** Incorrect. Duplication refers to the repetition of a nucleotide segment, which is not involved in sickle-cell disease.  
- **Option 3 (insertion):** Incorrect. Insertion involves adding nucleotides, which would likely cause a frameshift mutation. The sickle-cell mutation is a point substitution, not an insertion.  
- **Option 4 (point mutation):** Correct. The sickle-cell mutation is a single nucleotide substitution (A→T), which is a point mutation (missense type).  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks for the type of genetic mutation responsible for sickle-cell disease. This requires understanding the molecular basis of the disorder and differentiating between mutation types (e.g., deletions, duplications, insertions, point mutations).  

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- Sickle-cell disease is caused by a mutation in the *HBB* gene, which encodes the β-globin subunit of hemoglobin.  
- The mutation results in a single nucleotide substitution (a **point mutation**) in codon 6 of the *HBB* gene, where adenine (A) is replaced by thymine (T). This changes the mRNA codon from GAG (glutamic acid) to GUG (valine), producing abnormal hemoglobin S (HbS).  
- Point mutations involve substitution of one nucleotide without altering the reading frame, unlike deletions, duplications, or insertions, which involve loss, gain, or addition of nucleotides.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Deletion):** Incorrect. A deletion would remove nucleotides, potentially causing a frameshift or truncation. This is not observed in sickle-cell disease.  
- **Option 2 (Duplication):** Incorrect. Duplications involve copying a segment of DNA, which is unrelated to the single nucleotide change in sickle-cell disease.  
- **Option 3 (Insertion):** Incorrect. Insertions add nucleotides, which would alter the reading frame if not in multiples of three. The *HBB* gene mutation does not involve added nucleotides.  
- **Option 4 (Point Mutation):** Correct. The substitution of a single nucleotide (A to T) in the *HBB* gene is a classic point mutation, directly causing the amino acid change responsible for HbS.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The mutation in sickle-cell disease is a **point mutation** (Option 4), as it involves a single nucleotide substitution that alters the β-globin protein structure.  

**My final selection is: Option 4**
