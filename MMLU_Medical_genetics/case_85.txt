================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question is asking for a term that describes the entire set of observable characteristics in an organism, considering both genetic and environmental factors. This involves understanding key genetic concepts related to how traits are expressed and the distinction between genetic makeup and physical manifestation.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Genotype** refers to the specific genetic makeup of an organism, encompassing all of its genes and alleles. It represents the inherited instructions for building and maintaining the organism.
- **Phenotype** is the observable set of characteristics or traits of an organism, such as morphology, development, biochemical properties, and behavior. Phenotype results from the interaction of the genotype with the environment.
- The relationship between genotype and phenotype is fundamental in genetics, illustrating how genetic information is expressed physically and how environmental factors can influence this expression.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Genotype**  
   - *Incorrect.* While genotype is a crucial part of an organism's makeup, it solely refers to the genetic blueprint without accounting for environmental influences.
  
2. **Phenotype**  
   - *Correct.* Phenotype encompasses all observable characteristics and results from the combined effects of an organism's genotype and environmental factors.
  
3. **Both genotype and phenotype**  
   - *Incorrect.* The question seeks a single term that includes both genetic and environmental effects on observable traits. While phenotype inherently includes both, combining the two terms is redundant and not standard terminology.
  
4. **Neither genotype nor phenotype**  
   - *Incorrect.* This option dismisses both relevant terms, which does not align with established genetic concepts.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks for the term that describes observable characteristics resulting from both genetic and environmental influences. This requires understanding the distinction between genetic makeup (genotype) and observable traits (phenotype).

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Genotype**: Refers to the genetic constitution of an organism, i.e., the specific alleles or genes present in its DNA. It does not account for environmental influences.  
- **Phenotype**: Refers to the observable traits or characteristics of an organism, such as physical appearance, biochemical properties, or behaviors. These traits arise from the interaction between the genotype and environmental factors.  
- **Genetic Mechanisms**: Phenotypic traits are determined by gene expression, which can be modulated by environmental factors (e.g., nutrition, temperature, exposure to toxins).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (genotype)**: Incorrect. The genotype is the genetic code itself, not the observable traits. It does not incorporate environmental effects.  
- **Option 2 (phenotype)**: Correct. The phenotype explicitly includes all observable characteristics and is shaped by both genetic and environmental factors.  
- **Option 3 (both genotype and phenotype)**: Incorrect. While genotype and phenotype are related, the question asks for the term that directly describes the sum of genetic and environmental effects. The phenotype alone captures this.  
- **Option 4 (neither genotype or phenotype)**: Incorrect. The phenotype is the established term for observable characteristics influenced by both factors.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks for the term describing observable characteristics resulting from genetic and environmental influences.  
- Focuses on distinguishing between genetic concepts (genotype vs. phenotype) and their relationship to observable traits.  

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Genotype**: An organism’s genetic makeup (alleles inherited). It does not directly describe observable traits.  
- **Phenotype**: Observable physical, biochemical, or behavioral traits (e.g., height, eye color). Arises from interactions between genotype and environmental factors (e.g., nutrition, exposure).  
- Environmental effects can modify phenotypes even with identical genotypes (e.g., monozygotic twins differing due to lifestyle).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (genotype)**: Incorrect. Genotype refers to genetic information alone, not observable traits or environmental influences.  
- **Option 2 (phenotype)**: Correct. Phenotype encompasses observable characteristics shaped by both genetic and environmental factors.  
- **Option 3 (both genotype and phenotype)**: Incorrect. The question seeks a single term, not a combination.  
- **Option 4 (neither)**: Incorrect. Phenotype explicitly matches the definition provided.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  
The phenotype is the sum of observable traits influenced by genetics and environment, aligning precisely with the question’s description. Genotype alone lacks environmental contributions, making Option 2 the only valid choice.
