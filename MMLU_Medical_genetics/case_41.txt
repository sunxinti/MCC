**1. Question Analysis**
- The question is assessing the understanding of the relationship between the incidence of an X-linked recessive disorder in males and the expected incidence in homozygous females under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium conditions.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**
- **X-Linked Recessive Inheritance**: Such disorders are carried on the X chromosome. Males (XY) are hemizygous, so the incidence in males directly reflects the allele frequency (q) of the recessive trait. Females (XX) must inherit two copies of the recessive allele to express the disorder.
- **Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium**: Assumes no mutation, selection, or genetic drift, and random mating. Under these conditions, allele and genotype frequencies remain constant.
- **Calculations**:
  - **Allele Frequency (q)**: For males, incidence = q. Given incidence in males is 1/100, so q = 0.01.
  - **Genotype Frequency in Females**: For homozygous females, frequency = q² = (0.01)² = 0.0001 = 1/10,000.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **1 in 1000**: This would imply a q² of 1/1,000 (0.001), which is higher than the calculated 0.0001.
2. **1 in 4000**: This implies a q² of 1/4,000 (0.00025), still higher than 0.0001.
3. **1 in 10,000**: This matches the calculated q² of 0.0001.
4. **1 in 40,000**: This would imply a q² of 1/40,000 (0.000025), which is lower than the calculated value.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks for the expected incidence of affected homozygous females for an X-linked recessive disorder when the incidence in males is 1 in 100. This requires understanding X-linked recessive inheritance and the application of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium principles to calculate allele frequencies and genotype frequencies in females.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **X-linked recessive inheritance**: Males (hemizygous for the X chromosome) are affected if they inherit the recessive allele (frequency = q). Females require two copies of the recessive allele (homozygous, frequency = q²) to be affected.  
- **Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium**: For X-linked traits, the frequency of the recessive allele (q) in males directly equals the incidence of affected males. For females, the homozygous recessive genotype frequency (q²) is calculated as the square of the allele frequency.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (1 in 1000)**: Incorrect. This would imply q = 0.001, but the male incidence is given as 1/100 (q = 0.01).  
- **Option 2 (1 in 4000)**: Incorrect. This suggests an incorrect application of Hardy-Weinberg (e.g., using 2pq instead of q² or introducing a factor like population sex ratio).  
- **Option 3 (1 in 10 000)**: Correct. Since q (allele frequency) = 0.01 (from male incidence), q² = (0.01)² = 0.0001, which equals 1 in 10,000.  
- **Option 4 (1 in 40 000)**: Incorrect. This would imply an incorrect calculation such as (q²)/4 or another unnecessary adjustment.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  

The incidence in males (1 in 100) directly gives the recessive allele frequency (q = 0.01). The homozygous recessive female frequency is q² = (0.01)² = 0.0001, corresponding to 1 in 10,000. This matches Option 3.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks for the expected incidence of homozygous females affected by an X-linked recessive disorder under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, given that the male incidence is 1 in 100. This requires calculating allele frequencies and applying X-linked inheritance principles.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **X-linked recessive inheritance**: Males are hemizygous (one X), so their disease incidence equals the allele frequency \( q \). Females require two copies (\( q^2 \)) to be affected.  
- **Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium**: For X-linked traits, female genotype frequencies follow \( p^2 \) (normal), \( 2pq \) (carrier), and \( q^2 \) (affected).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (1 in 1000)**: Incorrect. This would correspond to \( q = 0.0316 \), inconsistent with the given male incidence (\( q = 0.01 \)).  
- **Option 2 (1 in 4000)**: Incorrect. This implies \( q = 0.016 \), which does not align with \( q = 0.01 \).  
- **Option 3 (1 in 10,000)**: Correct. \( q = 0.01 \), so \( q^2 = 0.0001 = 1/10,000 \), matching the expected frequency of affected females.  
- **Option 4 (1 in 40,000)**: Incorrect. This would require \( q = 0.005 \), inconsistent with the male incidence of 1/100.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The correct calculation uses \( q = 0.01 \) (male incidence) to determine \( q^2 = 1/10,000 \) for homozygous females.  

**My final selection is: Option 3**
