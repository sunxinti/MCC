**1. Question Analysis**
- The question is inquiring about the genetic basis of DiGeorge/Shprintzen syndrome, specifically identifying which chromosome undergoes a deletion that leads to the disorder. This requires knowledge of chromosomal abnormalities associated with specific genetic syndromes.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**
- **DiGeorge Syndrome**: Also known as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, it is caused by a microdeletion on the long arm of chromosome 22 at position 11.2. This deletion affects multiple genes, leading to various clinical features such as cardiac defects, immune deficiencies, palate abnormalities, and developmental delays.
- **Shprintzen Syndrome**: Likely referring to Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome, which is distinct from DiGeorge syndrome and involves mutations in the SKI gene on chromosome 1. However, the context of the question suggests a focus on DiGeorge syndrome.
- Understanding chromosomal nomenclature is essential, where chromosomes are numbered 1 through 22 (autosomes) and the sex chromosomes (X and Y).

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Chromosome 4**
   - Associated with disorders like Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (4p deletion) and certain cases of cleft palate, but not DiGeorge syndrome.
2. **Chromosome 7**
   - Linked to conditions such as Williams syndrome (7q11.23 deletion) and cystic fibrosis (mutation in CFTR gene), not DiGeorge syndrome.
3. **Chromosome 15**
   - Involved in Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes (15q deletions or mutations), unrelated to DiGeorge syndrome.
4. **Chromosome 22**
   - Specifically associated with DiGeorge syndrome through the 22q11.2 microdeletion.

**4. Final Selection**
- **My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks for the chromosome involved in DiGeorge/Shprintzen syndrome due to a deletion. This requires knowledge of specific genetic disorders caused by chromosomal deletions and their associated loci.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- DiGeorge/Shprintzen syndrome is a congenital disorder characterized by hypocalcemia, cardiac defects, facial dysmorphism, and immune deficiency.  
- The most common cause is a **microdeletion** in the **22q11.2** region of chromosome 22. This deletion disrupts genes critical for embryonic development, including *TBX1*, which is strongly associated with the syndrome’s phenotypic features.  
- The deletion is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern but often arises de novo.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Chromosome 4):** Incorrect. Chromosome 4 deletions are associated with rare disorders like Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (4p deletion) but not DiGeorge/Shprintzen syndrome.  
- **Option 2 (Chromosome 7):** Incorrect. Chromosome 7 deletions are linked to conditions like Williams-Beuren syndrome (which involves chromosome 7 duplications/deletions of *ELN*), but not DiGeorge syndrome.  
- **Option 3 (Chromosome 15):** Incorrect. Chromosome 15q11-q13 deletions cause Prader-Willi or Angelman syndromes, which are distinct from DiGeorge/Shprintzen syndrome.  
- **Option 4 (Chromosome 22):** Correct. The 22q11.2 deletion is the hallmark genetic cause of DiGeorge/Shprintzen syndrome.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  
The deletion in DiGeorge/Shprintzen syndrome is well-established to occur on chromosome 22 at the 22q11.2 locus. This is a textbook example of a microdeletion syndrome, and no other chromosome is associated with this specific condition.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks for the chromosome affected by a deletion in DiGeorge/Shprintzen syndrome, a genetic disorder. This requires knowledge of chromosomal aberrations and their association with specific syndromes.  

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- DiGeorge/Shprintzen syndrome (also called 22q11.2 deletion syndrome) is caused by a heterozygous deletion at chromosome 22q11.2.  
- This deletion disrupts genes critical for embryonic development of the pharyngeal arches, leading to thymic, parathyroid, cardiac, and craniofacial abnormalities.  
- It is the most common microdeletion syndrome in humans and follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, though most cases arise de novo.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (4):** Chromosome 4 deletions are linked to Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (4p16.3), unrelated to DiGeorge. **Incorrect.**  
- **Option 2 (7):** Chromosome 7 deletions (e.g., 7q11.23) cause Williams syndrome, characterized by cardiovascular and neurodevelopmental features distinct from DiGeorge. **Incorrect.**  
- **Option 3 (15):** Chromosome 15 deletions (e.g., 15q11-13) are associated with Prader-Willi or Angelman syndromes. **Incorrect.**  
- **Option 4 (22):** Chromosome 22q11.2 deletions are the definitive cause of DiGeorge/Shprintzen syndrome. **Correct.**  

**4. Final Selection**  
The deletion in DiGeorge/Shprintzen syndrome occurs at chromosome 22q11.2, making **Option 4** the only accurate answer.  

**My final selection is: Option 4**
