**1. Question Analysis**  
The question is assessing knowledge of the genetic mechanisms underlying Angelman syndrome, a neurogenetic disorder. It requires understanding of concepts such as uniparental disomy (UPD), chromosomal deletions, and gene mutations, particularly in the context of genomic imprinting and parent-of-origin effects on gene expression.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
Angelman syndrome is primarily caused by the loss of function of the UBE3A gene on the maternal chromosome 15q11-q13 region. Several genetic mechanisms can lead to this loss of function:
- **Deletion of the maternal chromosome 15q11-q13**: Results in the absence of the maternal UBE3A gene.
- **Paternal uniparental disomy (UPD) of chromosome 15**: Both copies of chromosome 15 are inherited from the father, leading to no maternal UBE3A expression.
- **Imprinting defects or mutations in the UBE3A gene**: These disrupt the normal expression of the maternal UBE3A gene.

Genomic imprinting is crucial here, as certain genes are expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific manner. In Angelman syndrome, the critical issue is the lack of active maternal UBE3A gene expression in the brain.

**3. Analysis of Options**

1. **Maternal UPD 15**  
   - *Incorrect.* Maternal UPD 15 means both chromosome 15 copies are from the mother. This scenario is more commonly associated with Prader-Willi syndrome if the paternal genes are not expressed, but for Angelman syndrome, paternal UPD is relevant.
   
2. **Paternal UPD 15**  
   - *Correct.* Paternal UPD 15 involves inheriting both chromosome 15 copies from the father, resulting in no active maternal UBE3A gene expression, which leads to Angelman syndrome.
   
3. **Deletion in the paternally derived chromosome 15**  
   - *Incorrect.* A deletion in the paternal chromosome 15q11-q13 is associated with Prader-Willi syndrome, not Angelman syndrome.
   
4. **A mutation in the SNRPN promoter**  
   - *Incorrect.* Mutations in the SNRPN gene are linked to Prader-Willi syndrome, as SNRPN is a paternally expressed gene. Angelman syndrome involves mutations in the maternal UBE3A gene.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks about the genetic mechanism leading to Angelman syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder. Key considerations include genomic imprinting, chromosomal deletions, uniparental disomy (UPD), and mutations in specific genes. Angelman syndrome is associated with the loss of function of the maternally expressed UBE3A gene in the 15q11-q13 region.  

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Genomic Imprinting**: The 15q11-q13 region exhibits parent-of-origin-specific expression. Angelman syndrome results from loss of the maternal contribution of this region, while Prader-Willi syndrome results from loss of the paternal contribution.  
- **Mechanisms Leading to Angelman Syndrome**:  
  1. **Deletion of the maternal 15q11-q13 region** (common cause).  
  2. **Paternal UPD 15**: Both copies of chromosome 15 are paternal, leading to loss of maternal UBE3A.  
  3. **Imprinting defect** (e.g., mutations in the imprinting center) silencing the maternal allele.  
  4. **UBE3A mutation** on the maternal chromosome.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Maternal UPD 15)**: Results in **Prader-Willi syndrome**, not Angelman. Maternal UPD provides two copies of the maternal chromosome 15, which includes the functional maternal UBE3A allele. However, the paternal-derived genes (e.g., SNORD116) required for Prader-Willi are absent. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 2 (Paternal UPD 15)**: Provides two paternal copies of chromosome 15. This eliminates the maternal UBE3A allele, and the paternal UBE3A allele is imprinted and inactive in the brain. This directly causes Angelman syndrome. **Correct**.  
- **Option 3 (Deletion in paternally derived chromosome 15)**: A deletion on the paternal chromosome 15 would cause **Prader-Willi syndrome**, as it removes the paternal genes required for normal development. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 4 (Mutation in the SNRPN promoter)**: SNRPN is a paternally expressed gene involved in Prader-Willi syndrome. Mutations here would more likely affect Prader-Willi or disrupt imprinting in a way unrelated to Angelman. **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  

Angelman syndrome arises from loss of the maternal contribution of the 15q11-q13 region. Paternal UPD 15 eliminates the maternal UBE3A allele, leaving only the imprinted (non-functional) paternal allele. This matches the genetic basis of Angelman syndrome, making **Option 2** the correct answer.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which genetic mechanism results in Angelman syndrome (AS), focusing on chromosome 15 abnormalities, imprinting, and inheritance patterns. Understanding the distinction between AS and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and their respective genetic causes is critical.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Angelman syndrome** is caused by the loss of *maternally* derived gene expression in the 15q11-q13 region, specifically the *UBE3A* gene, which is imprinted (maternally active in the brain).  
- **Prader-Willi syndrome** results from the loss of *paternally* derived gene expression in the same region (e.g., *SNRPN*).  
- Mechanisms for AS include:  
  - Maternal 15q11-q13 deletion (most common).  
  - **Paternal uniparental disomy (UPD 15)** (two paternal copies, no maternal *UBE3A*).  
  - Imprinting defects or *UBE3A* mutations.  
- UPD refers to inheriting two copies of a chromosome from one parent and none from the other.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Maternal UPD 15**  
  Maternal UPD 15 results in two maternal copies of chromosome 15. Since *UBE3A* is maternally active, this would not cause AS. Instead, maternal UPD 15 leads to **PWS** (lack of paternal genes). **Incorrect**.  

- **Option 2: Paternal UPD 15**  
  Paternal UPD 15 means two paternal copies and no maternal contribution. The paternal *UBE3A* is silenced in the brain, leading to a complete lack of active *UBE3A* and causing AS. **Correct**.  

- **Option 3: Deletion in the paternally derived chromosome 15**  
  A paternal deletion does not affect AS, as *UBE3A* is maternally expressed. This mechanism would cause **PWS** (loss of paternal genes like *SNRPN*). **Incorrect**.  

- **Option 4: Mutation in the SNRPN promoter**  
  *SNRPN* is paternally expressed and associated with PWS. A promoter mutation would disrupt *SNRPN* expression, leading to PWS, not AS. **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  
Paternal UPD 15 directly results in Angelman syndrome by eliminating the maternal contribution of *UBE3A*, which is critical for normal neurological function. This aligns with the genetic mechanisms and imprinting patterns specific to AS.
