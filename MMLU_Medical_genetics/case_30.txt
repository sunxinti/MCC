**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is inquiring about the specific type of genetic mutation responsible for δβ-thalassaemia. It requires understanding the underlying genetic mechanisms that lead to this particular form of thalassaemia, focusing on the type of mutation (deletion, duplication, insertion, or point mutation) involved in its pathogenesis.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **δβ-Thalassaemia** is a form of thalassaemia characterized by reduced or absent production of both delta and beta globin chains. It is typically caused by genetic mutations that disrupt the production of these globin chains.
- **Genetic Mutations**:
  - **Deletion**: Removal of a segment of DNA, which can result in the loss of one or more genes.
  - **Duplication**: An extra copy of a DNA segment, leading to increased gene dosage.
  - **Insertion**: Addition of extra nucleotides into the DNA sequence.
  - **Point Mutation**: A change in a single nucleotide base in the DNA.
- In the context of δβ-thalassaemia, large deletions affecting the δ and β globin gene clusters are commonly implicated, leading to the absence of these globin chains.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: a deletion.**  
  - **Correct.** δβ-Thalassaemia is most often caused by large deletions that remove both delta and beta globin genes, disrupting their production.
- **Option 2: a duplication.**  
  - **Incorrect.** Duplication mutations typically result in the duplication of gene segments, which is not the primary mechanism in δβ-thalassaemia.
- **Option 3: an insertion.**  
  - **Incorrect.** Insertions involve adding nucleotides into the DNA sequence, which is not the common mutation type associated with δβ-thalassaemia.
- **Option 4: a point mutation.**  
  - **Incorrect.** While point mutations are a common mechanism in other forms of thalassaemia (like β-thalassaemia), δβ-thalassaemia is primarily caused by larger deletions rather than single nucleotide changes.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks about the mutational mechanism underlying δβ-thalassaemia, a subtype of thalassaemia. It requires knowledge of genetic mutations affecting globin genes and their classification (deletion, duplication, insertion, point mutation).

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **δβ-Thalassaemia** is a form of beta-thalassaemia where mutations disrupt both the **delta (δ)** and **beta (β) globin genes**. These genes are adjacent on chromosome 11.  
- **Thalassaemias** are typically caused by mutations impairing globin chain synthesis. Beta-thalassaemia arises from mutations in the **HBB gene** (β-globin), while δβ-thalassaemia involves defects in both HBD (δ-globin) and HBB.  
- **Mutation types**:  
  - **Deletions** can remove large segments of DNA, potentially encompassing entire genes (e.g., a deletion spanning both δ and β genes).  
  - **Point mutations** (e.g., single nucleotide changes) are common in beta-thalassaemia but usually affect only the β-globin gene.  
  - **Duplications/insertions** are less commonly associated with δβ-thalassaemia.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Deletion):**  
  - **Correct**. δβ-thalassaemia is frequently caused by **deletions** that remove portions of both the δ- and β-globin genes. A well-known example is the "Tibetan" deletion, which spans both genes, leading to reduced or absent production of both δ- and β-globin chains.  
- **Option 2 (Duplication):**  
  - **Incorrect**. Duplication of globin genes is rare in δβ-thalassaemia and would likely result in increased, not decreased, globin production.  
- **Option 3 (Insertion):**  
  - **Incorrect**. Insertions can disrupt gene function but are not the primary mechanism for δβ-thalassaemia.  
- **Option 4 (Point mutation):**  
  - **Incorrect**. Point mutations typically affect only a single nucleotide and are more commonly associated with classic beta-thalassaemia (not δβ-thalassaemia), which specifically involves both δ and β genes.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**  

δβ-thalassaemia is primarily caused by **deletions** that remove regions of the chromosome containing both the δ- and β-globin genes. This mechanism directly explains the combined disruption of both genes, distinguishing it from point mutations, which are limited to single nucleotide changes and typically affect only the β-globin gene in standard beta-thalassaemia.

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks for the mutational mechanism underlying δβ-thalassemia, focusing on the genetic alteration (deletion, duplication, insertion, or point mutation) responsible for this disorder.  

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- δβ-thalassemia is characterized by reduced or absent synthesis of both δ- and β-globin chains due to mutations in the β-globin gene cluster (HBB locus on chromosome 11).  
- The disorder often involves large deletions that remove both the δ- (HBD) and β-globin (HBB) genes, leaving the γ-globin (HBG) genes intact. This results in compensatory persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HbF, α2γ2) postnatally.  
- Deletions in the β-globin cluster are a well-documented cause of δβ-thalassemia, while point mutations typically underlie β-thalassemia (affecting β-globin alone).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (deletion):** Correct. Large deletions encompassing both δ- and β-globin genes are the hallmark of δβ-thalassemia. These deletions abolish δ- and β-chain synthesis but spare γ-globin, leading to elevated HbF.  
- **Option 2 (duplication):** Incorrect. Duplications in the HBB locus are not associated with thalassemia phenotypes.  
- **Option 3 (insertion):** Incorrect. Insertions disrupting δ- and β-globin genes are rare in thalassemia; they typically cause frameshift mutations in single genes (e.g., β-thalassemia).  
- **Option 4 (point mutation):** Incorrect. Point mutations primarily cause β- or δ-thalassemia in isolation, not combined δβ-thalassemia.  

**4. Final Selection**  
- The mutational mechanism in δβ-thalassemia is most accurately explained by a deletion removing the δ- and β-globin genes, consistent with the genetic basis of this disorder.  

**My final selection is: Option 1**
