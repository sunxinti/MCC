**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is inquiring about the specific phase of meiosis during which genetic recombination occurs. Recombination is a critical process that increases genetic diversity by exchanging genetic material between homologous chromosomes.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Meiosis Phases:** Meiosis consists of two main divisions: Meiosis I and Meiosis II, each with prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase stages.
- **Recombination (Crossing-Over):** This process occurs during Prophase I of Meiosis I, specifically in the pachytene stage. It involves the exchange of genetic material between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes, leading to genetic variation in gametes.
- **Significance:** Recombination is essential for ensuring genetic diversity and proper segregation of chromosomes.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Metaphase I:**  
   - **Incorrect.** During Metaphase I, homologous chromosomes align at the metaphase plate, but recombination (crossing-over) has already occurred in the preceding Prophase I.
2. **Prophase I:**  
   - **Correct.** Recombination occurs in Prophase I, particularly during the pachytene stage, where homologous chromosomes pair and exchange genetic material.
3. **Metaphase II:**  
   - **Incorrect.** Metaphase II involves the alignment of sister chromatids at the metaphase plate in the second meiotic division, with no recombination occurring at this stage.
4. **Prophase II:**  
   - **Incorrect.** Prophase II is the initial phase of the second meiotic division and does not involve recombination.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks about the stage of meiosis during which recombination (crossing over) occurs.  
- Key concepts involve understanding the phases of meiosis and the timing of genetic recombination.  

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Recombination**: Occurs via crossing over between homologous chromosomes, exchanging genetic material. This process is critical for genetic diversity.  
- **Meiosis Phases**:  
  - **Prophase I**: Includes stages like leptotene, zygotene, pachytene, diplotene, and diakinesis. Crossing over occurs during **pachytene**, when homologous chromosomes form a tetrad and are held together by the synaptonemal complex.  
  - **Metaphase I**: Homologous pairs align at the metaphase plate but do not exchange DNA.  
  - **Meiosis II**: Resembles mitosis, with sister chromatids separating; no recombination occurs here.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Metaphase I)**: Incorrect. Metaphase I involves alignment of homologous pairs at the metaphase plate but does not involve genetic recombination.  
- **Option 2 (Prophase I)**: Correct. Recombination/crossing over occurs during prophase I, specifically the pachytene stage.  
- **Option 3 (Metaphase II)**: Incorrect. Metaphase II involves sister chromatids aligning, not homologous chromosomes, and no recombination occurs here.  
- **Option 4 (Prophase II)**: Incorrect. Prophase II is brief and occurs after homologous chromosomes have already separated in anaphase I; recombination is impossible at this stage.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks during which phase of meiosis recombination (crossing over) occurs. This requires understanding the stages of meiosis and the specific phase where genetic recombination takes place.  

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- Recombination involves the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes, creating genetic diversity.  
- In meiosis, this process occurs during **Prophase I** when homologous chromosomes pair (synapsis) and form chiasmata, enabling crossover events.  
- Meiosis II involves the separation of sister chromatids and does not include homologous chromosome pairing, so recombination cannot occur in Prophase II or subsequent phases.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Metaphase I):** Incorrect. Metaphase I involves the alignment of homologous chromosomes at the metaphase plate, occurring after recombination in Prophase I.  
- **Option 2 (Prophase I):** Correct. Recombination occurs during this phase due to homologous chromosome pairing and chiasmata formation.  
- **Option 3 (Metaphase II):** Incorrect. Metaphase II aligns sister chromatids, not homologous chromosomes, and recombination has already concluded.  
- **Option 4 (Prophase II):** Incorrect. Prophase II involves preparing sister chromatids for separation; no homologous chromosomes are present to recombine.  

**4. Final Selection**  
- Recombination is a defining event of Prophase I, making **Option 2** the only accurate answer.  

**My final selection is: Option 2**
