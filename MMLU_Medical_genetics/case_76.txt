**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is assessing knowledge of genetic disorders specifically caused by trinucleotide (triplet) repeat expansions. It requires identifying which condition among the listed options is associated with this type of genetic mutation.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Trinucleotide Repeat Expansion:** This genetic mechanism involves the abnormal repetition of a sequence of three nucleotides within a gene. When the number of repeats exceeds a normal threshold, it can disrupt the function of the gene, leading to disease.
- **Inheritance Patterns:** Diseases caused by trinucleotide repeat expansions often show anticipation, where symptoms become more severe or appear at an earlier age in successive generations.
- **Associated Disorders:** Conditions such as Huntington disease, myotonic dystrophy, and Fragile X syndrome are classic examples of disorders caused by trinucleotide repeat expansions.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Cystic Fibrosis**  
   - *Genetic Basis:* Caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, most commonly the ΔF508 deletion.  
   - *Evaluation:* Incorrect. It is not caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion.
   
2. **Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy**  
   - *Genetic Basis:* Caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, typically large deletions or frame-shift mutations.  
   - *Evaluation:* Incorrect. It is not associated with trinucleotide repeat expansions.
   
3. **Huntington Disease**  
   - *Genetic Basis:* Caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the HTT gene.  
   - *Evaluation:* Correct. It is a classic example of a disorder caused by trinucleotide repeat expansion.
   
4. **Osteogenesis Imperfecta**  
   - *Genetic Basis:* Caused by mutations in collagen genes (e.g., COL1A1, COL1A2), often missense or nonsense mutations.  
   - *Evaluation:* Incorrect. It is not caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks which condition is caused by a trinucleotide (triplet) repeat expansion, a type of genetic mutation where a sequence of three nucleotides is abnormally repeated many times. This mechanism is linked to specific neurodegenerative and neuromuscular disorders.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Trinucleotide Repeat Disorders**: These involve unstable expansions of triplet sequences (e.g., CAG, CTG, CGG) in genes. The expanded repeats interfere with gene function, often leading to protein aggregation or RNA toxicity. Examples include Huntington disease (CAG repeats in HTT), Fragile X syndrome (CGG repeats in FMR1), and myotonic dystrophy (CTG repeats in DMPK).  
- **Inheritance**: These disorders typically follow an autosomal dominant pattern, though some may show anticipation (increased severity with each generation due to further repeat expansion).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Cystic fibrosis**  
  - Caused by mutations in the *CFTR* gene, most commonly a 3-nucleotide deletion (ΔF508) leading to dysfunctional chloride channels. **Not a triplet repeat expansion.**  

- **Option 2: Duchenne muscular dystrophy**  
  - Results from large deletions or duplications in the *DMD* gene, disrupting dystrophin protein synthesis. **Not a triplet repeat expansion.**  

- **Option 3: Huntington disease**  
  - Caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the *HTT* gene (exon 1). Normal alleles have 10–35 repeats, while pathogenic alleles exceed 39 repeats, leading to a polyglutamine expansion and neurodegeneration. **This is a classic example of a triplet repeat disorder.**  

- **Option 4: Osteogenesis imperfecta**  
  - Caused by mutations in *COL1A1* or *COL1A2*, typically point mutations or small insertions/deletions that impair collagen synthesis. **Not a triplet repeat expansion.**  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question requires identifying a genetic disorder caused by a trinucleotide (triplet) repeat expansion.  
- Key concept: Disorders caused by dynamic mutations involving unstable DNA sequences (e.g., CAG, CGG repeats) that expand beyond a pathogenic threshold.  

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Trinucleotide repeat expansions** are unstable DNA sequences where a triplet (e.g., CAG, CTG) is repeated excessively, leading to disease.  
- Inheritance patterns may involve **anticipation** (worsening severity/earlier onset in subsequent generations due to repeat expansion during meiosis).  
- Examples include Huntington disease (CAG repeats), fragile X syndrome (CGG repeats), and myotonic dystrophy (CTG repeats).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Cystic fibrosis**  
  - Caused by mutations in the *CFTR* gene, most commonly the **F508del** frameshift deletion (not a repeat expansion).  
  - **Incorrect**.  

- **Option 2: Duchenne muscular dystrophy**  
  - Caused by deletions, duplications, or nonsense mutations in the *DMD* gene, disrupting dystrophin production.  
  - **Not associated with triplet repeats**. **Incorrect**.  

- **Option 3: Huntington disease**  
  - Caused by **CAG repeat expansion** in the *HTT* gene.  
  - Normal alleles: ≤26 repeats; pathogenic alleles: ≥40 repeats.  
  - Classic example of a trinucleotide repeat disorder. **Correct**.  

- **Option 4: Osteogenesis imperfecta**  
  - Primarily caused by mutations in *COL1A1* or *COL1A2* (collagen type I genes), typically point mutations or small deletions.  
  - **No association with repeat expansions**. **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
- Huntington disease (Option 3) is a well-established trinucleotide repeat disorder caused by CAG expansion in *HTT*.  
- Other options involve distinct mutational mechanisms (deletions, frameshifts, point mutations) unrelated to triplet repeat expansions.  

**My final selection is: Option 3**
