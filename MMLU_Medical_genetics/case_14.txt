**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is asking for an example of **monosomy**, a genetic condition where there is only one copy of a particular chromosome instead of the usual pair. Understanding chromosomal number variations and their nomenclature is essential to identify which option represents monosomy.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Monosomy** refers to the presence of only one chromosome from a particular pair in the cell. In humans, most cells are diploid, containing two copies of each chromosome except for the sex chromosomes in males (XY).
- **Karyotype Notation**:
  - The first number indicates the total number of chromosomes.
  - The letters and numbers following represent the sex chromosomes (e.g., XX for female, XYY for a male with extra sex chromosomes).
- **Examples of Chromosomal Abnormalities**:
  - **Trisomy**: An extra chromosome (e.g., 47,XXX).
  - **Monosomy**: A missing chromosome (e.g., 45,X).
  - **Polyploidy**: More than two sets of chromosomes (e.g., 69,XYY).

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **46,XX**
   - **Explanation**: This represents the normal female karyotype with two X chromosomes.
   - **Assessment**: Correct number of chromosomes with no missing or extra chromosomes.
   - **Conclusion**: **Incorrect**.

2. **47,XXX**
   - **Explanation**: This indicates Triple X syndrome, where there is an extra X chromosome in females.
   - **Assessment**: Presence of an extra chromosome (trisomy), not monosomy.
   - **Conclusion**: **Incorrect**.

3. **69,XYY**
   - **Explanation**: This is an atypical karyotype with additional sex chromosomes.
   - **Assessment**: Represents polyploidy with extra chromosomes, not monosomy.
   - **Conclusion**: **Incorrect**.

4. **45,X**
   - **Explanation**: This signifies Turner syndrome, where there is only one X chromosome and the absence of the second sex chromosome.
   - **Assessment**: Represents monosomy X, as there is a missing chromosome.
   - **Conclusion**: **Correct**.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks for an example of *monosomy*, which refers to the presence of a single chromosome instead of the usual pair in a diploid cell. Monosomy results in a chromosome number of **2n-1** (e.g., 45 chromosomes in humans). The task is to identify which karyotype matches this definition.  

---

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Monosomy Definition**: A monosomic individual has one fewer chromosome than the diploid number (46 in humans).  
- **Turner Syndrome**: The most well-known human monosomy is **45,X** (Turner syndrome), where one sex chromosome is missing.  
- **Normal Karyotypes**:  
  - **46,XX** or **46,XY**: Diploid (normal).  
  - **47,XXX** or **47,XYY**: Trisomy for the X or Y chromosome.  
- **Triploidy**: Chromosome number 69 (e.g., 69,XYY) indicates triploidy (three chromosome sets), which is usually lethal in humans.  

---

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **46,XX**:  
   - Normal female karyotype with 46 chromosomes (diploid).  
   - **Incorrect** because monosomy requires 45 chromosomes.  

2. **47,XXX**:  
   - Triple X syndrome (trisomy X). The individual has an extra X chromosome.  
   - **Incorrect** because it is a trisomy, not a monosomy.  

3. **69,XYY**:  
   - Triploid karyotype (three chromosome sets). Triploidy is typically incompatible with life.  
   - **Incorrect** because monosomy refers to a single chromosome loss, not triploidy.  

4. **45,X**:  
   - Turner syndrome, the only viable human monosomy. The individual has one X chromosome instead of two (in females) or an X and Y (in males).  
   - **Correct** because it directly fits the definition of monosomy.  

---

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  

**Explanation**:  
- **45,X** is the classic example of monosomy. It results from the loss of one sex chromosome (typically the second X or Y), leading to a diploid number of 45. Turner syndrome (45,X) is the only naturally occurring monosomy that allows viability in humans.  
- The other options either represent euploidy (46,XX), trisomy (47,XXX), or triploidy (69,XYY), none of which qualify as monosomy.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks to identify an example of monosomy, which refers to the absence of one chromosome in a diploid organism, resulting in a total of 45 chromosomes (2n−1). This requires distinguishing monosomy from other chromosomal abnormalities like trisomy or polyploidy.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- Monosomy occurs when an individual lacks one chromosome from a pair, leading to a karyotype of 45 chromosomes.  
- Trisomy involves an extra chromosome (47 chromosomes, 2n+1).  
- Polyploidy (e.g., triploidy: 69 chromosomes) involves entire extra sets of chromosomes.  
- Turner syndrome (45,X) is a classic example of monosomy, where females have a single X chromosome.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (46,XX):** Normal female karyotype (diploid); no monosomy. **Incorrect.**  
- **Option 2 (47,XXX):** Trisomy X (three X chromosomes); a trisomy, not monosomy. **Incorrect.**  
- **Option 3 (69,XYY):** Triploidy (three full chromosome sets); unrelated to monosomy. **Incorrect.**  
- **Option 4 (45,X):** Missing one sex chromosome (monosomy X), diagnostic of Turner syndrome. **Correct.**

**4. Final Selection**  
Monosomy specifically refers to the loss of a single chromosome. Among the options, only **45,X** fits this definition.  

**My final selection is: Option 4**
