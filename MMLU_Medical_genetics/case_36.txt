**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is asking which of the listed genetic conditions exhibits anticipation specifically when transmitted through the paternal line. Anticipation refers to the phenomenon where a genetic disorder becomes more severe or presents at an earlier age in successive generations. The focus is on understanding how anticipation manifests in different genetic disorders and whether it is influenced by the parent of origin.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Anticipation** is often associated with disorders caused by trinucleotide repeat expansions. The number of repeats can increase in successive generations, leading to earlier onset or increased severity.
- **Huntington Disease**: An autosomal dominant disorder caused by CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene. Anticipation is typically observed, especially with paternal transmission where repeat expansions are more common.
- **Fragile X Syndrome**: Caused by CGG repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene. Anticipation is prominent, but expansions primarily occur during maternal transmission.
- **Marfan Syndrome**: An autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene. It does not typically exhibit anticipation.
- **Cystic Fibrosis**: An autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. Anticipation is not a recognized feature.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Huntington disease**  
   - **Correct.** Huntington disease is known to display anticipation, particularly through paternal transmission where CAG repeats in the HTT gene can expand in sperm, leading to earlier onset and increased severity in offspring.
   
2. **Marfan syndrome**  
   - **Incorrect.** While Marfan syndrome is a serious genetic disorder, it does not typically show anticipation. The severity and age of onset remain relatively consistent across generations.
   
3. **Cystic fibrosis**  
   - **Incorrect.** Cystic fibrosis does not exhibit anticipation. It is an autosomal recessive disorder, and the number of mutations does not increase in subsequent generations.
   
4. **Fragile X syndrome**  
   - **Incorrect.** Although Fragile X syndrome does show anticipation due to CGG repeat expansions, this primarily occurs through maternal transmission, not paternal.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks which genetic condition exhibits **anticipation** specifically in paternal transmission.  
- Anticipation refers to the phenomenon where the severity of a genetic disorder or the age of onset decreases with each generation, often due to unstable DNA repeat expansions.  
- The key is to identify a disorder caused by a **trinucleotide repeat expansion** where paternal transmission correlates with increased repeat instability.  

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Anticipation** is most commonly associated with disorders involving **trinucleotide repeat expansions** (e.g., CAG, CGG).  
- The direction of transmission (paternal vs. maternal) can influence repeat instability:  
  - **Paternal transmission** often leads to larger expansions in disorders like Huntington disease (HD) due to mechanisms like slipped-strand mispairing during spermatogenesis.  
  - **Maternal transmission** is more associated with expansion in disorders like Fragile X syndrome (FXS), as egg cells may allow repeat expansion during oogenesis.  
- **Inheritance patterns**:  
  - HD: Autosomal dominant with CAG repeat expansion in *HTT*.  
  - FXS: X-linked dominant caused by CGG repeat expansion in *FMR1*.  
  - Marfan syndrome and cystic fibrosis are autosomal dominant and recessive conditions without repeat expansions.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Huntington disease):**  
  - **Correct**. HD is caused by CAG repeat expansion in the *HTT* gene. Anticipation is well-documented, with paternal transmission correlating with larger repeat expansions due to spermatogenesis.  
- **Option 2 (Marfan syndrome):**  
  - **Incorrect**. Caused by mutations in *FBN1*, which does not involve repeat expansions. Anticipation is not a feature.  
- **Option 3 (Cystic fibrosis):**  
  - **Incorrect**. Caused by mutations in *CFTR*; autosomal recessive inheritance without repeat expansions. Anticipation does not occur.  
- **Option 4 (Fragile X syndrome):**  
  - **Incorrect**. Caused by CGG repeat expansion in *FMR1*. Anticipation occurs but is more pronounced in **maternal** transmission, as ovarian DNA replication allows greater expansion potential.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**  

**Explanation:**  
Huntington disease is the only condition listed that exhibits anticipation specifically linked to **paternal transmission** due to the instability of CAG repeats during spermatogenesis. Fragile X syndrome also shows anticipation but primarily through maternal transmission, making Option 1 the correct answer.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which genetic condition exhibits anticipation (earlier onset or increased severity in successive generations) specifically when transmitted paternally. This requires understanding of genetic disorders associated with dynamic mutations (e.g., trinucleotide repeat expansions) and parent-of-origin effects.  

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Anticipation** occurs in disorders caused by unstable **trinucleotide repeat expansions**, where repeats lengthen during gamete formation, leading to more severe phenotypes in offspring.  
- **Parent-of-origin effects**: Some repeats are more prone to expansion depending on the transmitting parent’s sex. For example, paternal transmission is linked to greater repeat expansion in Huntington disease, while maternal transmission is critical for Fragile X syndrome.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Huntington disease**  
  - Caused by **CAG repeat expansion** in the *HTT* gene (autosomal dominant).  
  - Paternal transmission is strongly associated with repeat expansion, leading to anticipation (earlier onset in offspring). **Correct**.  

- **Option 2: Marfan syndrome**  
  - Caused by mutations in *FBN1* (autosomal dominant) but involves **fibrillin-1** defects, not repeat expansions.  
  - No anticipation mechanism. **Incorrect**.  

- **Option 3: Cystic fibrosis**  
  - Autosomal recessive, caused by **point mutations/deletions** in *CFTR*.  
  - No repeat expansions or anticipation. **Incorrect**.  

- **Option 4: Fragile X syndrome**  
  - Caused by **CGG repeat expansion** in *FMR1* (X-linked).  
  - Anticipation occurs primarily through **maternal transmission** (premutation in mothers expands to full mutation in offspring). Paternal transmission of premutations does not result in full mutations. **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
Huntington disease is the only condition where paternal transmission directly correlates with repeat expansion and anticipation. Fragile X syndrome, while showing anticipation, depends on maternal transmission for full mutation expansion.  

**My final selection is: Option 1**
