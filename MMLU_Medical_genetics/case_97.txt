**1. Question Analysis**  
The question addresses the discrepancy between heritability estimates of body mass index (BMI) derived from twin and family studies and the proportion of BMI variation explained by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Specifically, it seeks to quantify the extent to which known SNPs account for BMI variation despite high heritability estimates.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Heritability of BMI:** Twin and family studies have consistently shown that BMI has a heritability estimate exceeding 50%, indicating that over half of the variation in BMI can be attributed to genetic factors.
- **Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS):** GWAS scan the genome for SNPs associated with specific traits, such as BMI. While GWAS have identified numerous SNPs linked to BMI, individually these SNPs typically have small effect sizes.
- **Missing Heritability:** Despite identifying many SNPs, GWAS collectively explain only a fraction of the heritable component of complex traits like BMI. This gap between heritability estimates and explained genetic variation is referred to as "missing heritability."
- **Polygenic Nature of BMI:** BMI is influenced by a large number of genetic variants, each contributing a small effect. The cumulative effect of these variants accounts for a modest portion of BMI variation.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Only 5%:** While this option suggests a minor contribution, studies have shown that the combined effect of known SNPs explains slightly less than this percentage for BMI.
2. **Less than 1%:** This underestimates the contribution of SNPs, as empirical studies indicate a higher percentage.
3. **Only 13%:** This overestimates the current explanatory power of known SNPs in GWAS for BMI.
4. **Less than 2%:** Empirical evidence supports that known SNPs account for approximately 1-2% of BMI variation, making this the most accurate estimation among the provided options.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question focuses on the discrepancy between the proportion of BMI variation explained by known SNPs in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and the higher heritability estimates from twin/family studies.  
- Key concepts include GWAS methodology, SNP contributions to complex traits, and the "missing heritability" problem.  

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **GWAS Basics**: GWAS identifies common genetic variants (SNPs) associated with traits like BMI. These studies typically detect variants with small individual effects.  
- **Heritability vs. Explained Variance**: Twin studies suggest ~50% of BMI variation is heritable, but GWAS-identified SNPs explain only a fraction of this.  
- **Missing Heritability**: The gap arises because GWAS may miss rare variants, gene-gene interactions, epistasis, and environmental-genetic interactions.  
- **Cumulative SNP Effect**: While many SNPs are identified, their combined effect on BMI variance remains low due to small individual contributions.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (only 5%)**: Too high. Early GWAS for BMI explained ~1-2% of variance. Even with modern studies, the total remains <10%, so 5% is a plausible intermediate but not the most accurate.  
- **Option 2 (less than 1%)**: Too low. By 2010, studies like those involving the FTO gene explained ~0.3% for a single SNP, but cumulative effects reached ~1-2%, exceeding this threshold.  
- **Option 3 (only 13%)**: Exceedingly high. Even recent studies (e.g., 2020) report ~10% explained variance, but 13% is not widely cited as the standard figure for this question.  
- **Option 4 (less than 2%)**: Most accurate. Early GWAS (pre-2015) consistently found <2% variance explained. Even modern studies rarely exceed ~3%, making "less than 2%" a conservative but correct estimate for the question’s context.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  
The correct answer is **less than 2%**. Early GWAS for BMI, which the question likely references, identified SNPs explaining ~1-2% of BMI variance. The "less than 2%" phrasing aligns with this, while other options over- or underestimate based on current or outdated data. The gap between GWAS results and heritability reflects the missing heritability problem, where most genetic contributions remain unaccounted for due to factors like rare variants or gene-environment interactions.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question addresses the discrepancy between the heritability of body mass index (BMI) estimated from twin/family studies (>50%) and the proportion of variance explained by known SNPs identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). It tests understanding of "missing heritability" in complex polygenic traits.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Heritability vs. GWAS Variance**: Twin studies capture total genetic contribution (common/rare variants, additive/non-additive effects), while GWAS primarily identify common SNPs with small individual effects.  
- **Missing Heritability**: GWAS SNPs often explain a small fraction of heritability due to factors like rare variants, gene-environment interactions, and epistasis.  
- **BMI as a Polygenic Trait**: BMI involves hundreds of loci, each contributing minimally. Early GWAS for BMI explained <2% variance, even as heritability estimates remained high.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (5%)**: Overestimates early GWAS findings. While recent large-scale meta-analyses approach ~5-6%, the question emphasizes the *contrast* with high heritability, implying a lower value.  
- **Option 2 (<1%)**: Too low; even early GWAS (e.g., 2012) identified SNPs explaining ~1.5-2%.  
- **Option 3 (13%)**: Exceeds known estimates; no GWAS for BMI approaches this figure.  
- **Option 4 (<2%)**: Aligns with foundational GWAS studies (e.g., 2010-2015) reporting ~1.5-2.7% variance explained, highlighting the "missing heritability" gap.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  
The most accurate answer is **less than 2%**, as GWAS-identified SNPs for BMI historically explain a small fraction of variance (~1.5-2.7%) despite high heritability. This exemplifies the "missing heritability" paradox, where common SNPs fail to account for most genetic influence. While newer studies approach higher percentages, the question’s phrasing aligns with earlier data emphasizing the stark discrepancy.
