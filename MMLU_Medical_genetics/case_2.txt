**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question focuses on determining the expected frequency of females affected by an X-linked recessive condition, given that the frequency of affected males in the population is 0.10 (one in ten). It requires an understanding of X-linked recessive inheritance patterns and how allele frequencies translate to disease prevalence in both sexes.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **X-Linked Recessive Inheritance:** In X-linked recessive conditions, the mutated gene resides on the X chromosome. Males (XY) are hemizygous for the X chromosome, meaning a single mutated allele will result in the disease. Females (XX), however, must have two copies of the mutated allele to express the condition (homozygous recessive).
- **Allele Frequency Calculation:** The frequency of affected males directly reflects the frequency of the mutant allele (p) since males have only one X chromosome. Therefore, if 10% of males are affected, p = 0.10.
- **Frequency of Affected Females:** For females to be affected, they must inherit two copies of the mutant allele. Using the Hardy-Weinberg principle, the expected frequency of affected females is p².

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **0.01:**  
   - Calculation: p² = (0.10)² = 0.01  
   - Interpretation: Represents the expected frequency of females who are homozygous recessive for the condition.  
   - **Correctness:** This aligns with genetic principles for X-linked recessive conditions.
   
2. **0.001:**  
   - Interpretation: This would imply an allele frequency of 0.0316 (since √0.001 ≈ 0.0316), which does not match the given male frequency.  
   - **Correctness:** Incorrect.
   
3. **0.02:**  
   - Interpretation: This is twice the correct frequency (2 × 0.01), which doesn't align with genetic calculations.  
   - **Correctness:** Incorrect.
   
4. **0.0001:**  
   - Calculation: (0.01)² = 0.0001  
   - Interpretation: This would suggest an extremely low allele frequency, which contradicts the given male frequency.  
   - **Correctness:** Incorrect.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks about the expected frequency of affected females in a population where the frequency of males affected with an X-linked recessive condition is 0.10. This requires understanding X-linked inheritance patterns and how allele frequencies translate to disease prevalence in males versus females.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **X-linked recessive inheritance**: Males (XY) are affected if they inherit the recessive allele on their single X chromosome. Females (XX) are affected only if they inherit two copies of the recessive allele (homozygous recessive).  
- **Allele frequency (q)**: The frequency of the recessive allele in the population is equal to the frequency of affected males (since males have only one X chromosome). Here, q = 0.10.  
- **Female carrier frequency**: Females can be carriers (heterozygous, XRXr) at a frequency of 2q(1−q), but carriers are not phenotypically affected.  
- **Affected females**: The frequency of homozygous recessive females (XrXr) is q², calculated by squaring the allele frequency.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (0.01)**:  
  This matches q² (0.10² = 0.01). This is the correct calculation for the frequency of homozygous recessive females.  
- **Option 2 (0.001)**:  
  Incorrect. This would be q³ (0.10³ = 0.001), which has no biological relevance in this context.  
- **Option 3 (0.02)**:  
  Incorrect. This represents 2q (2 × 0.10 = 0.20) or 2q(1−q) (≈0.18), but neither corresponds to the frequency of affected females.  
- **Option 4 (0.0001)**:  
  Incorrect. This is q⁴ (0.10⁴ = 0.0001), which is not applicable here.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**  

The frequency of affected females in an X-linked recessive disorder is the square of the recessive allele frequency (q²). Since q = 0.10 (frequency of affected males), q² = 0.01. This matches Option 1. The other options incorrectly apply different exponents or formulas unrelated to X-linked recessive inheritance.

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks for the expected frequency of females affected by an X-linked recessive condition when the male prevalence is 10% (0.10). This requires understanding X-linked recessive inheritance and Hardy-Weinberg principles.  

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **X-linked recessive inheritance**: Males (XY) require only one recessive allele (on their single X) to express the condition. Females (XX) require two recessive alleles (one on each X).  
- **Allele frequency**: The frequency of affected males (q) equals the recessive allele frequency. For females, the frequency of being homozygous recessive is \( q^2 \).  
- **Assumptions**: The population follows Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (random mating, no selection, etc.).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (0.01)**: If the male frequency (q) is 0.10, then female frequency = \( q^2 = (0.10)^2 = 0.01 \). Matches genetic principles. **Correct**.  
- **Option 2 (0.001)**: Implies \( q = \sqrt{0.001} \approx 0.0316 \), inconsistent with the given male frequency (0.10). **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 3 (0.02)**: Suggests \( q = \sqrt{0.02} \approx 0.14 \), inconsistent with the male frequency (0.10). **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 4 (0.0001)**: Implies \( q = \sqrt{0.0001} = 0.01 \), inconsistent with the male frequency (0.10). **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The correct answer is derived directly from the Hardy-Weinberg equation for X-linked recessive conditions. Since \( q = 0.10 \), the female frequency is \( q^2 = 0.01 \).  

**My final selection is: Option 1**
