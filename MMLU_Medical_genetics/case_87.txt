**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks about the classification of the effect exerted by mutations that cause achondroplasia. Specifically, it seeks to understand the nature of these mutations in terms of their functional impact on gene or protein activity within the context of medical genetics.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Achondroplasia** is a common form of disproportionate dwarfism caused primarily by mutations in the FGFR3 gene.
- **FGFR3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3)** plays a crucial role in bone development by regulating bone growth.
- The mutation associated with achondroplasia typically leads to an **abnormally active FGFR3 protein**, which excessively inhibits bone growth, particularly in the long bones.
- Understanding the type of mutation involves recognizing whether it leads to a gain or loss of function, dominant negative effects, or haploinsufficiency.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Dominant Negative:**  
   - This refers to a mutant gene product that antagonizes the function of the wild-type product within the same cell.  
   - Achondroplasia does not involve the mutant FGFR3 protein inhibiting the normal protein; instead, it enhances its activity.
   - **Incorrect.**

2. **Gain-of-Function:**  
   - This involves mutations that result in a protein with enhanced, new, or abnormal functions.  
   - The FGFR3 mutations in achondroplasia cause the receptor to be constitutively active, leading to increased inhibition of bone growth.
   - This represents a gain of function because the mutated protein has an increased or new activity level.
   - **Correct.**

3. **Haploinsufficiency:**  
   - Occurs when a single functional copy of a gene is insufficient to maintain normal function.
   - Achondroplasia is not due to a reduction in gene dosage but rather an increase in the activity of the FGFR3 protein.
   - **Incorrect.**

4. **Loss-of-Function:**  
   - Involves mutations that result in reduced or abolished protein function.
   - Achondroplasia mutations do not reduce FGFR3 function; they enhance its activity.
   - **Incorrect.**

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks about the genetic mechanism underlying achondroplasia, focusing on the classification of the mutation's effect.  
- Key concepts include mutation types (e.g., gain-of-function vs. loss-of-function), inheritance patterns (dominant vs. recessive), and the molecular basis of the disorder.  

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Achondroplasia** is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by impaired endochondral bone growth, leading to disproportionate short stature.  
- The disorder is primarily caused by **activating mutations** in the *FGFR3* gene, which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in regulating bone growth.  
- Normally, FGFR3 inhibits bone growth. Mutations in this gene lead to a **constitutively active receptor**, resulting in excessive inhibition of chondrocyte proliferation and bone elongation.  
- **Gain-of-function mutations** cause the protein to acquire a new harmful activity (e.g., constant activation), while **loss-of-function mutations** reduce or eliminate the protein’s normal activity.  
- **Dominant-negative mutations** occur when the mutant protein interferes with the function of the wild-type protein, often in dominant disorders caused by loss-of-function alleles.  
- **Haploinsufficiency** refers to insufficient protein from one normal allele to maintain function, typically seen in autosomal dominant disorders caused by loss-of-function mutations.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (dominant negative):** Incorrect. Dominant-negative mutations involve interference between mutant and wild-type proteins. In achondroplasia, the mutant FGFR3 acts independently to hyperactivate the receptor, rather than inhibiting the wild-type protein.  
- **Option 2 (gain-of-function):** Correct. The *FGFR3* mutations result in a hyperactive receptor that excessively inhibits bone growth, representing a new harmful activity.  
- **Option 3 (haploinsufficiency):** Incorrect. Haploinsufficiency implies insufficient protein from one normal allele, but achondroplasia’s pathogenesis arises from the mutant allele’s overactive function, not a lack of normal protein.  
- **Option 4 (loss-of-function):** Incorrect. Loss-of-function mutations would reduce FGFR3 activity, which would likely increase bone growth (the opposite of achondroplasia’s phenotype).  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  
The mutations in *FGFR3* that cause achondroplasia lead to a **gain-of-function**, as the receptor becomes constitutively active, excessively inhibiting bone growth. This mechanism aligns with the dominant inheritance pattern and the disorder’s clinical features.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks to classify the genetic effect of mutations causing achondroplasia. This requires understanding the molecular mechanism of the disorder and how mutations in the responsible gene (FGFR3) alter protein function.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- Achondroplasia is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the *FGFR3* gene.  
- FGFR3 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that normally inhibits chondrocyte proliferation in growth plates, regulating bone elongation.  
- Over 95% of cases involve a specific gain-of-function mutation (p.Gly380Arg), leading to constitutive activation of FGFR3. This hyperactivity suppresses bone growth, causing disproportionate short stature.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Dominant negative):** Incorrect. Dominant negative effects occur when a mutant protein disrupts the function of the normal protein (e.g., structural proteins like collagen). FGFR3 mutations in achondroplasia do not interfere with wild-type receptors but instead act independently as hyperactive receptors.  
- **Option 2 (Gain-of-function):** Correct. The FGFR3 mutation causes constitutive activation of the receptor, enhancing its inhibitory signaling on bone growth. This aligns with a gain-of-function mechanism.  
- **Option 3 (Haploinsufficiency):** Incorrect. Haploinsufficiency implies insufficient gene product due to one functional allele. Achondroplasia is not caused by reduced FGFR3 activity but by excessive signaling.  
- **Option 4 (Loss-of-function):** Incorrect. Loss-of-function mutations reduce or eliminate protein activity, which contradicts the hyperactive FGFR3 observed in achondroplasia.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The mutations in FGFR3 cause constitutive activation of the receptor, leading to excessive inhibition of bone growth. This is a classic example of a gain-of-function mechanism.  

**My final selection is: Option 2**
