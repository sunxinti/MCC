**1. Question Analysis**
- The question is inquiring about the standard number of chromosomes present in each human cell.
- It focuses on the basic chromosomal structure in humans, a fundamental concept in medical genetics.
- Understanding the typical chromosomal count is essential for comprehending genetic inheritance, anomalies, and related disorders.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**
- Humans are diploid organisms, meaning they have two sets of chromosomes: one set inherited from each parent.
- The human genome consists of 23 pairs of chromosomes, totaling 46 chromosomes in each somatic (non-reproductive) cell.
- Among these, 22 pairs are autosomes, and the 23rd pair consists of sex chromosomes (XX or XY).
- Correct chromosomal number is crucial for normal development; deviations can lead to genetic disorders such as Down syndrome (trisomy 21) or Turner syndrome (monosomy X).

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **11 pairs**  
   - Incorrect. Humans have significantly more chromosomes.
2. **23 pairs**  
   - Correct. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, totaling 46 chromosomes in each cell.
3. **32 pairs**  
   - Incorrect. This number exceeds the typical human chromosome count.
4. **46 pairs**  
   - Incorrect. Humans have a total of 46 chromosomes, but these are organized into 23 pairs, not 46 pairs.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is asking about the standard chromosomal composition of a normal human cell.  
- It focuses on foundational genetic concepts related to chromosome numbers and ploidy.  

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- Human somatic cells are **diploid** (2n), meaning they contain two sets of chromosomes (one from each parent).  
- The **diploid number** of chromosomes in humans is **46**, which consists of **23 pairs of homologous chromosomes**.  
- Each pair represents one chromosome inherited from the mother and one from the father.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (11 pairs):** Incorrect. This would total 22 chromosomes, far below the human diploid number of 46.  
- **Option 2 (23 pairs):** Correct. 23 pairs equal 46 chromosomes, the standard diploid number for humans.  
- **Option 3 (32 pairs):** Incorrect. This would total 64 chromosomes, exceeding the human diploid number.  
- **Option 4 (46 pairs):** Incorrect. This would total 92 chromosomes, which is double the human diploid number and biologically impossible.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  
- Humans have **23 pairs of chromosomes** (totaling 46 chromosomes) in somatic cells. This reflects the diploid state (2n = 46), where each pair consists of homologous chromosomes inherited from each parent. The other options either miscalculate the total number of chromosomes or misrepresent the concept of chromosomal pairing.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks for the number of chromosome pairs in a normal human cell, testing knowledge of human diploid chromosome structure.  

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- Humans are diploid organisms, meaning somatic cells contain two sets of chromosomes (one from each parent).  
- The total diploid number is **46 chromosomes**, organized into **23 pairs**: 22 pairs of autosomes and 1 pair of sex chromosomes (XX or XY).  
- Gametes (sperm/egg) are haploid (23 single chromosomes), while somatic cells are diploid (23 pairs).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (11 pairs):** Incorrect. 11 pairs (22 chromosomes) would represent a severely aneuploid state incompatible with life.  
- **Option 2 (23 pairs):** Correct. Humans have 23 pairs (46 total chromosomes) in diploid cells.  
- **Option 3 (32 pairs):** Incorrect. 32 pairs (64 chromosomes) is not observed in humans and would indicate polyploidy.  
- **Option 4 (46 pairs):** Incorrect. 46 pairs (92 chromosomes) would represent tetraploidy, a rare and abnormal condition.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The correct answer is **23 pairs**, as this reflects the diploid chromosome number in normal human somatic cells.  

**My final selection is: Option 2**
