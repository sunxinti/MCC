**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is assessing the probability of obtaining a specific genotype, AABBCC, from the mating of two individuals who are both heterozygous (AaBbCc) for three different genes. This involves understanding Mendelian inheritance patterns, specifically the principles of independent assortment and probability calculations in genetics.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Independent Assortment:** Each gene (A/a, B/b, C/c) segregates independently during gamete formation, meaning the inheritance of one gene does not influence the inheritance of another.
- **Monohybrid Cross Principles:** For each gene, heterozygous parents (Aa) can produce offspring with genotypes AA, Aa, or aa, with probabilities of 1/4, 1/2, and 1/4, respectively.
- **Trinomial Probability Calculation:** Since there are three independent genes, the overall probability of obtaining the homozygous dominant genotype for all three genes (AABBCC) is the product of the individual probabilities for each gene.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: 1.0/64**  
  - Calculation: (1/4 for AA) × (1/4 for BB) × (1/4 for CC) = 1/64  
  - **Correct**  
- **Option 2: 1.0/32**  
  - This would imply a higher probability than calculated. It does not align with the independent probability multiplication.  
  - **Incorrect**  
- **Option 3: 1.0/128**  
  - This suggests a lower probability than calculated, which does not match the product of individual probabilities.  
  - **Incorrect**  
- **Option 4: 1.0/256**  
  - This significantly underestimates the probability, making it inconsistent with the genetic principles applied.  
  - **Incorrect**

**4. Final Selection**  
- **My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks for the probability of offspring with the genotype AABBCC when two AaBbCc individuals mate.  
- This involves understanding independent assortment of three unlinked genes (A, B, C), calculating the combined probability of homozygous dominant genotypes for all three genes.  

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Independent Assortment**: Each gene (A, B, C) segregates independently.  
- **Heterozygous Parents**: Each parent (AaBbCc) has a 50% chance of passing each allele (A/a, B/b, C/c).  
- **Homozygous Dominant Genotype (e.g., AA)**: Requires both parents to contribute the dominant allele (A). The probability for each gene is (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/4.  
- **Combined Probability**: Multiply probabilities for each gene since events are independent.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (1/64)**:  
  - Correct. The probability for each gene to be homozygous dominant (AA, BB, CC) is 1/4. Combined: (1/4) × (1/4) × (1/4) = 1/64.  
- **Option 2 (1/32)**:  
  - Incorrect. This would be the probability if only two genes were involved (e.g., AABB), not three.  
- **Option 3 (1/128)**:  
  - Incorrect. This value is half of the correct probability (1/64). Likely due to an error in calculating the exponent (e.g., 2⁻⁶ instead of 2⁻⁶ for three independent 1/4 terms).  
- **Option 4 (1/256)**:  
  - Incorrect. This would apply if each gene required a recessive homozygous outcome (e.g., aabbcc), but the question specifies dominant homozygous.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**  

The correct probability is 1/64 because each gene independently contributes a 1/4 chance of being homozygous dominant (AA, BB, or CC). Multiplying these probabilities (1/4 × 1/4 × 1/4) yields 1/64, matching **Option 1**.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks for the frequency of an offspring with genotype AABBCC resulting from a mating between two AaBbCc individuals. This requires understanding of Mendelian inheritance for independently assorting genes and calculating probabilities for homozygous dominant offspring across three loci.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Independent Assortment**: Assuming the genes A, B, and C are unlinked, their alleles segregate independently during gamete formation.  
- **Homozygous Dominant Probability**: For each gene (e.g., A), the probability of an offspring inheriting two dominant alleles (AA) from heterozygous parents (Aa × Aa) is calculated as follows:  
  - Each parent has a 50% chance of transmitting the dominant allele (A).  
  - Probability of AA = (1/2 from father) × (1/2 from mother) = **1/4 per gene**.  
- **Combined Probability**: Since the three genes are independent, the total probability is the product of probabilities for each gene:  
  **1/4 (AA) × 1/4 (BB) × 1/4 (CC) = (1/4)³ = 1/64**.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (1/64)**: Matches the calculated probability for AABBCC (1/4³ = 1/64). **Correct**.  
- **Option 2 (1/32)**: Incorrect. This would apply if the probability for one gene were 1/2 (e.g., Aa × Aa yielding Aa offspring), but here all three genes require homozygous dominance.  
- **Option 3 (1/128)** and **Option 4 (1/256)**: Incorrect. These values are inconsistent with the multiplicative probability of independent events (1/4³).  

**4. Final Selection**  
The frequency of AABBCC offspring is **1/64**, as each homozygous dominant genotype (AA, BB, CC) independently contributes a 1/4 probability, and their combination follows the product rule.  

**My final selection is: Option 1**
