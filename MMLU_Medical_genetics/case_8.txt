**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question assesses the risk of developmental abnormalities in the child of a mother with untreated phenylketonuria (PKU). It explores the impact of maternal PKU on fetal development rather than the inheritance risk of PKU itself.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Phenylketonuria (PKU):** PKU is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by mutations in the PAH gene, leading to impaired metabolism of the amino acid phenylalanine. 
- **Maternal PKU Effects:** When a mother has untreated PKU, elevated phenylalanine levels can cross the placenta and adversely affect the developing fetus, even if the fetus does not inherit PKU. This can result in intellectual disabilities, microcephaly, congenital heart defects, and other developmental abnormalities.
- **Importance of Treatment:** Proper dietary management of PKU in pregnant women significantly reduces the risk of these adverse outcomes.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **1%**
   - *Incorrect.* This percentage is too low to represent the high risk associated with untreated maternal PKU.
2. **10%**
   - *Incorrect.* While higher than 1%, this still underestimates the substantial risk posed by elevated phenylalanine levels.
3. **25%**
   - *Incorrect.* This option suggests a moderate risk, which does not fully capture the severe potential consequences of untreated maternal PKU.
4. **Almost 100%**
   - *Correct.* Untreated maternal PKU is associated with a near certainty of causing significant developmental abnormalities in the fetus due to the teratogenic effects of high phenylalanine levels.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks about the risk of congenital abnormalities in the offspring of a mother with untreated phenylketonuria (PKU). It focuses on understanding the teratogenic effects of maternal PKU during pregnancy rather than the inheritance pattern of PKU itself.  

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Phenylketonuria (PKU):** An autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the *PAH* gene, leading to phenylalanine (Phe) accumulation.  
- **Untreated PKU in Pregnancy:** Women with untreated PKU have elevated maternal plasma Phe levels. During pregnancy, this Phe crosses the placenta and can cause fetal developmental abnormalities (maternal PKU syndrome), even if the fetus is not genetically affected by PKU.  
- **Mechanism:** High maternal Phe levels are teratogenic, disrupting fetal brain development, vascular formation, and organogenesis. The risk is independent of the child’s own genetic status (e.g., whether the child inherits PKU).  
- **Key Fact:** The risk of maternal PKU syndrome in an untreated pregnancy is **~80–90%**, with severe congenital defects (e.g., microcephaly, cardiac defects, growth restriction) if maternal Phe levels remain uncontrolled.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (1%):** Incorrect. This is far too low. The risk of congenital abnormalities in maternal PKU is not rare but highly prevalent (~80–90%) when untreated.  
- **Option 2 (10%):** Incorrect. This underestimates the risk. The teratogenic effects of maternal PKU are well-documented and occur in the majority of untreated pregnancies.  
- **Option 3 (25%):** Incorrect. This figure aligns with autosomal recessive inheritance risks (if both parents are carriers), but the question is about maternal PKU’s teratogenic effects, not the child’s own genetic status.  
- **Option 4 (Almost 100%):** Correct. While not 100%, the risk is extremely high (~80–90%) in untreated maternal PKU pregnancies due to the teratogenic effects of maternal Phe. This option best approximates the clinical reality.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  

The risk of congenital abnormalities in the child of a mother with untreated PKU is **almost 100%** due to the teratogenic effects of elevated maternal phenylalanine levels during pregnancy. This is unrelated to the child’s own genetic inheritance of PKU and instead reflects the maternal metabolic environment. Clinical data consistently show that >80% of untreated maternal PKU pregnancies result in severe fetal abnormalities, making "Almost 100%" the most accurate choice.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks about the risk of congenital abnormalities in the offspring of a mother with untreated phenylketonuria (PKU). It focuses on teratogenic effects of maternal hyperphenylalaninemia, not inheritance of PKU itself.  

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Maternal PKU Syndrome**: Untreated PKU during pregnancy results in elevated phenylalanine (Phe) levels, which cross the placenta and cause fetal damage (teratogenesis).  
- **Mechanism**: High Phe disrupts fetal development, leading to microcephaly, intellectual disability, congenital heart defects, and growth retardation.  
- **Risk Factor**: The risk is unrelated to the child's PKU genotype; even heterozygous or unaffected fetuses are harmed by the toxic maternal metabolic environment.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (1%)**: Incorrect. The risk is far higher due to direct teratogenic effects.  
- **Option 2 (10%)**: Incorrect. This underestimates the near-universal impact of maternal hyperphenylalaninemia.  
- **Option 3 (25%)**: Incorrect. This implies a Mendelian recessive inheritance risk (e.g., 25% for autosomal recessive disorders), which does not apply here.  
- **Option 4 (Almost 100%)**: Correct. Untreated maternal PKU almost invariably causes fetal abnormalities due to Phe toxicity, regardless of the child’s PKU status.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  
- Maternal hyperphenylalaninemia in untreated PKU is severely teratogenic, leading to developmental abnormalities in >90% of exposed fetuses. The risk approaches 100% due to the direct toxic effects of elevated Phe on fetal organogenesis, independent of the child’s genetic inheritance.
