**1. Question Analysis**

The question examines the regulatory mechanism of the lac operon in *E. coli*, specifically focusing on the impact of a mutation in the repressor protein under low glucose conditions. It requires an understanding of how mutations affecting repressor binding influence gene expression within the operon.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**

- **Lac Operon Functionality**: The lac operon controls the metabolism of lactose in *E. coli*. It consists of genes necessary for lactose uptake and breakdown.
  
- **Role of the Repressor**: The lac repressor protein binds to the operator region of the operon, preventing transcription in the absence of lactose. When lactose is present, it binds to the repressor, causing a conformational change that releases the repressor from the operator, allowing gene expression.
  
- **Mutation Impact**: A mutation that prevents the repressor from binding to lactose implies that lactose cannot inactivate the repressor. Consequently, the repressor remains bound to the operator, continuously blocking transcription regardless of lactose presence.
  
- **Glucose Levels**: Low glucose levels typically induce the operon to utilize alternative energy sources like lactose. However, if the repressor remains bound due to the mutation, this induction is impaired.

**3. Analysis of Options**

1. **Constitutive expression of the lac operon genes**  
   - *Incorrect*: Constitutive expression means the genes are continuously expressed, regardless of the presence or absence of lactose. However, in this scenario, the repressor remains bound (due to the mutation), preventing gene expression.
   
2. **Lack of expression or reduced expression of the lac operon genes under all circumstances**  
   - *Correct*: Since the repressor cannot be inactivated by lactose, it remains bound to the operator, blocking transcription even when lactose is present. This results in the lac operon genes not being expressed, even under conditions that normally would induce their expression (e.g., low glucose and presence of lactose).
   
3. **Expression of the genes only when lactose is present**  
   - *Incorrect*: This is the normal regulation mechanism. However, the mutation prevents repression from being lifted, so genes are not expressed even when lactose is present.
   
4. **Expression of the genes only when lactose is absent**  
   - *Incorrect*: This contradicts the normal function of the lac operon, where gene expression occurs in the presence of lactose. Additionally, the mutation maintains repression regardless of lactose presence.

**4. Final Selection**

**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question focuses on the regulation of the *lac operon* in *E. coli*, specifically addressing how a mutation in the repressor protein (preventing lactose binding) affects gene expression under conditions of low glucose. Key concepts involve operon regulation, inducer-repressor interactions, and the role of cAMP-CAP in transcriptional activation.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Lac Operon Regulation**: The *lac operon* is a inducible operon controlled by two mechanisms: (1) the repressor protein binds to the operator region to inhibit transcription in the absence of lactose (repressor-mediated repression), and (2) the cAMP-CAP complex binds to the promoter to activate transcription when glucose is scarce (CAP-mediated activation).  
- **Repressor Function**: Normally, the repressor binds to lactose (the inducer) to lose its affinity for the operator, allowing transcription. A mutation preventing lactose binding would lock the repressor in its active (DNA-binding) conformation.  
- **CAP-CRP Role**: When glucose is low, cAMP levels rise, activating CAP-CRP, which binds to the promoter and enhances transcription. However, CAP activation alone cannot override repressor-mediated repression.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Constitutive expression**  
  - *Incorrect*. Constitutive expression occurs when the operon is always "on," such as if the repressor cannot bind the operator (e.g., operator mutation). Here, the repressor retains its ability to bind the operator but cannot be inactivated by lactose. Thus, the operon remains repressed.  

- **Option 2: Lack of expression/reduced expression under all circumstances**  
  - *Correct*. The mutation prevents the repressor from being inactivated by lactose. Even if lactose is present, the repressor remains bound to the operator, blocking transcription. Since glucose is low, CAP-CRP is active, but it cannot overcome the repressor's binding. Thus, the *lac* operon is inactive regardless of lactose availability.  

- **Option 3: Expression only when lactose is present**  
  - *Incorrect*. Under normal conditions, lactose induces expression by binding the repressor. However, this mutation removes lactose's ability to inactivate the repressor, so lactose presence has no effect.  

- **Option 4: Expression only when lactose is absent**  
  - *Incorrect*. Lactose absence is the default condition where repression occurs. The mutation does not alter this scenario; it exacerbates repression by making the repressor unresponsive to lactose.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  

The mutation in the repressor prevents it from being inactivated by lactose, causing the repressor to remain bound to the operator. This permanently blocks transcription of the *lac* operon genes, irrespective of lactose availability. Even though low glucose activates CAP-CRP (which would normally promote expression when lactose is present), the repressor's persistent binding overrides this activation. Therefore, the operon cannot be expressed under any circumstances in this scenario.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question examines the impact of a mutation in the lac operon repressor that prevents binding to lactose. The focus is on understanding how this mutation affects operon expression when glucose is low. Key concepts include the lac operon's regulation by the repressor, inducer (lactose), and catabolite repression (via glucose/cAMP).

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Lac Operon Regulation**: The lac operon is typically repressed when lactose is absent (repressor binds operator) and induced when lactose is present (repressor binds lactose, releasing from the operator).  
- **Mutation Effect**: A repressor that cannot bind lactose cannot be inactivated. Thus, the repressor remains bound to the operator regardless of lactose presence, blocking transcription.  
- **Catabolite Repression**: Low glucose increases cAMP, activating CAP (catabolite activator protein), which enhances transcription. However, CAP alone cannot activate the operon if the repressor is bound to the operator.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Constitutive expression)**: Incorrect. Constitutive expression occurs if the repressor cannot bind the *operator*. Here, the repressor still binds the operator but cannot bind lactose, leading to constant repression.  
- **Option 2 (Lack/reduced expression always)**: Correct. The repressor remains bound to the operator (due to inability to bind lactose), preventing transcription even with lactose present or low glucose (high cAMP).  
- **Option 3 (Expression only with lactose)**: Incorrect. Lactose normally induces the operon by inactivating the repressor, but this mutation prevents lactose from having any effect.  
- **Option 4 (Expression only without lactose)**: Incorrect. This would occur if lactose were required for repression, which is the opposite of normal lac operon function.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The mutation prevents lactose from inactivating the repressor, leaving the repressor permanently bound to the operator. Even with low glucose (favoring CAP activation), the operon remains repressed. Thus, the lac operon genes are not expressed under any circumstances.  

**My final selection is: Option 2**
