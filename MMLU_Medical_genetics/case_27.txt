**1. Question Analysis**
- The question is assessing knowledge of enzyme replacement therapies used in specific genetic disorders. It requires identifying which genetic disease is treated with recombinant alpha-iduronidase, focusing on the relationship between enzyme deficiencies and their corresponding therapies.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**
- **Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT):** A treatment approach for certain lysosomal storage disorders where the deficient enzyme is supplemented.
- **Recombinant Alpha-Iduronidase:** A synthetic form of the enzyme alpha-iduronidase used in ERT.
- **Genetic Disorders Involved:**
  - **Hurler Syndrome (Mucopolysaccharidosis I):** Caused by mutations in the IDUA gene leading to deficient alpha-iduronidase.
  - **Fabry Disease:** Caused by mutations in the GLA gene leading to deficient alpha-galactosidase A.
  - **Gaucher Disease:** Caused by mutations in the GBA gene leading to deficient glucocerebrosidase.
  - **Pompe Disease:** Caused by mutations in the GAA gene leading to deficient acid alpha-glucosidase.
- **Inheritance Patterns:** Most of these disorders are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, except Fabry disease, which is X-linked recessive.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Fabry Disease**
   - **Incorrect.** Fabry disease is treated with recombinant alpha-galactosidase A, not alpha-iduronidase.
2. **Gaucher Disease**
   - **Incorrect.** Gaucher disease is treated with recombinant glucocerebrosidase (e.g., imiglucerase), not alpha-iduronidase.
3. **Hurler Syndrome**
   - **Correct.** Hurler syndrome is directly treated with recombinant alpha-iduronidase as it addresses the specific enzyme deficiency.
4. **Pompe Disease**
   - **Incorrect.** Pompe disease is treated with recombinant acid alpha-glucosidase (e.g., alglucosidase alfa), not alpha-iduronidase.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which disease is treated with recombinant alpha-iduronidase. This requires knowledge of enzyme replacement therapies (ERT) for lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs), specifically linking the enzyme name to its associated genetic deficiency and corresponding disorder.

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- **Lysosomal Storage Disorders (LSDs)**: These are inherited metabolic disorders caused by enzyme deficiencies leading to accumulation of substrates in lysosomes. Treatment often involves ERT.  
- **Alpha-iduronidase**: This enzyme is critical for breaking down glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Its deficiency leads to an LSD characterized by GAG buildup.  
- **Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS)**: A group of LSDs caused by GAG-processing enzyme deficiencies. **MPS I** is caused by alpha-iduronidase deficiency and includes Hurler, Scheie, and Hurler-Scheie syndromes as its clinical subtypes.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Fabry disease)**: Caused by deficiency of **alpha-galactosidase A**, not alpha-iduronidase. Treated with recombinant alpha-galactosidase. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 2 (Gaucher disease)**: Caused by deficiency of **glucocerebrosidase**, not alpha-iduronidase. Treated with imiglucerase or other glucocerebrosidase products. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 3 (Hurler syndrome)**: A subtype of **MPS I**, caused by **alpha-iduronidase deficiency**. Recombinant alpha-iduronidase (e.g., laronidase) is used in ERT for MPS I. **Correct**.  
- **Option 4 (Pompe disease)**: Caused by deficiency of **acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA)**, not alpha-iduronidase. Treated with alglucosidase alfa. **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  

Hurler syndrome (MPS I) is caused by alpha-iduronidase deficiency, and recombinant alpha-iduronidase (e.g., laronidase) is the approved ERT for this disorder. The other options involve deficiencies in distinct enzymes unrelated to alpha-iduronidase.

**1. Question Analysis**

**2. Key Genetic Considerations**  
- Lysosomal storage disorders are caused by deficiencies in specific lysosomal enzymes.  
- **Alpha-iduronidase** is the enzyme deficient in **Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I)**, which includes **Hurler syndrome**. ERT using recombinant alpha-iduronidase (e.g., laronidase) addresses this deficiency.  
- Other options involve distinct enzyme deficiencies:  
  - **Fabry disease**: Alpha-galactosidase A deficiency.  
  - **Gaucher disease**: Beta-glucocerebrosidase deficiency.  
  - **Pompe disease**: Acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) deficiency.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Fabry disease)**: Incorrect. Fabry disease is treated with recombinant alpha-galactosidase A (e.g., agalsidase).  
- **Option 2 (Gaucher disease)**: Incorrect. Gaucher disease uses recombinant beta-glucocerebrosidase (e.g., imiglucerase).  
- **Option 3 (Hurler syndrome)**: Correct. Hurler syndrome (MPS I) is treated with recombinant alpha-iduronidase.  
- **Option 4 (Pompe disease)**: Incorrect. Pompe disease is treated with recombinant acid alpha-glucosidase (e.g., alglucosidase alfa).  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  
- Hurler syndrome (MPS I) directly results from alpha-iduronidase deficiency, and recombinant alpha-iduronidase is the specific ERT for this disorder. Other options involve enzymes unrelated to alpha-iduronidase.
