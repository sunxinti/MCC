**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is asking which disease is associated with the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene. It requires understanding the role of APOE gene variants in various diseases.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- The APOE gene has three major alleles: ε2, ε3, and ε4.  
- The ε4 allele of APOE is a well-established genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, influencing the pathology and progression of the disease.  
- APOE is involved in lipid metabolism, neuronal repair, and amyloid-beta aggregation, which are relevant in neurodegenerative conditions.  
- The other listed diseases have different genetic associations:  
  - Cystic fibrosis is linked to mutations in the CFTR gene.  
  - Huntington's disease is caused by mutations in the HTT gene.  
  - Depression has multifactorial causes, including genetic, environmental, and psychological factors, but APOE is not a primary genetic risk factor.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Cystic fibrosis.**  
   - Incorrect. Cystic fibrosis is primarily associated with mutations in the CFTR gene, not the APOE gene.
2. **Huntington's dementia.**  
   - Incorrect. Huntington's disease is linked to mutations in the HTT gene, not the APOE gene.
3. **Alzheimer's disease.**  
   - Correct. The APOE ε4 allele is a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, influencing its onset and progression.
4. **Depression.**  
   - Incorrect. While depression has genetic components, the APOE gene is not a primary risk factor for depression.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which disease is associated with the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene. It requires knowledge of genetic associations with specific diseases, particularly focusing on APOE's role in neurodegenerative or metabolic conditions.  

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **APOE Gene Function**: APOE encodes apolipoprotein E, critical for lipid metabolism and cholesterol transport. It also plays roles in neuronal repair and amyloid-beta clearance in the brain.  
- **Genetic Variants**: Common alleles include ε2, ε3, and ε4. The ε4 allele is strongly linked to increased risk of **late-onset Alzheimer’s disease**, while ε2 may confer some protective benefit.  
- **Disease Associations**: APOE ε4 is the most significant genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. Other diseases, such as hyperlipidemia or age-related macular degeneration, are also linked but not listed here.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Cystic fibrosis)**: Caused by mutations in the **CFTR gene**, unrelated to APOE. Incorrect.  
- **Option 2 (Huntington's dementia)**: Refers to **Huntington’s disease**, caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the **HTT gene**. Incorrect.  
- **Option 3 (Alzheimer's disease)**: Strongly associated with the **APOE ε4 allele**, which increases risk for late-onset Alzheimer’s. Correct.  
- **Option 4 (Depression)**: While genetic factors contribute to depression, APOE is not a primary risk gene for this condition. Incorrect.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  
APOE ε4 is the most well-established genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease. The other options are linked to entirely different genetic mutations, making Alzheimer’s disease the correct answer.

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks which disease is associated with the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene. This requires knowledge of genetic predispositions to specific diseases.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- ApoE is a gene involved in lipid metabolism. The ApoE ε4 allele is a well-established genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease.  
- Other diseases listed (cystic fibrosis, Huntington's dementia, depression) are linked to distinct genetic or multifactorial etiologies unrelated to ApoE.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Cystic fibrosis):** Caused by mutations in the *CFTR* gene. No association with ApoE. **Incorrect.**  
- **Option 2 (Huntington's dementia):** Caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the *HTT* gene. ApoE is not implicated. **Incorrect.**  
- **Option 3 (Alzheimer's disease):** ApoE ε4 allele significantly increases the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, making this the strongest association. **Correct.**  
- **Option 4 (Depression):** While genetic factors contribute, no direct causal link exists between ApoE and depression. **Incorrect.**  

**4. Final Selection**  
The ApoE ε4 allele is a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, distinguishing it from the other options.  

**My final selection is: Option 3**
