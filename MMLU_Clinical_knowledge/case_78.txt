**1. Question Analysis**
- The question is assessing knowledge of hormonal regulation of nutrient uptake in muscle tissue, specifically which substance facilitates the uptake of glucose and amino acids into muscle cells.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**
- **Insulin** is a key anabolic hormone that promotes the uptake of glucose and amino acids into cells, especially muscle and adipose tissue, by facilitating the translocation of glucose transporters to the cell membrane.
- **Adrenaline** (epinephrine) is a catabolic hormone that generally increases blood glucose levels by promoting glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, opposite to insulin's effects.
- **Glycogen** is a storage form of glucose in liver and muscle tissues and does not actively promote nutrient uptake.
- **Cortisol** is a glucocorticoid that promotes gluconeogenesis and can lead to protein catabolism in muscle, antagonizing insulin's effects.

**3. Analysis of Options**
- **Option 1: Adrenaline**
  - Incorrect. Adrenaline increases blood glucose by promoting glycogen breakdown and does not facilitate glucose or amino acid uptake into muscles.
- **Option 2: Insulin**
  - Correct. Insulin promotes the uptake of glucose and amino acids into muscle cells by increasing the number of glucose transporters and facilitating amino acid transport.
- **Option 3: Glycogen**
  - Incorrect. Glycogen serves as a storage form of glucose and does not play a direct role in promoting nutrient uptake into muscles.
- **Option 4: Cortisol**
  - Incorrect. Cortisol promotes gluconeogenesis and protein catabolism, which opposes the uptake of glucose and amino acids into muscles.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which substance promotes the uptake of glucose and amino acids into muscle cells. This requires understanding the roles of hormones and metabolic molecules in regulating nutrient transport into muscle tissue.  

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **Insulin**: A hormone secreted by pancreatic β-cells that facilitates glucose uptake into muscle and adipose tissue via translocation of GLUT4 transporters. It also enhances amino acid uptake for protein synthesis.  
- **Adrenaline (Epinephrine)**: A catecholamine that mobilizes energy stores (e.g., glycogen breakdown) and inhibits glucose uptake into muscle during stress.  
- **Glycogen**: A storage form of glucose in muscles and liver; it does not directly promote nutrient uptake but is broken down into glucose when needed.  
- **Cortisol**: A glucocorticoid that increases blood glucose via gluconeogenesis and protein catabolism while reducing glucose uptake into muscle (insulin resistance).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Adrenaline)**: Incorrect. Adrenaline decreases glucose uptake into muscle by inhibiting GLUT4 translocation and promotes glycogen breakdown, opposing nutrient uptake.  
- **Option 2 (Insulin)**: Correct. Insulin directly stimulates glucose uptake via GLUT4 and enhances amino acid transport into muscle for anabolic processes.  
- **Option 3 (Glycogen)**: Incorrect. Glycogen is a stored energy molecule, not a signaling molecule to promote nutrient uptake.  
- **Option 4 (Cortisol)**: Incorrect. Cortisol reduces glucose and amino acid uptake into muscle by inducing insulin resistance and promoting catabolism.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks which option promotes **glucose and amino acid uptake by muscle cells**. This involves understanding the hormonal regulation of nutrient transport into muscle tissue.  

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **Insulin** is a peptide hormone secreted by pancreatic β-cells. Its primary role is to lower blood glucose by facilitating cellular uptake (via GLUT4 transporters in muscle and adipose tissue) and promoting glycogen synthesis.  
- Insulin also stimulates **amino acid uptake** into muscle cells, enhancing protein synthesis and inhibiting proteolysis.  
- Other hormones like adrenaline (epinephrine) and cortisol act counter to insulin, increasing blood glucose through catabolic processes (e.g., glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis).  
- Glycogen is a glucose storage polymer, not a hormone, and does not directly regulate nutrient uptake.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Adrenaline**  
  - **Incorrect**. Adrenaline increases blood glucose via glycogenolysis (liver) and lipolysis (adipose), preparing the body for "fight-or-flight." It **reduces glucose uptake** in muscles during stress by prioritizing glucose for immediate energy.  

- **Option 2: Insulin**  
  - **Correct**. Insulin binds to receptors on muscle cells, triggering translocation of GLUT4 transporters to the cell membrane, enabling glucose uptake. It also activates signaling pathways (e.g., PI3K/Akt) that enhance amino acid transporter activity (e.g., SNAT2), promoting amino acid uptake.  

- **Option 3: Glycogen**  
  - **Incorrect**. Glycogen is a stored form of glucose in liver and muscle. It does not regulate nutrient uptake; instead, it is synthesized (via insulin) or broken down (via adrenaline/glucagon).  

- **Option 4: Cortisol**  
  - **Incorrect**. Cortisol increases blood glucose via gluconeogenesis and proteolysis (releasing amino acids for gluconeogenesis). It antagonizes insulin, reducing glucose uptake in peripheral tissues.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  
- Insulin is the only hormone listed that directly stimulates **both glucose and amino acid uptake** in muscle cells, aligning with its anabolic role in nutrient storage and utilization postprandially. Other options either oppose insulin’s effects or lack direct regulatory roles in nutrient transport.
