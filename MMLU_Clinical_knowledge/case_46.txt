**1. Question Analysis**
- The question is assessing the understanding of the structural composition of double-stranded DNA, specifically the ratio of purines to pyrimidines. This relates to the fundamental principles of DNA base pairing and molecular genetics.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**
- **Purines and Pyrimidines**: In DNA, purines (adenine [A] and guanine [G]) pair with pyrimidines (thymine [T] and cytosine [C]) through hydrogen bonds, maintaining the DNA's double-helix structure.
- **Base Pairing Rule (Chargaff's Rules)**: Erwin Chargaff discovered that in DNA, the amount of adenine equals thymine, and the amount of guanine equals cytosine. This implies a stoichiometric balance between purines and pyrimidines.
- **Genetic Stability**: The 1:1 ratio ensures the stability and uniformity of the DNA structure, which is crucial for accurate DNA replication and transcription processes.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Variable.**
   - *Incorrect.* The ratio of purines to pyrimidines in double-stranded DNA is not variable; it is fixed due to base-pairing rules.
2. **Determined by the base sequence in RNA.**
   - *Incorrect.* RNA does not determine the purine-pyrimidine ratio in DNA. Instead, DNA dictates RNA sequences during transcription.
3. **Genetically determined.**
   - *Partially Correct.* While the specific sequence of purines and pyrimidines is genetically determined, the overall ratio in double-stranded DNA is fixed at 1:1 due to base-pairing rules, not varying based on genetic content.
4. **Always 1:1.**
   - *Correct.* In double-stranded DNA, the number of purines equals the number of pyrimidines, maintaining a consistent 1:1 ratio as per Chargaff's rules.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks about the ratio of purines to pyrimidines in a double-stranded DNA molecule. This requires understanding DNA structure, base pairing rules, and Chargaff's rules.  

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **Purines vs. Pyrimidines**: In DNA, purines (adenine [A], guanine [G]) pair with pyrimidines (thymine [T], cytosine [C]).  
- **Chargaff's Rules**: In double-stranded DNA, the amount of adenine equals thymine (A = T), and guanine equals cytosine (G = C).  
- **Base Pairing**: Each purine on one strand pairs with a pyrimidine on the complementary strand. Thus, the total number of purines (A + G) equals the total number of pyrimidines (T + C) in the entire DNA molecule.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (variable)**: Incorrect. According to Chargaff's rules and base pairing, the ratio is fixed, not variable.  
- **Option 2 (determined by RNA's base sequence)**: Incorrect. DNA's purine-pyrimidine ratio is determined by its own structure, not RNA. RNA is transcribed from DNA but does not dictate the DNA's base composition.  
- **Option 3 (genetically determined)**: Incorrect. While the specific sequence of bases is genetic, the 1:1 ratio of purines to pyrimidines is a structural consequence of base pairing, not genetic determination.  
- **Option 4 (always 1:1)**: Correct. Due to complementary base pairing (A-T and G-C), the total purines (A + G) must equal the total pyrimidines (T + C) in double-stranded DNA, resulting in a 1:1 ratio.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  
The ratio of purines to pyrimidines in double-stranded DNA is **always 1:1** due to the complementary base pairing rules (A-T and G-C), which ensure equal numbers of purines and pyrimidines across both strands.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks about the ratio of purines to pyrimidines in a double-stranded DNA molecule. This requires understanding the structural pairing rules of DNA bases and how they influence this ratio.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **DNA Structure**: DNA is a double helix with complementary base pairing: adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T), and guanine (G) pairs with cytosine (C).  
- **Purines vs. Pyrimidines**: Purines (A and G) are two-ring structures, while pyrimidines (T and C) are single-ring structures.  
- **Chargaff's Rules**: In double-stranded DNA, the amount of A equals T, and G equals C. Consequently, the total number of purines (A + G) equals the total number of pyrimidines (T + C) in the entire molecule.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (variable)**: Incorrect. The ratio is not variable; it is fixed at 1:1 due to complementary base pairing.  
- **Option 2 (determined by RNA base sequence)**: Incorrect. DNA’s purine:pyrimidine ratio is intrinsic to its structure and unrelated to RNA.  
- **Option 3 (genetically determined)**: Incorrect. While the genetic sequence varies, the 1:1 ratio is a universal structural requirement, not influenced by genetic content.  
- **Option 4 (always 1:1)**: Correct. Complementary pairing ensures equal numbers of purines and pyrimidines in double-stranded DNA.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  
The 1:1 ratio is a fundamental property of double-stranded DNA due to strict base pairing (A-T and G-C). This structural necessity ensures the ratio remains constant regardless of genetic sequence.
