**1. Question Analysis**
- The question is assessing the understanding of haemorrhoids, specifically identifying which statement about haemorrhoids is accurate. It requires knowledge of the clinical features, risk factors, and classifications of haemorrhoids.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**
- **Haemorrhoids Overview:** Haemorrhoids are swollen vascular structures in the anal canal, which can be internal or external.
- **Classification:** They are classified into four grades:
  - **First-degree:** Internal haemorrhoids that bleed but do not prolapse.
  - **Second-degree:** Internal haemorrhoids that prolapse during straining but retract spontaneously.
  - **Third-degree:** Haemorrhoids that prolapse and require manual reduction.
  - **Fourth-degree:** Haemorrhoids that are prolapsed and cannot be manually reduced.
- **Predisposing Factors:**
  - Increased intra-abdominal pressure (e.g., pregnancy, obesity)
  - Chronic constipation or diarrhea
  - Prolonged sitting
- **Symptoms:**
  - Painless rectal bleeding (typically bright red) for internal haemorrhoids
  - Pain and swelling for external haemorrhoids

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Bleeding haemorrhoids lead to melaena per rectum (PR):**
   - **Incorrect.** Haemorrhoidal bleeding typically presents as bright red blood per rectum. Melaena, which is black and tarry, usually indicates upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
   
2. **Pregnancy is a predisposing factor in causing haemorrhoids:**
   - **Correct.** Pregnancy increases intra-abdominal pressure and hormonal changes, which can contribute to the development of haemorrhoids.
   
3. **Bleeding from first degree haemorrhoids is associated with pain:**
   - **Incorrect.** First-degree haemorrhoids are internal and generally not painful. Pain is more commonly associated with external haemorrhoids or prolapsed internal haemorrhoids that become thrombosed.
   
4. **Second degree haemorrhoids cannot be returned to the anal canal:**
   - **Incorrect.** Second-degree haemorrhoids prolapse during straining but typically retract spontaneously without intervention. They can also often be manually reduced.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks which statement about haemorrhoids is true. It focuses on clinical characteristics, pathophysiology, and classification of haemorrhoids.  

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **Haemorrhoid Classification**:  
  - **First-degree**: Painless, do not prolapse.  
  - **Second-degree**: Prolapse during straining but reduce spontaneously.  
  - **Third-degree**: Prolapse but require manual reduction.  
  - **Fourth-degree**: Prolapse and cannot be reduced, often with complications.  
- **Bleeding**: Internal haemorrhoids (above the dentate line) typically cause painless bright red blood per rectum. External haemorrhoids (below the dentate line) may cause pain if thrombosed.  
- **Predisposing Factors**: Increased intra-abdominal pressure (e.g., pregnancy, chronic constipation, obesity).  
- **Melaena**: Dark, tarry stools indicate upper gastrointestinal bleeding, not haemorrhoids.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Incorrect. Haemorrhoids cause bright red blood (not melaena), as they involve lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Melaena suggests upper GI bleeding (e.g., peptic ulcer, gastritis).  
- **Option 2**: Correct. Pregnancy increases intra-abdominal pressure and relaxes smooth muscles (due to progesterone), predisposing to haemorrhoids.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. First-degree haemorrhoids (internal) are painless, even when bleeding. Pain with bleeding suggests external haemorrhoids or an anal fissure.  
- **Option 4**: Incorrect. Second-degree haemorrhoids prolapse but reduce spontaneously. Inability to return characterizes third- or fourth-degree haemorrhoids.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question assesses knowledge of hemorrhoids, focusing on their clinical features, predisposing factors, and classification. It requires differentiating between hemorrhoid grades, associated symptoms, and risk factors.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **Hemorrhoid classification**:  
  - **1st degree**: Internal, no prolapse.  
  - **2nd degree**: Prolapse during defecation, reduce spontaneously.  
  - **3rd degree**: Prolapse requiring manual reduction.  
  - **4th degree**: Irreducible prolapse.  
- **Bleeding characteristics**: Bright red blood per rectum (not melena, which is from upper GI bleeding).  
- **Pain**: Internal hemorrhoids (above the dentate line) are painless due to visceral innervation; pain arises from external hemorrhoids or complications (e.g., thrombosis).  
- **Risk factors**: Pregnancy (increased intra-abdominal pressure, hormonal changes, constipation).

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Incorrect. Melaena involves digested blood (black, tarry stools), typical of upper GI bleeding. Hemorrhoids cause bright red rectal bleeding.  
- **Option 2**: Correct. Pregnancy is a well-established risk factor due to pressure on pelvic veins and hormonal effects.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. First-degree hemorrhoids bleed painlessly; pain suggests external hemorrhoids or other anal pathology (e.g., fissure).  
- **Option 4**: Incorrect. Second-degree hemorrhoids prolapse but reduce spontaneously. Non-reducible prolapse defines third- or fourth-degree hemorrhoids.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  
Pregnancy is a predisposing factor for hemorrhoids due to increased intra-abdominal pressure and hormonal changes, making Option 2 the only accurate statement. Other options contradict core clinical principles regarding bleeding characteristics, pain mechanisms, and hemorrhoid classification.
