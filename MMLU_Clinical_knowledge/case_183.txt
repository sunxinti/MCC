**1. Question Analysis**
- The question is inquiring about the maximum duration a cannula (likely a peripheral intravenous cannula) can remain in place (in situ) before it should be replaced or removed. This pertains to infection control, patient safety, and best clinical practices regarding intravenous therapy.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**
- **Peripheral Intravenous Cannula (PIVC) Maintenance:** PIVCs are commonly used for short-term intravenous access. The duration a PIVC can remain in place depends on several factors, including the type of cannula, site used, patient condition, and adherence to aseptic techniques.
- **Infection Risk:** Prolonged use of a cannula increases the risk of local site infections and bloodstream infections. Guidelines aim to minimize these risks by recommending appropriate replacement intervals.
- **Guidelines and Recommendations:** Various health organizations provide guidelines on PIVC duration. While some guidelines suggest changing cannulas every 72-96 hours, others recommend assessment-based replacement rather than routine replacement, provided the cannula remains functional and without signs of infection.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **24 hours:** This duration is shorter than most standard recommendations. Routine replacement every 24 hours is generally not required unless there are specific indications like infection or infiltration.
2. **36 hours:** Similar to the 24-hour mark, 36 hours is shorter than typical guidelines. Routine replacement at this interval is uncommon unless clinical conditions warrant it.
3. **48 hours:** This duration aligns more closely with some institutional protocols that recommend changing PIVCs every 48-72 hours to balance infection risk and patient comfort.
4. **96 hours:** This extends to 4 days, which is within the upper range of many guidelines that allow PIVCs to remain in place for up to 72-96 hours, provided there are no signs of complications and the cannula remains functional.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks about the maximum duration a cannula (peripheral intravenous catheter) can safely remain in place. It requires knowledge of clinical guidelines and evidence-based practices to prevent complications like infection, phlebitis, and thrombosis associated with prolonged catheter use.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **Catheter-Related Complications**: Prolonged cannula use increases risks of phlebitis, infiltration, thrombosis, and bloodstream infections.  
- **Guideline Recommendations**: The Infusion Nurses Society (INS) and other organizations provide evidence-based recommendations for catheter dwell time.  
- **Standard Practice**: Peripheral IV catheters are typically removed and replaced if they are no longer needed or if complications arise. The INS guidelines suggest that peripheral cannulas should not remain in place for more than **96 hours** to minimize complications.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (24 hours)**: Incorrect. This duration is excessively short and unnecessary unless complications arise. Guidelines do not support such a short dwell time.  
- **Option 2 (36 hours)**: Incorrect. No major clinical guidelines recommend this as a maximum duration.  
- **Option 3 (48 hours)**: Incorrect. While some institutions may use this timeframe, it is shorter than the widely accepted 72–96-hour recommendation.  
- **Option 4 (96 hours)**: Correct. This aligns with INS guidelines, which state that peripheral IV catheters should be removed or replaced every 72–96 hours to reduce infection and phlebitis risks unless complications necessitate earlier removal.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  

The recommendation for a cannula’s maximum dwell time is **96 hours**, as supported by evidence-based guidelines like those from the Infusion Nurses Society. This duration balances clinical safety and practicality while minimizing complications.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks for the maximum recommended duration a cannula (peripheral intravenous catheter) can remain in situ before requiring replacement to minimize complications.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **Infection and Phlebitis Risk**: Prolonged cannulation increases the risk of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) and phlebitis.  
- **Guidelines**: The CDC recommends replacing peripheral intravenous catheters no more frequently than every **72–96 hours** in adults, provided no signs of complications (e.g., redness, swelling, pain) are present.  
- **Clinical Judgment**: Duration may vary based on local protocols, patient condition, and catheter site integrity.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (24 hours)**: Incorrect. Replacing cannulas every 24 hours is unnecessarily frequent and not supported by guidelines, increasing costs and patient discomfort.  
- **Option 2 (36 hours)**: Incorrect. No evidence supports 36 hours as a standard; this timeframe does not align with major guidelines.  
- **Option 3 (48 hours)**: Incorrect. While some older practices may use 48–72 hours, current CDC guidelines extend this to 96 hours when no complications are present.  
- **Option 4 (96 hours)**: Correct. CDC guidelines explicitly state that peripheral catheters can remain in situ for up to 96 hours in uncomplicated cases, balancing access needs and infection prevention.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  
The CDC’s evidence-based recommendation supports 96 hours as the maximum duration for peripheral cannulas in adults without complications, making this the most accurate answer.
