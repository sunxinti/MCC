**1. Question Analysis**  
The question is assessing the clinical features and epidemiology of Systemic Sclerosis (also known as systemic scleroderma). It requires identifying which statement among the options accurately reflects the characteristics of this autoimmune connective tissue disease.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
Systemic Sclerosis is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by fibrosis of the skin and internal organs, vasculopathy, and autoantibody production. Key clinical features include:
- Predominantly affects females more than males.
- Presence of specific skin changes such as skin thickening, tightness, and a waxy appearance.
- Vascular manifestations like Raynaud's phenomenon and telangiectasia.
- Unlike other connective tissue diseases, features such as arachnodactyly are more associated with Marfan syndrome, and a beaked nose is not a typical feature of Systemic Sclerosis.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **It affects males more than females**  
   - **Incorrect.** Systemic Sclerosis is more common in females, with a female-to-male ratio of approximately 4:1.

2. **If telangiectasia are seen this clinches the diagnosis**  
   - **Incorrect.** While telangiectasia can be a feature of Systemic Sclerosis, especially in the limited cutaneous form (e.g., CREST syndrome), they are not pathognomonic and thus do not by themselves clinch the diagnosis.

3. **Arachnodactyly is a feature of the disease**  
   - **Incorrect.** Arachnodactyly (long, slender fingers) is typically associated with Marfan syndrome, not Systemic Sclerosis.

4. **Patients have a beaked shaped nose and waxy skin**  
   - **Correct.** A beaked nose and waxy skin are characteristic features of Systemic Sclerosis. The skin becomes tight and shiny, and facial features can become mask-like with a beaked or pinched appearance.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks which statement about Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) is true. The options relate to demographics, diagnostic criteria, physical exam findings, and clinical features.  

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **Demographics**: SSc predominantly affects females (approximately 4:1 female-to-male ratio).  
- **Telangiectasia**: These are common in SSc but are not pathognomonic (exclusive) to the disease. They can occur in other conditions like lupus or rosacea.  
- **Arachnodactyly**: A long, slender finger configuration seen in conditions like Marfan syndrome, not SSc.  
- **Beaked nose and waxy skin**: Classic features of SSc due to skin fibrosis and tightening, leading to facial changes and a characteristic waxy, shiny skin texture.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Incorrect. SSc affects females more than males.  
- **Option 2**: Incorrect. Telangiectasia are common in SSc but do not "clinch the diagnosis" alone.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. Arachnodactyly is unrelated to SSc; the disease causes sclerodactyly (swollen, tight fingers) instead.  
- **Option 4**: Correct. The beaked-shaped nose and waxy skin are hallmark features of SSc due to skin fibrosis and facial involvement.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which statement about Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) is true, focusing on clinical features, epidemiology, and diagnostic criteria. It requires distinguishing accurate characteristics of SSc from those of other conditions.  

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **Epidemiology**: SSc has a strong female predominance (female-to-male ratio ~4:1).  
- **Clinical Features**:  
  - **Telangiectasia**: Common in limited cutaneous SSc (CREST syndrome) but not pathognomonic (e.g., also seen in HHT or liver disease).  
  - **Arachnodactyly**: Long, slender fingers are classic in Marfan syndrome, not SSc (SSc causes sclerodactyly).  
  - **Facial/Skin Changes**: Tight, thickened skin leads to a "mask-like" face, thin lips, and radial furrowing. A "beaked nose" may occur due to skin tightening, and skin often appears waxy or shiny from fibrosis.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Incorrect. SSc affects females more than males.  
- **Option 2**: Incorrect. Telangiectasia supports but does not "clinch" the diagnosis, as they are nonspecific.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. Arachnodactyly is a feature of Marfan syndrome, not SSc.  
- **Option 4**: Correct. Skin fibrosis in SSc causes a waxy appearance, and facial skin tightening can lead to a pinched or "beaked" nose.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  
Systemic Sclerosis is associated with skin fibrosis and facial changes, including a beaked nose and waxy skin. Other options are inconsistent with SSc’s epidemiology (female predominance), nonspecificity of telangiectasia, and misattribution of arachnodactyly to SSc.
