**1. Question Analysis**  
The question is inquiring about a specific component found in saliva that possesses antibacterial properties. It requires identifying which of the listed substances contributes to the antibacterial action within saliva.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
Saliva contains various enzymes and substances that play roles in digestion, lubrication, and oral health. Among these, certain components have antimicrobial functions that help in controlling bacterial populations in the mouth, thereby preventing infections and maintaining oral hygiene. Understanding the functions of these components is crucial in identifying which one has antibacterial action.

**3. Analysis of Options**

1. **Lysozyme**  
   Lysozyme is an enzyme present in saliva that has antibacterial properties. It works by breaking down the cell walls of bacteria, leading to their destruction. This makes lysozyme a key player in the innate immune defense of the oral cavity.

2. **Amylase**  
   Amylase is an enzyme in saliva that initiates the digestion of starches by breaking them down into simpler sugars. While it is essential for digestion, it does not have antibacterial properties.

3. **Sodium chloride**  
   Sodium chloride, or common salt, is present in saliva and helps maintain osmotic balance and electrolyte composition. However, it does not have direct antibacterial action in the context of saliva.

4. **Mucus**  
   Mucus in saliva serves to lubricate the oral cavity, facilitating speech and swallowing. While it can trap some microorganisms, its primary function is not antibacterial action.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which component of saliva possesses antibacterial properties. It requires knowledge of the biochemical and immunological functions of saliva, focusing on its defensive roles against pathogens.  

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
Saliva contains several components with antibacterial actions, including enzymes, antibodies, and other molecules. Lysozyme is a well-known enzyme that disrupts bacterial cell walls. Other components like immunoglobulins (e.g., IgA) also contribute, but they are not listed here. Understanding the primary functions of each option is critical:  
- **Lysozyme**: Enzyme that hydrolyzes bacterial cell walls.  
- **Amylase**: Digestive enzyme breaking down starch.  
- **Sodium chloride**: Electrolyte with minimal direct antibacterial activity.  
- **Mucus**: Forms a physical barrier but lacks direct bactericidal properties.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Lysozyme):** Correct. Lysozyme is an enzyme in saliva that specifically hydrolyzes the peptidoglycan layer of bacterial cell walls, directly killing bacteria.  
- **Option 2 (Amylase):** Incorrect. Amylase is a digestive enzyme that breaks down carbohydrates; it has no antibacterial role.  
- **Option 3 (Sodium chloride):** Incorrect. While present in saliva, NaCl primarily contributes to osmotic balance and electrolyte homeostasis, not antibacterial defense.  
- **Option 4 (Mucus):** Incorrect. Mucus forms a physical barrier to trap pathogens but does not directly kill bacteria. Its role is passive defense, not antibacterial action.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**

选择: 选项 1 (Lysozyme.)

DeepSeek的完整回答:
================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks which component of saliva has antibacterial properties. It tests knowledge of salivary constituents and their physiological roles.  

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- Saliva contains multiple components with distinct functions:  
  - **Lysozyme**: An enzyme that lyses bacterial cell walls by hydrolyzing peptidoglycan, providing innate immune defense.  
  - **Amylase**: A digestive enzyme that breaks down starch into sugars (no antibacterial role).  
  - **Sodium chloride**: Maintains electrolyte balance; insufficient concentration in saliva to exert antibacterial effects.  
  - **Mucus**: Lubricates and protects mucosal surfaces but lacks direct antibacterial activity.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Lysozyme)**: Correct. Directly targets bacterial cell walls, making it a key antibacterial agent in saliva.  
- **Option 2 (Amylase)**: Incorrect. Involved in carbohydrate digestion, not immune defense.  
- **Option 3 (Sodium chloride)**: Incorrect. Electrolyte role; no significant antibacterial action at salivary concentrations.  
- **Option 4 (Mucus)**: Incorrect. Acts as a physical barrier but does not chemically neutralize bacteria.  

**4. Final Selection**  
- Lysozyme (Option 1) is the only component listed that directly exerts antibacterial effects via enzymatic degradation of bacterial cell walls.  

**My final selection is: Option 1**
