**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is assessing the understanding of various aspects of headaches, including their causes, associations, and clinical presentations. It requires the identification of the statement that is true regarding headaches based on clinical medical knowledge.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **Headache Types:** Understanding different types of headaches such as tension-type, migraines, cluster headaches, and secondary headaches caused by underlying conditions.
- **Neck Stiffness:** Neck stiffness can be a symptom of meningitis but is not exclusively caused by it; other conditions like subarachnoid hemorrhage can also present with neck stiffness.
- **Severe Headache:** While severe headache can indicate life-threatening conditions like subarachnoid hemorrhage or meningitis, it can also be present in non-threatening conditions like migraines.
- **Temporal Arteritis:** Also known as giant cell arteritis, it is more commonly associated with polymyalgia rheumatica rather than rheumatoid arthritis.
- **Prevalence of Tension Headaches:** Tension-type headaches are the most common type of headache experienced by individuals.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **When associated with neck stiffness is always due to meningitis**  
   - **Incorrect:** Neck stiffness can be caused by meningitis but is not exclusively due to it. Other conditions like subarachnoid hemorrhage can also present with neck stiffness.

2. **Severe pain usually indicates a life threatening cause**  
   - **Incorrect:** While severe headache can be associated with life-threatening conditions, it is not always the case. Non-life-threatening conditions like migraines can also present with severe pain.

3. **Temporal arteritis is strongly associated with rheumatoid arthritis**  
   - **Incorrect:** Temporal arteritis is more strongly associated with polymyalgia rheumatica rather than rheumatoid arthritis.

4. **Tension headaches is a common cause of headache**  
   - **Correct:** Tension-type headaches are indeed the most common type of headaches experienced by individuals.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which statement about headaches is true. It requires knowledge of headache etiologies, associated symptoms, and clinical correlations.  

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **Neck stiffness** in headaches can arise from meningitis, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), or other causes.  
- **Severe headache** severity does not always equate to a life-threatening cause (e.g., migraine vs. SAH).  
- **Temporal arteritis** is linked to polymyalgia rheumatica, not rheumatoid arthritis.  
- **Tension-type headaches** are the most common primary headache disorder.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Incorrect. Neck stiffness with headache is not *always* meningitis. Other causes include SAH, subdural hematoma, or stiff neck from muscle spasm.  
- **Option 2**: Incorrect. Severe headaches (e.g., migraines) are often benign. Only a minority of severe headaches are life-threatening (e.g., SAH, meningitis).  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. Temporal arteritis is strongly associated with **polymyalgia rheumatica**, not rheumatoid arthritis.  
- **Option 4**: Correct. Tension-type headaches are the most common primary headache disorder, affecting a large proportion of the population.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

DeepSeek的完整回答:
================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question assesses knowledge of headache characteristics and their clinical associations.  
- It requires distinguishing true statements from common misconceptions regarding headache etiology and presentation.  

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **Meningitis vs. other causes of neck stiffness**: While neck stiffness is a hallmark of meningitis, subarachnoid hemorrhage or cervical spine pathology can also present similarly.  
- **Severity vs. clinical urgency**: Severe pain does not inherently indicate life-threatening causes (e.g., migraines are severe but benign). Conversely, subtle headaches may signal serious pathology (e.g., brain tumors).  
- **Temporal arteritis associations**: Linked to polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), not rheumatoid arthritis.  
- **Epidemiology of tension headaches**: Most prevalent headache type, characterized by bilateral, non-pulsatile pain without systemic symptoms.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Incorrect. Neck stiffness can occur in subarachnoid hemorrhage, cervical spondylosis, or even severe migraines. "Always" is inaccurate.  
- **Option 2**: Incorrect. Severe pain is not a definitive marker of life-threatening causes (e.g., migraines). Some dangerous causes (e.g., brain tumors) may present with mild pain.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. Temporal arteritis is strongly associated with PMR, not rheumatoid arthritis.  
- **Option 4**: Correct. Tension headaches are the most common primary headache disorder globally.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  
- Tension headaches are a prevalent cause of headache, affecting a large proportion of the population. This aligns with epidemiological data and clinical guidelines, making Option 4 the only accurate statement.
