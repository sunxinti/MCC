**1. Question Analysis**  
The question pertains to postoperative management following a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Specifically, it addresses the appropriate solution to use for bladder washout in the event of a blocked catheter three hours after the procedure, considering the context of irrigation used during TURP.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **TURP Syndrome:** A potential complication of TURP is the absorption of irrigation fluids, leading to electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
- **Irrigation Solutions:** The type of solution used for irrigation during TURP is crucial. Historically, non-electrolyte solutions like glycine (Solution G) were used, but they carry a risk of TURP syndrome if absorbed.
- **Bladder Washout Post-TURP:** Postoperative irrigation should use solutions that minimize the risk of electrolyte disturbances. Isotonic solutions with electrolytes, such as normal saline or Ringer's solution, are preferred to maintain serum electrolyte balance and prevent complications.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Solution R.**  
  *Assumption:* Likely refers to Ringer's solution.  
  *Evaluation:* Ringer's solution is isotonic and contains electrolytes, making it suitable for bladder washout post-TURP to minimize electrolyte imbalance risks.

- **Option 2: Normal saline.**  
  *Evaluation:* Normal saline is isotonic and also contains electrolytes, making it an appropriate choice for bladder irrigation post-TURP.

- **Option 3: Solution G.**  
  *Assumption:* Likely refers to glycine-based solutions.  
  *Evaluation:* Glycine is a non-electrolyte solution historically used for TURP irrigation but poses a risk for TURP syndrome if absorbed. It is less desirable for bladder washout in the postoperative setting due to this risk.

- **Option 4: Any of the above.**  
  *Evaluation:* Since Solution G poses risks, not all options are equally appropriate. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question focuses on postoperative management after a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Specifically, it asks which solution is appropriate for bladder washout when a catheter becomes blocked. Key considerations include the type of irrigation solutions used during and after TURP and their safety profiles.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **TURP Procedure Details**: During TURP, the surgical irrigation fluid is often hypertonic (e.g., glycine, sorbitol, or mannitol) to distend the bladder and provide a clear surgical field. However, these solutions can be absorbed into the bloodstream, leading to **TUR syndrome** (e.g., hyponatremia, hypervolemia).  
- **Postoperative Bladder Irrigation**: After surgery, the goal of bladder washout is to clear clots and debris while minimizing risks. The irrigation solution must be **isotonic** to prevent fluid absorption and associated complications.  
- **Standard Practice**: Post-TURP irrigation typically uses **normal saline (0.9% NaCl)**, an isotonic solution that is safe and effective for maintaining patency of the catheter without contributing to fluid overload or electrolyte imbalances.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Solution R)**: "Solution R" is not a standard term in this context. If it refers to Ringer’s lactate, it is an isotonic crystalloid but is not commonly used for bladder irrigation post-TURP. Its use here is unnecessary and less specific to the clinical scenario.  
- **Option 2 (Normal Saline)**: This is the standard choice for post-TURP bladder washout. It is isotonic, safe, and effective for clearing clots without risking fluid absorption.  
- **Option 3 (Solution G)**: Likely refers to glycine, a hypertonic solution used during TURP itself. Using glycine postoperatively is unsafe due to its risk of absorption and exacerbation of hyponatremia.  
- **Option 4 (Any of the above)**: Incorrect because Options 1 and 3 are either non-standard or unsafe in this scenario.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  
Normal saline is the correct choice because it is isotonic, safe for bladder irrigation, and avoids the risks associated with hypertonic solutions like glycine. Using normal saline minimizes complications while effectively addressing catheter blockage.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which solution should be used for bladder washout in a patient with a blocked catheter three hours after transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). This requires understanding the appropriate irrigation solutions post-TURP to prevent complications like hemolysis, electrolyte imbalances, or TURP syndrome.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- Post-TURP, continuous bladder irrigation (CBI) is often used to prevent catheter blockage from blood clots.  
- Hypotonic solutions (e.g., glycine) are used **during** TURP to avoid electrical conduction during electrocautery. However, **postoperatively**, isotonic solutions (e.g., normal saline) are preferred to prevent hypotonic fluid absorption, which can cause hyponatremia, TURP syndrome, or hemolysis.  
- Solution R (likely Ringer’s lactate) is isotonic but is not standard for post-TURP irrigation. Solution G (likely glycine) is hypotonic and contraindicated postoperatively.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Solution R):** While isotonic, Ringer’s lactate is not the standard solution for post-TURP bladder washout. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 2 (Normal saline):** Isotonic and safe for irrigation; prevents fluid absorption complications. **Correct**.  
- **Option 3 (Solution G):** Glycine is hypotonic and risks TURP syndrome if absorbed. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 4 (Any of the above):** Incorrect, as only normal saline is safe.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  
Normal saline is the only isotonic solution appropriate for post-TURP bladder washout, avoiding complications from hypotonic solutions. Solutions R and G are either non-standard or unsafe in this context.
