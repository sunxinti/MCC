**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks for a true statement regarding rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a chronic inflammatory disorder affecting joints. It requires identifying the accurate characteristic or clinical feature associated with RA from the provided options.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **Rheumatoid Factor (RF):** An antibody present in many RA patients but not all. Historically, RF positivity is associated with more severe disease.
- **Oligoarthropathy vs. Polyarthropathy:** Oligoarthritis involves a few joints, while polyarthritis affects many joints symmetrically, which is typical in RA.
- **Anemia in RA:** Chronic inflammation in RA can lead to anemia of chronic disease, making it a common finding.
- **Heberden's Nodes:** These are bony enlargements found in the distal interphalangeal joints, commonly associated with osteoarthritis, not RA.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Rheumatoid factor is present in 25% of rheumatoid cases**  
   - *Incorrect.* RF is present in approximately 70-80% of RA cases.
2. **It is an example of an oligoarthropathy**  
   - *Incorrect.* RA typically presents as a polyarthritis, affecting multiple joints.
3. **Anaemia is a common finding**  
   - *Correct.* Anemia of chronic disease is frequently seen in RA patients.
4. **Heberden's nodes are a feature**  
   - *Incorrect.* Heberden's nodes are characteristic of osteoarthritis, not RA.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which statement about rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is true. RA is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease primarily affecting joints, and the options involve serological markers, disease classification, common complications, and physical exam findings.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **Rheumatoid factor (RF):** Present in ~70-80% of RA cases (seropositive RA).  
- **Arthritis classification:** RA typically causes symmetric polyarthritis (involving >5 joints), not oligoarthropathy (<5 joints).  
- **Anemia:** Common in RA due to chronic inflammation (anemia of chronic disease).  
- **Heberden’s nodes:** Bony enlargements at distal interphalangeal joints, seen in osteoarthritis (OA), not RA.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1:** Incorrect. RF is present in ~70-80% of RA cases, not 25%.  
- **Option 2:** Incorrect. RA is a polyarthropathy, not an oligoarthropathy.  
- **Option 3:** Correct. Anemia is a frequent extramusal manifestation of RA due to chronic inflammation.  
- **Option 4:** Incorrect. Heberden’s nodes are specific to OA, not RA. RA often causes fusiform swelling of the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question assesses knowledge of key clinical features and characteristics of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It requires distinguishing RA from other joint disorders and recognizing associated laboratory/clinical findings.  

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **RA Pathophysiology**: Chronic systemic autoimmune disease primarily causing symmetric polyarthritis (small joints).  
- **Rheumatoid Factor (RF)**: Present in ~70-80% of cases (seropositive RA), not 25%.  
- **Joint Involvement**: RA is a *polyarthropathy* (≥5 joints), not oligoarthropathy (2–4 joints).  
- **Anemia in RA**: Chronic inflammation leads to anemia of chronic disease (common finding).  
- **Heberden’s Nodes**: Bony swellings at distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints, characteristic of osteoarthritis, not RA.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Incorrect. RF is present in ~70-80% of RA cases, not 25%.  
- **Option 2**: Incorrect. RA is a *polyarthropathy*; oligoarthropathy (e.g., reactive arthritis) affects fewer joints.  
- **Option 3**: Correct. Anemia of chronic disease is common due to prolonged inflammation.  
- **Option 4**: Incorrect. Heberden’s nodes are specific to osteoarthritis. RA typically involves proximal joints (PIP/MCP).  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  
- Anemia is a well-recognized extra-articular manifestation of RA, driven by chronic inflammation. Other options misrepresent RA’s serology (Option 1), joint involvement (Option 2), and physical signs (Option 4).
