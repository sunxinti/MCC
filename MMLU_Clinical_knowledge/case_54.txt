**1. Question Analysis**

- **Topic:** The question pertains to the appropriate ratio of chest compressions to ventilations during Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).
- **Objective:** Determine the correct ratio of compressions to breaths that should be delivered during CPR based on clinical guidelines.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**

- **CPR Guidelines:** The American Heart Association (AHA) provides standardized guidelines for performing CPR to maximize patient survival rates.
- **Compression-to-Ventilation Ratio:** For adult CPR, the recommended ratio is 30 chest compressions followed by 2 ventilations (30:2).
- **Rationale:** This ratio ensures adequate circulation through chest compressions while providing necessary oxygenation through ventilations.
- **Updates:** Recent guidelines emphasize the importance of high-quality chest compressions with minimal interruptions, especially in settings where rescuers are trained.

**3. Analysis of Options**

1. **Option 1: 2:25**
   - **Evaluation:** This ratio suggests 2 compressions to 25 ventilations, which is inverted and improperly emphasizes ventilations over compressions.
   - **Conclusion:** **Incorrect.** Does not align with established CPR guidelines.

2. **Option 2: 15:02**
   - **Evaluation:** Suggests 15 compressions to 2 ventilations, which does not provide sufficient compressions relative to breaths.
   - **Conclusion:** **Incorrect.** Deviates from the recommended compression-heavy approach.

3. **Option 3: 1:05**
   - **Evaluation:** Implies 1 compression to 5 ventilations, which severely undervalues the importance of chest compressions.
   - **Conclusion:** **Incorrect.** Not consistent with current CPR practices.

4. **Option 4: 30:02:00**
   - **Evaluation:** Represents a ratio of 30 compressions to 2 ventilations, aligning with established CPR guidelines.
   - **Conclusion:** **Correct.** Reflects the recommended compression-to-ventilation ratio for effective CPR.

**4. Final Selection**

**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks about the correct compression-to-ventilation ratio during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). This is a fundamental aspect of CPR guidelines, critical for effective circulation and oxygenation during cardiac arrest.  

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **CPR Guidelines**: The ratio varies slightly depending on the scenario (e.g., adult vs. pediatric, single vs. two-rescuer).  
- **Adult CPR**: The standard compression-to-ventilation ratio for adult basic life support (BLS) is **30:2**, emphasizing continuous chest compressions to maintain blood flow.  
- **Historical Context**: Older guidelines recommended 15:2, but updated guidelines (AHA 2020) prioritize minimizing interruptions in compressions, hence the shift to 30:2.  
- **Exceptions**:  
  - **Pediatric CPR**: May use 15:2 in two-rescuer scenarios.  
  - **Infants**: May use 15:2 or 30:2 depending on rescuer number.  
  - **Special situations** (e.g., drowning): May use continuous compressions without ventilations in some protocols.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (2:25)**: Incorrect. This ratio is nonsensical in CPR guidelines. It would imply 2 breaths for 25 compressions, which is neither standard nor physiologically justified.  
- **Option 2 (15:2)**: Incorrect. While historically used in adult CPR, this ratio was replaced by 30:2 in updated guidelines to reduce interruptions. It is still used in pediatric two-rescuer scenarios but not as the standard for adults.  
- **Option 3 (1:05)**: Incorrect. This ratio is invalid and likely a distractor. It would mean 1 breath every 5 compressions, which is too infrequent for effective ventilation.  
- **Option 4 (30:02:00)**: Correct. This aligns with current AHA guidelines for adult CPR, emphasizing 30 compressions followed by 2 ventilations to balance circulation and oxygenation.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks for the correct ratio of chest compressions to ventilations during CPR, based on current clinical guidelines.  

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- Current American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines emphasize high-quality chest compressions with minimal interruptions.  
- For adults receiving CPR by trained rescuers, the recommended ratio is **30 compressions to 2 ventilations** (30:2), regardless of single or two-rescuer scenarios.  
- Pediatric CPR may use different ratios (e.g., 15:2 for children in two-rescuer settings), but the question does not specify pediatric care.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (2:25):** Incorrect. This ratio reverses compressions and ventilations, prioritizing breaths over compressions, which contradicts the focus on maintaining perfusion.  
- **Option 2 (15:02):** Incorrect. While 15:2 is used in pediatric two-rescuer CPR, it is not the standard for adult CPR.  
- **Option 3 (1:05):** Incorrect. Excessively low compressions and high ventilations would compromise blood flow and oxygenation.  
- **Option 4 (30:02:00):** Correct. Despite the unusual formatting ("30:02:00"), this aligns with the 30:2 ratio for adult CPR. The extra ":00" is likely a typographical error.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  
The correct ratio for adult CPR is 30 compressions to 2 ventilations, as per current AHA guidelines. Option 4 reflects this standard, even with the formatting irregularity.
