**1. Question Analysis**
- The question assesses the ability to identify the appropriate stage of phlebitis based on clinical symptoms and determine the corresponding management strategy. Specifically, it presents symptoms at an IV site and requires classification using the phlebitis scale to decide the next steps in patient care.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**
- **Phlebitis Scale:** Understanding the grading system for phlebitis is crucial. Commonly, phlebitis is graded from 0 to 3 or 4, based on symptoms such as pain, erythema (redness), swelling, and the presence of a palpable venous cord.
  - **Stage 0:** No signs of phlebitis.
  - **Stage 1:** Mild symptoms like slight redness and minor pain without a palpable cord.
  - **Stage 2:** More pronounced symptoms including pain, erythema, and swelling without a palpable cord.
  - **Stage 3:** Severe symptoms with pain, redness, swelling, and a palpable venous cord.
- **Management Strategies:** Depending on the stage, actions range from observation to relocating the IV site and initiating treatment for inflammation or infection.

**3. Analysis of Options**
- **Option 1: Stage 1 - observe cannula.**
  - *Analysis:* Stage 1 typically involves minor symptoms. However, the presence of pain, erythema, and swelling suggests a more advanced stage.
  - *Conclusion:* Incorrect.
  
- **Option 2: Stage 2 - re-site cannula.**
  - *Analysis:* Stage 2 aligns with the described symptoms of pain, erythema, and swelling without a palpable cord. The appropriate response is to remove and relocate the IV cannula to prevent further complications.
  - *Conclusion:* Correct.
  
- **Option 3: Stage 3 - re-site cannula and consider treatment.**
  - *Analysis:* Stage 3 usually involves more severe symptoms, including a palpable cord, which are not mentioned in the question.
  - *Conclusion:* Incorrect.
  
- **Option 4: Stage 0 - do nothing.**
  - *Analysis:* Stage 0 indicates no signs of phlebitis, which is inconsistent with the presented symptoms.
  - *Conclusion:* Incorrect.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks to determine the phlebitis stage based on three symptoms (pain at IV site, erythema, and swelling) and the appropriate clinical action.  
- It requires knowledge of the phlebitis grading scale (typically the INS scale) and associated management guidelines.  

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **Phlebitis Grading (INS Scale):**  
  - **Stage 0:** No symptoms.  
  - **Stage 1:** Pain at IV site or redness without visible or palpable venous inflammation.  
  - **Stage 2:** Pain, erythema, and edema (swelling) at the IV site.  
  - **Stage 3:** Stage 2 plus purulent drainage or palpable venous cord.  
  - **Stage 4:** Severe inflammation extending >1 inch along the vein, with purulent drainage.  
- **Management:**  
  - **Stage 1:** Monitor and continue cannula.  
  - **Stage 2:** Remove cannula and re-site at a new location.  
  - **Stage 3 or 4:** Remove cannula, re-site, and consider antibiotic treatment or anticoagulation.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Stage 1 - observe):** Incorrect. Stage 1 does not include swelling (edema). Pain and erythema alone would be Stage 1, but swelling elevates it to Stage 2.  
- **Option 2 (Stage 2 - re-site):** Correct. The presence of pain, erythema, and swelling matches Stage 2. The standard intervention for Stage 2 is to remove and re-site the cannula.  
- **Option 3 (Stage 3 - re-site + treatment):** Incorrect. Stage 3 requires purulent drainage or a palpable venous cord, which are not mentioned here.  
- **Option 4 (Stage 0 - do nothing):** Incorrect. The patient has clear symptoms (pain, erythema, swelling), ruling out Stage 0.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question assesses knowledge of the phlebitis grading scale and the corresponding clinical management when two of three symptoms (pain, erythema, swelling) are present at an IV site. It requires identifying the correct stage and appropriate intervention.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **Phlebitis Grading Scale** (based on the Infusion Nurses Society criteria):  
  - **Stage 0**: No symptoms.  
  - **Stage 1**: Erythema at the access site ± pain.  
  - **Stage 2**: Pain at the access site + erythema and/or edema.  
  - **Stage 3**: Pain + erythema/edema + palpable cord or streak formation.  
  - **Stage 4**: Advanced signs (e.g., purulent drainage).  
- Management hinges on the stage:  
  - **Stage 2**: Requires re-siting the cannula.  
  - **Stage 3**: Re-site and consider treatment (e.g., anti-inflammatory/antibiotics).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Stage 1 - observe)**: Incorrect. Stage 1 involves erythema alone (± pain). If two symptoms (e.g., pain + erythema) are present, this exceeds Stage 1 criteria.  
- **Option 2 (Stage 2 - re-site)**: Correct. Pain with erythema and/or edema defines Stage 2, necessitating cannula re-siting.  
- **Option 3 (Stage 3 - re-site + treatment)**: Incorrect. Stage 3 requires additional features (e.g., palpable cord), which are absent here.  
- **Option 4 (Stage 0 - do nothing)**: Incorrect. Two symptoms confirm active phlebitis, ruling out Stage 0.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  
The presence of two symptoms (e.g., pain + erythema) aligns with Stage 2 phlebitis. Re-siting the cannula is the standard intervention to prevent progression.
