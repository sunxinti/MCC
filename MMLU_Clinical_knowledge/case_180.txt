**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is inquiring about the specific physiological mechanism responsible for detecting changes in blood pressure. It focuses on identifying which receptor or center within the body is primarily responsible for sensing blood pressure variations.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **Baroreceptors** are specialized nerve endings located primarily in the carotid sinus and aortic arch. They detect changes in blood vessel stretch, which correlates with blood pressure levels.
- **Chemoreceptors** respond to changes in the chemical composition of the blood, such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and pH levels, rather than directly sensing blood pressure.
- The **vasomotor centre** in the medulla oblongata regulates blood vessel diameter and heart rate but does not directly detect blood pressure changes.
- The **cardiovascular centre** encompasses areas of the brain that regulate heart rate and blood vessel diameter but relies on input from baroreceptors to adjust blood pressure.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Baroreceptors**: Correct. They are the primary sensors for detecting changes in blood pressure through arterial wall stretch.
2. **Chemoreceptors**: Incorrect. They monitor chemical changes in the blood, not blood pressure.
3. **Vasomotor centre**: Incorrect. It responds to signals about blood pressure but does not directly detect it.
4. **Cardiovascular centre**: Incorrect. It manages the response to blood pressure changes but does not detect them directly.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which anatomical or physiological structure detects changes in blood pressure. It requires knowledge of the body's mechanisms for blood pressure regulation, specifically the sensors involved in detecting such changes.  

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **Baroreceptors**: Specialized sensory receptors (primarily in the carotid sinus and aortic arch) that detect changes in arterial blood pressure. They send signals to the central nervous system to initiate homeostatic adjustments (e.g., adjusting heart rate and vascular resistance).  
- **Chemoreceptors**: Detect changes in blood chemistry (e.g., oxygen, carbon dioxide, pH) and are located in the carotid bodies and aortic arch. They are not primarily involved in blood pressure detection.  
- **Vasomotor Center/ Cardiovascular Center**: These are regions in the medulla oblongata that **regulate** blood pressure and heart rate by integrating signals from sensors like baroreceptors. They do not directly detect blood pressure themselves.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (baroreceptors)**: Correct. Baroreceptors are the primary sensors for detecting blood pressure changes. Their activation triggers reflexes to maintain blood pressure homeostasis.  
- **Option 2 (chemoreceptors)**: Incorrect. Chemoreceptors detect chemical changes (e.g., low oxygen, high CO₂), not blood pressure.  
- **Option 3 (vasomotor centre)**: Incorrect. The vasomotor center is part of the cardiovascular center that **responds** to baroreceptor signals by adjusting vascular tone and heart rate. It does not detect blood pressure.  
- **Option 4 (cardiovascular centre)**: Incorrect. While the cardiovascular center integrates inputs (including baroreceptor signals) to regulate blood pressure, it is a regulatory center, not a detector. Detection is performed by peripheral receptors like baroreceptors.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks which structure is responsible for detecting changes in blood pressure.  
- Focuses on understanding the physiological mechanisms that monitor blood pressure variations.  

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **Baroreceptors**: Specialized stretch receptors located in the carotid sinus and aortic arch. They detect arterial wall distension caused by changes in blood pressure and relay signals to the brainstem to regulate cardiac output and vascular resistance.  
- **Chemoreceptors**: Primarily detect changes in blood oxygen, carbon dioxide, and pH (e.g., in carotid and aortic bodies). They are not directly involved in blood pressure sensing.  
- **Vasomotor Centre**: A region in the medulla oblongata that modulates vascular tone (via sympathetic output) but does not directly detect pressure changes.  
- **Cardiovascular Centre**: A collective term for medullary regions (including the vasomotor centre) that coordinate heart rate, contractility, and vascular tone in response to input from receptors (e.g., baroreceptors).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Baroreceptors)**: Correct. Baroreceptors are specialized to sense blood pressure changes via mechanical stretch of arterial walls.  
- **Option 2 (Chemoreceptors)**: Incorrect. These detect chemical changes in blood composition, not pressure.  
- **Option 3 (Vasomotor Centre)**: Incorrect. It regulates vascular resistance but does not detect pressure changes directly.  
- **Option 4 (Cardiovascular Centre)**: Incorrect. While it integrates and responds to blood pressure signals, it is not the primary detector.  

**4. Final Selection**  
- **Baroreceptors (Option 1)** are the only structures directly responsible for detecting blood pressure changes. Other options represent processing centers or unrelated sensors.  

**My final selection is: Option 1**
