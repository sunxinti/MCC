**1. Question Analysis**

The question focuses on identifying the true statement regarding Addison's Disease. It requires understanding the pathophysiology, clinical features, and complications associated with Addison's Disease, a condition characterized by adrenal insufficiency.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**

- **Addison's Disease Overview:** Addison's Disease, or primary adrenal insufficiency, is caused by the destruction or dysfunction of the adrenal cortex, leading to deficiencies in cortisol and often aldosterone.
  
- **Hormonal Deficiencies:**
  - **Cortisol Deficiency:** Leads to symptoms like fatigue, muscle weakness, weight loss, and hypotension.
  - **Aldosterone Deficiency:** Results in electrolyte imbalances, such as hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, contributing to low blood pressure.
  
- **Skin Pigmentation:** Increased production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) due to cortisol deficiency stimulates melanocytes, causing hyperpigmentation, especially in areas exposed to friction and in mucous membranes.

- **Prolactin Levels:** Addison's Disease does not typically involve prolactin deficiency; prolactin is primarily regulated by the pituitary gland and is more associated with disorders like prolactinomas.

- **Hypertension and Diabetes:** Addison's Disease is generally associated with hypotension rather than hypertension. Diabetes is not a direct complication of Addison's Disease, though endocrine disorders can coexist.

**3. Analysis of Options**

1. **It is due to a deficiency of prolactin hormone**
   - **Incorrect.** Addison's Disease is primarily due to deficiencies in cortisol and aldosterone, not prolactin.

2. **Leads to generalized pigmentation**
   - **Correct.** Increased ACTH levels stimulate melanocytes, causing hyperpigmentation of the skin and mucous membranes, a hallmark of Addison's Disease.

3. **It is a recognized cause of hypertension**
   - **Incorrect.** Addison's Disease typically causes hypotension due to aldosterone deficiency, not hypertension.

4. **Diabetes is a complication**
   - **Incorrect.** Diabetes mellitus is not a recognized complication of Addison's Disease.

**4. Final Selection**

**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which statement about Addison's Disease is true. Addison's Disease is a form of adrenal insufficiency characterized by inadequate production of adrenal cortex hormones (e.g., cortisol and aldosterone). The options test knowledge of its etiology, clinical features, and complications.  

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **Addison's Disease Basics**: It is caused by adrenal cortex dysfunction, leading to deficiencies in cortisol and aldosterone.  
- **Hyperpigmentation**: Excess adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the pituitary (due to feedback from low cortisol) stimulates melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) receptors, causing hyperpigmentation.  
- **Hypotension**: Aldosterone deficiency impairs sodium retention and blood pressure maintenance, leading to hypotension, not hypertension.  
- **Hypoglycemia**: Cortisol deficiency impairs gluconeogenesis, causing hypoglycemia, not diabetes mellitus.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Deficiency of prolactin**: Incorrect. Prolactin is a pituitary hormone unrelated to adrenal insufficiency. Addison’s involves cortisol and aldosterone deficiency, not prolactin.  
2. **Generalized pigmentation**: Correct. ACTH overproduction in Addison’s causes melanin deposition, leading to hyperpigmentation of skin and mucous membranes.  
3. **Cause of hypertension**: Incorrect. Aldosterone deficiency leads to hyponatremia and hypotension, not hypertension. Hypertension would suggest excess aldosterone (e.g., Conn’s syndrome).  
4. **Diabetes complication**: Incorrect. Cortisol deficiency may cause hypoglycemia, not diabetes mellitus. Diabetes insipidus (a different condition) is unrelated.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  

**Explanation**: Addison’s Disease is classically associated with hyperpigmentation due to elevated ACTH levels, which cross-react with melanocyte-stimulating hormone receptors. The other options are incorrect because:  
- Prolactin deficiency is unrelated to adrenal insufficiency.  
- Hypertension is not caused by aldosterone deficiency.  
- Diabetes mellitus is not a complication of cortisol deficiency.

选择: 选项 2 (Leads to generalized pigmentation)

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks to identify the correct statement about Addison's Disease (primary adrenal insufficiency) from four options, focusing on its etiology, clinical manifestations, and complications.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- Addison's Disease is caused by adrenal gland dysfunction, leading to deficiencies in cortisol and aldosterone.  
- Elevated ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) due to low cortisol stimulates melanocytes, causing hyperpigmentation.  
- Aldosterone deficiency results in sodium loss, potassium retention, and hypovolemia, typically causing hypotension, not hypertension.  
- Hypoglycemia (not diabetes) may occur due to cortisol deficiency, which impairs gluconeogenesis.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Incorrect. Prolactin deficiency is unrelated to Addison's. The disease involves cortisol and aldosterone deficiencies.  
- **Option 2**: Correct. Generalized pigmentation (e.g., skin, mucous membranes) is a hallmark due to elevated ACTH and melanocyte stimulation.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. Addison's causes hypotension, not hypertension, due to aldosterone deficiency and sodium loss.  
- **Option 4**: Incorrect. Diabetes is not a complication; hypoglycemia is more common.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  
Option 2 is accurate because hyperpigmentation is a defining clinical feature of Addison's Disease, driven by elevated ACTH levels in response to cortisol deficiency. Other options contradict the pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of the disease.
