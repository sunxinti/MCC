**1. Question Analysis**
- The question is inquiring about the "normal" range of motion specifically for knee flexion. It seeks to identify the typical degrees of bending at the knee joint that are considered standard in a healthy individual.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**
- **Anatomy of the Knee Joint:** The knee is a hinge-type synovial joint primarily allowing flexion and extension. Understanding its biomechanics is essential.
- **Range of Motion (ROM):** Normal ROM is crucial for diagnosing joint pathologies. For the knee:
  - **Extension:** Typically ranges from 0 degrees (full extension) to slight hyperextension (about 5 degrees) in some individuals.
  - **Flexion:** The standard range is generally around 135 degrees.
- **Clinical Relevance:** Assessing knee flexion is vital in evaluating conditions like arthritis, ligament injuries, or post-surgical recovery.

**3. Analysis of Options**
- **Option 1: 0-115 degrees.**
  - **Evaluation:** This range is slightly below the commonly accepted normal flexibility. It may represent a limitation in flexion, possibly due to stiffness or pathology.
  - **Conclusion:** Incorrect.
  
- **Option 2: 0-135 degrees.**
  - **Evaluation:** This aligns with established clinical standards for normal knee flexion. Many medical sources cite approximately 135 degrees as the typical maximum flexion.
  - **Conclusion:** Correct.
  
- **Option 3: 0-155 degrees.**
  - **Evaluation:** This exceeds the usual normal range. Such extensive flexion might be seen in hyperflexible individuals but is not considered standard.
  - **Conclusion:** Incorrect.
  
- **Option 4: 0-175 degrees.**
  - **Evaluation:** This represents extreme hyperflexion, which is not typical in the general population and may indicate joint laxity or other abnormalities.
  - **Conclusion:** Incorrect.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks for the normal range of flexion at the knee joint, measured in degrees.  
- It requires knowledge of joint range of motion (ROM) standards, specifically for the knee.  

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **Normal Knee Flexion**:  
  - The knee joint is a modified hinge joint, primarily allowing flexion and extension.  
  - **0 degrees** represents full extension (straight leg).  
  - **Full flexion** is the maximum angle achievable when the heel approaches the posterior thigh.  
  - The **normal flexion range** is a well-established clinical value used to assess joint health and function.  
- **Anatomical and Functional Limits**:  
  - Flexion is limited by the joint capsule, ligamentous structures (e.g., posterior cruciate ligament), and soft tissue tension.  
  - Reduced flexion may indicate pathology (e.g., arthritis, scar tissue), while excessive flexion (beyond normal limits) is rare and usually abnormal.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (0-115°):** Incorrect. This range is too limited. Healthy knees typically achieve at least 130–135° of flexion. A value of 115° would suggest significant restriction, such as from injury or arthritis.  
- **Option 2 (0-135°):** Correct. This aligns with standard clinical references, which cite 0–135° as the normal flexion range for the knee.  
- **Option 3 (0-155°):** Incorrect. Exceeds typical normal limits. While some sources may report slightly higher values (up to ~140°), 155° is uncommon and suggests hypermobility or anatomical abnormalities.  
- **Option 4 (0-175°):** Incorrect. This is physiologically implausible. The knee’s anatomical structure prevents such extreme flexion. Values over 140° are rarely seen even in hypermobile individuals.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  

**Explanation**:  
The normal flexion range of the knee joint is **0–135°**, as supported by anatomical and clinical guidelines. Option 2 is the only choice that accurately reflects this standard. Lower or higher values (Options 1, 3, and 4) either underestimate or overestimate the typical ROM, which would be clinically significant if observed in a patient.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks for the standard range of flexion (bending) at the knee joint, measured in degrees. This requires knowledge of normal anatomical joint ranges of motion (ROM) in clinical settings.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- Knee flexion involves bending the knee to bring the heel toward the buttock. Normal ROM is critical for diagnosing joint dysfunction or injury.  
- Standard goniometric measurements define flexion as the angle between the thigh (femur) and calf (tibia).  
- Anatomical limits are determined by soft tissue (muscles, ligaments) and bony structures.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (0-115°):** Too limited. Even moderate knee flexion (e.g., sitting in a chair) exceeds 115°. Incorrect.  
- **Option 2 (0-135°):** Matches standard anatomical references. Full flexion (e.g., heel near buttock) typically reaches ~135° in adults. Correct.  
- **Option 3 (0-155°):** Exceeds typical physiological limits. Only achievable in hypermobile individuals or children, not "normal" adults. Incorrect.  
- **Option 4 (0-175°):** Anatomically implausible. The knee cannot flex beyond ~150° without dislocation or pathology. Incorrect.  

**4. Final Selection**  
- **My final selection is: Option 2**  
  The normal knee flexion range is 0-135°, as validated by clinical guidelines (e.g., AAOS, goniometry standards). Higher values (155° or 175°) are outliers, while 115° underestimates functional ROM.
