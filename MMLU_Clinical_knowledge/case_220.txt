**1. Question Analysis**
- The question is asking for the definition of "passive movements" within a clinical medical context. It seeks to differentiate passive movements from other types of movements based on specific characteristics such as resistance and movement dynamics at the end of the range.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**
- **Passive Movement**: In a clinical setting, passive movement refers to the movement of a patient's limb or joint by an external force (therapist or caregiver) without any contribution from the patient's own muscles. This technique is often used in physical therapy to maintain or improve joint flexibility, range of motion, and to prevent contractures.
- **Resistance**: Active movements involve the patient's muscles working against some form of resistance, whereas passive movements do not involve the patient's active muscle engagement.
- **Stretching at End Range**: Passive movements may include gentle stretching at the end of the joint's range to enhance flexibility and reduce stiffness.
- **Stopping at End Range**: It's crucial during passive movements to stop the movement before causing pain or injury, ensuring the joint is not forced beyond its safe range.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Movement with resistance, stretching at end of range.**
   - **Incorrect**: This describes active movement where the patient’s muscles work against resistance, not passive movement.
2. **Movement without resistance, stretching at end of range.**
   - **Correct**: Passive movements are performed without resistance from the patient, and often involve gentle stretching at the end of the joint’s range to improve flexibility.
3. **Movement with resistance, stopping at end of range.**
   - **Incorrect**: Similar to option 1, this involves resistance, which is characteristic of active movements.
4. **Movement without resistance, stopping at end of range.**
   - **Partially Correct**: While passive movements do not involve resistance and may stop at the end of the range, this option lacks the emphasis on stretching, which is a key component of passive movements.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks for the definition of "passive movements," a clinical term related to musculoskeletal assessment and physical therapy. It requires distinguishing between types of movements based on patient effort, resistance, and end-range actions.  

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **Passive Movements (Passive Range of Motion, PROM):** These are movements performed by an examiner or therapist without active muscle contraction from the patient. The goal is to assess joint mobility, identify limitations, or maintain joint integrity.  
- **Resistance:** Passive movements do not involve patient resistance or applied external resistance (e.g., weights or therapist resistance).  
- **End of Range:** At the end of a joint’s available range, passive movements typically stop at the natural barrier (e.g., ligaments, tendons) without forcing further stretching unless actively stretching is part of the intervention.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1:** "Movement with resistance, stretching at end of range."  
  - Incorrect. Passive movements do not involve resistance (applied by the patient or therapist). The term "stretching" here implies force beyond the joint’s natural barrier, which is not inherent to passive movements.  

- **Option 2:** "Movement without resistance, stretching at end of range."  
  - Partially correct but misleading. While passive movements lack resistance, "stretching at end of range" is ambiguous. PROM stops at the joint’s natural end-range barrier without aggressive stretching unless explicitly part of a stretching exercise.  

- **Option 3:** "Movement with resistance, stopping at end of range."  
  - Incorrect. Resistance is incompatible with passive movements.  

- **Option 4:** "Movement without resistance, stopping at end of range."  
  - Correct. This aligns with the definition of passive movements: no patient or external resistance, and termination at the joint’s natural end of range without forced stretching.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks for the definition of "passive movements," focusing on whether resistance is applied and whether movement stops or includes stretching at the end of the range.  

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- Passive movements involve a clinician or external force moving a patient’s joint without voluntary muscle contraction from the patient.  
- Key features include **no resistance** (as the patient is relaxed) and movement within the **available anatomical range** of the joint.  
- Stretching beyond the natural range (e.g., to improve flexibility) is distinct from passive movement and may involve external force or active techniques.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1** (resistance + stretching): Incorrect. Resistance implies active patient opposition, which contradicts passive movement.  
- **Option 2** (no resistance + stretching): Incorrect. While passive movements lack resistance, stretching at the end of the range exceeds the definition of passive movement (stretching is a separate intervention).  
- **Option 3** (resistance + stopping): Incorrect. Resistance invalidates this as a passive movement.  
- **Option 4** (no resistance + stopping): Correct. Passive movements are performed without resistance and stop at the joint’s natural limit without forcing beyond it.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  
Passive movements are defined by the absence of resistance (patient relaxation) and halting at the anatomical end of the joint’s range. Stretching beyond this point is not inherent to passive movements, making Option 4 the most accurate.

**1. Position Statement**

**I agree with the shared viewpoint of Qwen and DeepSeek.**

**2. Evaluation of Other Models' Analyses**

Both Qwen and DeepSeek have selected **Option 4: "Movement without resistance, stopping at end of range."** Their analyses are consistent and align closely with established clinical definitions of passive movements. They emphasize the absence of resistance and the importance of not forcing the joint beyond its natural range, which are fundamental aspects of passive movements in clinical practice.

**3. Medical Analysis and Argumentation**

Upon re-evaluating the definitions and clinical applications of passive movements, it becomes clear that **Option 4** provides a more accurate and comprehensive description:

- **Passive Movements Defined:** Passive movements involve an external force (therapist or device) moving a patient's limb without any voluntary muscle contraction from the patient. The primary goals are to maintain or increase joint flexibility, prevent contractures, and assess joint mobility.

- **Absence of Resistance:** A fundamental characteristic of passive movements is the lack of resistance from the patient. The limb is moved smoothly and gently, ensuring that the patient remains relaxed throughout the process.

- **Stopping at End of Range:** It is crucial to halt movement at the joint's natural end range to prevent injury. Forcing a joint beyond its anatomical limits can cause tissue damage, inflammation, or exacerbate existing conditions. Therefore, passive movements are carefully controlled to stop before reaching any painful or limiting barriers.

- **Comparison with Option 2:** While **Option 2** mentions "stretching at end of range," stretching is a specific application that may be part of certain passive movement protocols but is not an inherent requirement for all passive movements. Stretching implies an active intention to increase flexibility, which may or may not be present in every passive movement session. Therefore, Option 2 is somewhat narrower in scope and might not encompass all aspects of passive movements.

**4. Self-Reflection**

Upon reviewing the detailed medical definitions and the pivotal aspects of passive movements, it is evident that emphasizing "stopping at end of range" provides a more universally applicable definition. The initial selection of **Option 2** overly focuses on the stretching component, which, while relevant, is not universally applicable to all passive movements. The arguments presented by Qwen and DeepSeek offer a broader and more accurate representation of passive movements.

**5. Final Decision**

**My final selection is: Option 4**
