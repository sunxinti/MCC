**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question seeks to identify the genetic mechanism that determines the sex of a child. It focuses on the inheritance pattern related to sex chromosomes in humans.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- Human sex determination is primarily governed by the combination of sex chromosomes inherited from the parents. Females typically have two X chromosomes (XX), while males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY).
- The mother always contributes an X chromosome to the child, while the father can contribute either an X or a Y chromosome. The presence of the Y chromosome typically determines a male phenotype, whereas the absence results in a female phenotype.
- Understanding the roles of sex chromosomes and their inheritance patterns is crucial in clinical genetics for diagnosing and explaining sex-linked conditions.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **The number of X chromosomes from the mother.**  
   - Incorrect. While the mother provides an X chromosome, the number of X chromosomes from the mother alone does not dictate the child's sex. The father's contribution is equally important.
   
2. **A recessive allele on the X chromosome.**  
   - Incorrect. This pertains to the inheritance of specific traits or disorders, not the determination of sex itself.
   
3. **A single Y chromosome from the mother.**  
   - Incorrect. Typically, mothers do not have a Y chromosome; they have two X chromosomes. A Y chromosome comes from the father.
   
4. **A single Y chromosome from the father.**  
   - Correct. The presence of a Y chromosome from the father determines a male child, while the absence (resulting in two X chromosomes) determines a female child.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks about the genetic mechanism determining the sex of a child, focusing on the role of chromosomes inherited from parents. It requires understanding sex determination in humans, specifically the contribution of X and Y chromosomes from each parent.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **Sex Chromosome Inheritance**: Humans have two sex chromosomes: females (XX) and males (XY).  
- **Parental Contribution**:  
  - The mother contributes one X chromosome (since she is XX).  
  - The father contributes either an X or Y chromosome (since he is XY).  
  - A child is female (XX) if the father contributes an X chromosome. A child is male (XY) if the father contributes a Y chromosome.  
- **Recessive Alleles**: While X-linked recessive traits are inherited via the X chromosome, they do not determine sex itself.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: "the number of X chromosomes from the mother."  
  - Incorrect. The mother can only contribute one X chromosome (since she has two X chromosomes). The sex is determined by the father’s contribution of X or Y, not the mother’s X count.  
- **Option 2**: "a recessive allele on the X chromosome."  
  - Incorrect. Recessive alleles on the X chromosome influence genetic traits but do not determine the child’s sex.  
- **Option 3**: "a single Y chromosome from the mother."  
  - Incorrect. Mothers cannot contribute a Y chromosome, as they have two X chromosomes (XX).  
- **Option 4**: "a single Y chromosome from the father."  
  - Correct. The father’s sperm determines the child’s sex. If the sperm contributes a Y chromosome, the child is male (XY). If it contributes an X, the child is female (XX).  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  
The sex of a child is determined by the Y chromosome contributed by the father. Since the mother can only provide an X chromosome, the father’s sperm determines whether the child inherits an X (female) or Y (male). Options 1, 2, and 3 are incorrect due to inaccuracies about parental contributions and misrepresentation of genetic principles.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks which factor dictates the sex of a child based on genetic inheritance. This requires understanding how sex chromosomes (X and Y) are inherited from parents.  

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- Human sex determination is governed by the presence or absence of a Y chromosome. Females inherit an X chromosome from both parents (XX), while males inherit an X from the mother and a Y from the father (XY).  
- The mother’s gamete (ovum) always contributes an X chromosome. The father’s gamete (sperm) determines the child’s sex by contributing either an X (resulting in female) or a Y (resulting in male).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1:** Incorrect. The mother always contributes one X chromosome; the number (one) does not vary and cannot dictate sex.  
- **Option 2:** Incorrect. Sex determination is not based on recessive alleles but on the presence of a Y chromosome. X-linked recessive alleles relate to genetic disorders, not sex determination.  
- **Option 3:** Incorrect. Mothers do not contribute Y chromosomes, as they lack Y chromosomes (they are XX).  
- **Option 4:** Correct. The father’s sperm determines the child’s sex by contributing either an X or Y chromosome. A Y chromosome from the father results in a male (XY).  

**4. Final Selection**  
- The sex of a child is determined by the inheritance of a Y chromosome from the father. This is a fundamental principle of human genetics.  
**My final selection is: Option 4**
