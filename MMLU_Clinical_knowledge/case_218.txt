**1. Question Analysis**
- The question examines the process that occurs at the neuromuscular junction when an action potential reaches the motor endplate. It specifically asks which substance is released into the synaptic cleft to facilitate muscle contraction.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**
- **Neuromuscular Transmission**: This is the process by which a motor neuron communicates with a muscle fiber to initiate contraction. When an action potential arrives at the motor endplate (the specialized region of the muscle fiber membrane), it triggers the release of a neurotransmitter.
- **Neurotransmitter Involved**: Acetylcholine (ACh) is the primary neurotransmitter responsible for transmitting the signal across the neuromuscular junction. ACh binds to receptors on the muscle membrane, leading to depolarization and subsequent muscle contraction.
- **Other Ions and Neurotransmitters**:
  - **Sodium Ions (Na⁺)**: While Na⁺ plays a crucial role in generating action potentials within muscle fibers by entering through ion channels, it is not the substance released by the motor neuron.
  - **Calcium Ions (Ca²⁺)**: Ca²⁺ is essential for the contraction mechanism within muscle fibers but is not the neurotransmitter released at the neuromuscular junction.
  - **Noradrenaline (Norepinephrine)**: This neurotransmitter is primarily involved in the sympathetic nervous system and is not the main neurotransmitter at the neuromuscular junction.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Acetylcholine which traverses the neuromuscular junction.**
   - *Correct:* Acetylcholine is the primary neurotransmitter released by motor neurons at the neuromuscular junction to initiate muscle contraction.
2. **Sodium ions which binds to sodium receptors on the muscle membrane.**
   - *Incorrect:* Sodium ions contribute to the generation of the action potential in the muscle fiber but are not the released substance. Acetylcholine, not sodium ions, binds to receptors to trigger Na⁺ influx.
3. **Calcium ions which initiate an action potential along the muscle fibre.**
   - *Incorrect:* Calcium ions are involved in the contraction process within the muscle fiber but are not released by the motor neuron at the neuromuscular junction.
4. **Noradrenaline which increases muscle metabolic activity.**
   - *Incorrect:* Noradrenaline is not the primary neurotransmitter at the neuromuscular junction; acetylcholine fulfills this role.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks about the mechanism by which an action potential at the motor endplate leads to muscle activation. It focuses on the release of a substance or ion and its role in neuromuscular transmission.  

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- The motor endplate is the neuromuscular junction where motor neurons communicate with skeletal muscle fibers.  
- Action potentials in motor neurons trigger neurotransmitter release. The primary neurotransmitter at the neuromuscular junction is **acetylcholine (ACh)**.  
- When an action potential arrives at the presynaptic terminal, voltage-gated calcium channels open, causing calcium influx. This calcium influx triggers vesicles containing ACh to fuse with the presynaptic membrane, releasing ACh into the synaptic cleft.  
- ACh then binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the muscle membrane, initiating depolarization and an action potential in the muscle fiber.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Correct. Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter released from motor neuron terminals at the neuromuscular junction. It traverses the synaptic cleft and binds to muscle receptors, initiating muscle depolarization.  
- **Option 2**: Incorrect. Sodium ions do not bind to receptors in this context. While sodium influx occurs during the muscle action potential (after ACh binding), sodium is not the released substance from the motor endplate.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. Calcium ions enter the presynaptic terminal to trigger ACh release but are not themselves released into the neuromuscular junction. The muscle action potential is initiated by ACh, not calcium.  
- **Option 4**: Incorrect. Noradrenaline is a neurotransmitter in the sympathetic nervous system, not the somatic nervous system involved in neuromuscular junctions.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which substance is released when an action potential arrives at the motor endplate. This focuses on understanding neurotransmitter release at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), a fundamental concept in neuromuscular physiology.  

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- At the NMJ, motor neurons communicate with skeletal muscle fibers.  
- Action potentials in the motor neuron trigger voltage-gated calcium channels to open, allowing calcium influx into the presynaptic terminal.  
- Calcium influx causes synaptic vesicles containing **acetylcholine (ACh)** to fuse with the presynaptic membrane, releasing ACh into the synaptic cleft.  
- ACh binds to nicotinic receptors on the muscle membrane, initiating depolarization (endplate potential) and muscle contraction.  
- Sodium influx into the muscle occurs *after* ACh binding, not as part of the initial neurotransmitter release.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Correct. Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter released into the synaptic cleft at the NMJ. It diffuses ("traverses") the junction to bind muscle receptors.  
- **Option 2**: Incorrect. Sodium ions enter the muscle membrane *after* ACh binds to receptors, but sodium is not released by the neuron. There are no "sodium receptors"; ACh receptors mediate sodium influx.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. Calcium ions trigger ACh release in the neuron but are not themselves released into the synaptic cleft. Muscle action potentials are initiated by sodium influx, not calcium.  
- **Option 4**: Incorrect. Noradrenaline is a sympathetic neurotransmitter, not involved in NMJ signaling. Skeletal muscle uses ACh exclusively.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The correct answer is **Option 1**, as acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter released at the motor endplate to mediate neuromuscular transmission. All other options misrepresent the sequence of events or involve incorrect substances.  

**My final selection is: Option 1**
