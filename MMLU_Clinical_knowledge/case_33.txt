**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is assessing knowledge related to calcium metabolism, specifically the regulatory mechanisms and clinical manifestations associated with calcium levels in the body.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **Calcium Regulation:** Involves hormones like parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcitonin.  
- **Calcitonin:** Lowers blood calcium levels by inhibiting osteoclast activity and increasing calcium excretion by the kidneys.  
- **Primary Hyperparathyroidism:** Characterized by excessive secretion of PTH, leading to hypercalcemia. It can be symptomatic or asymptomatic, depending on its stage and severity.  
- **Vitamin D Metabolism:** Synthesized in the skin upon sunlight exposure, then hydroxylated in the liver and kidneys to become active; not secreted by the parathyroid glands.  
- **Hypercalcemia Symptoms:** Can cause nephrogenic diuresis leading to polyuria, and in severe cases, oliguria due to renal impairment.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Calcitonin causes a rise in plasma calcium**  
   - **Incorrect.** Calcitonin decreases plasma calcium levels by inhibiting bone resorption and promoting calcium excretion.

2. **Primary hyperparathyroidism is usually asymptomatic**  
   - **Partially Correct.** Historically, primary hyperparathyroidism was often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally through elevated calcium levels. However, with increased diagnostic imaging, more cases are now identified before symptoms develop. Still, many cases can remain asymptomatic, especially in early stages.

3. **Vitamin D is secreted by the parathyroid glands**  
   - **Incorrect.** Vitamin D is synthesized in the skin and metabolized in the liver and kidneys. The parathyroid glands secrete PTH, not vitamin D.

4. **Oliguria is a symptom of hypercalcaemia**  
   - **Incorrect.** Hypercalcemia typically causes polyuria due to nephrogenic diuresis. Oliguria may occur in chronic or severe cases due to renal impairment, but it is not a primary symptom.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks about calcium metabolism, focusing on identifying a true statement among four options. The key concepts involve hormones regulating calcium (calcitonin, parathyroid hormone), vitamin D sources, hyperparathyroidism presentation, and hypercalcemia symptoms.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **Calcium Regulation**: Calcitonin (from the thyroid) lowers plasma calcium, while parathyroid hormone (PTH) raises it.  
- **Primary Hyperparathyroidism**: Often caused by a parathyroid adenoma, typically presenting with mild to moderate hypercalcemia. Many cases are asymptomatic, especially when calcium levels are only slightly elevated.  
- **Vitamin D Synthesis**: Produced in the skin via sunlight, then activated in the liver and kidneys; not secreted by parathyroid glands.  
- **Hypercalcaemia Symptoms**: Common symptoms include nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (polyuria/polydipsia), constipation, bone pain, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Oliguria (reduced urine output) is less common unless severe renal dysfunction occurs.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Calcitonin causes a rise in plasma calcium**: **Incorrect**. Calcitonin decreases plasma calcium by inhibiting bone resorption and renal reabsorption of calcium.  
2. **Primary hyperparathyroidism is usually asymptomatic**: **Correct**. Many patients with primary hyperparathyroidism are asymptomatic, especially with mild hypercalcemia. Symptoms develop in advanced or severe cases.  
3. **Vitamin D is secreted by the parathyroid glands**: **Incorrect**. Vitamin D is synthesized in the skin and activated in the liver/kidneys. Parathyroid glands secrete PTH, not vitamin D.  
4. **Oliguria is a symptom of hypercalcaemia**: **Incorrect**. Hypercalcaemia typically causes polyuria due to impaired renal concentrating ability. Oliguria may occur in severe renal failure but is not a primary symptom.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question assesses knowledge of calcium metabolism, including hormone functions, vitamin D sources, and clinical manifestations of related disorders.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **Calcitonin**: Secreted by the thyroid, lowers plasma calcium by inhibiting osteoclasts and enhancing renal excretion.  
- **Primary Hyperparathyroidism**: Characterized by excessive PTH secretion, often detected incidentally via hypercalcemia. Modern cases are frequently asymptomatic.  
- **Vitamin D**: Activated via skin (UV exposure), liver, and kidneys; not secreted by parathyroid glands.  
- **Hypercalcemia Symptoms**: Includes polyuria (due to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus), not oliguria.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Incorrect. Calcitonin *reduces* plasma calcium.  
- **Option 2**: Correct. Most primary hyperparathyroidism cases are now asymptomatic due to early detection via routine labs.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. Vitamin D is not secreted by the parathyroid glands; activation requires hepatic and renal conversion.  
- **Option 4**: Incorrect. Hypercalcemia causes polyuria, not oliguria.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  
Primary hyperparathyroidism is often asymptomatic in contemporary practice, aligning with current clinical guidelines. Other options contradict established calcium metabolism principles.
