**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is assessing the understanding of blood type compatibility for transfusions, specifically for an individual with blood group B and rhesus (Rh) negative status. It requires identifying which blood types are safe and compatible for transfusion into a B Rh-negative recipient.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **ABO Blood Group System:**  
  - Individuals with blood group B have B antigens on their red blood cells and can produce anti-A antibodies.  
  - They can receive blood from donors with blood type B and O. Blood type O is considered the universal donor for ABO compatibility since it has no A or B antigens.

- **Rhesus (Rh) Factor:**  
  - Rh-negative individuals lack the Rh antigen.  
  - They can only receive Rh-negative blood to prevent the development of anti-Rh antibodies, which can lead to hemolytic reactions in future transfusions.

- **Compatibility Rules:**  
  - **For a B Rh-negative recipient:**  
    - Acceptable ABO types: B and O.  
    - Acceptable Rh types: Only Rh-negative to avoid sensitization.

**3. Analysis of Options**

1. **Blood type AB (rhesus negative), blood type B, and blood type O (rhesus negative).**  
   - **Incorrect.**  
     - While blood type B (assuming Rh-negative) and blood type O (Rh-negative) are compatible, blood type AB (even if Rh-negative) contains A antigens, which can react with the anti-A antibodies in the B recipient, making it incompatible.

2. **Blood type B (rhesus positive) and blood type O (rhesus positive).**  
   - **Incorrect.**  
     - Both blood types are Rh-positive. A Rh-negative recipient cannot receive Rh-positive blood due to the risk of developing anti-Rh antibodies.

3. **Blood type B (rhesus negative) and blood type O (rhesus negative).**  
   - **Correct.**  
     - Both blood types are compatible ABO-wise (B and O) and are Rh-negative, making them safe for a B Rh-negative recipient.

4. **Blood type B (rhesus negative) only.**  
   - **Incorrect.**  
     - While B Rh-negative is compatible, this option excludes blood type O (Rh-negative), which is also a suitable and compatible donor.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which blood types are compatible for transfusion into a person with blood group B (rhesus negative). This requires understanding ABO and Rh blood group compatibility rules.  

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **ABO Compatibility**:  
  - Individuals with blood type B have **anti-A antibodies** in their plasma. They can receive red blood cells (RBCs) only from donors with **no A antigens** (i.e., blood types B or O).  
  - Blood type AB is incompatible because it contains A antigens, which would trigger an immune reaction.  
- **Rh Compatibility**:  
  - The recipient is Rh-negative (Rh−). They can only safely receive Rh− blood (Rh− donors), as Rh+ blood would cause alloimmunization (anti-D antibody formation) unless in specific emergency scenarios not indicated here.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Includes AB (Rh−), B, and O (Rh−).  
  - **Incorrect**. AB blood contains **A antigens**, which would react with the recipient’s anti-A antibodies, causing hemolysis.  

- **Option 2**: Includes B (Rh+) and O (Rh+).  
  - **Incorrect**. The recipient is Rh−, so Rh+ blood would trigger anti-D antibody production, leading to hemolytic transfusion reactions.  

- **Option 3**: Includes B (Rh−) and O (Rh−).  
  - **Correct**. B (Rh−) is the same blood type as the recipient. O (Rh−) is compatible because it lacks both A and B antigens and is Rh−, avoiding antibody-mediated reactions.  

- **Option 4**: Only B (Rh−).  
  - **Incorrect**. While B (Rh−) is compatible, O (Rh−) is also a valid and safe option. This answer is overly restrictive.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  

**Explanation**:  
- The recipient (B−) can safely receive **B−** (same type) and **O−** (no A/B antigens and Rh−).  
- Option 3 is the only choice that strictly adheres to both ABO and Rh compatibility rules.  
- Other options either include incompatible ABO types (Option 1), incompatible Rh types (Option 2), or exclude a valid compatible type (O− in Option 4).

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which blood types are compatible for a patient with blood group B (Rh-negative). Compatibility depends on two factors: ABO blood group antigens (A, B) and Rh factor (positive/negative). The correct answer must adhere to both ABO compatibility (recipient’s antibodies not attacking donor’s antigens) and Rh compatibility (Rh-negative recipients should not receive Rh-positive blood).

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **ABO Compatibility**: Blood group B has anti-A antibodies. Compatible donors must lack A antigens (i.e., blood types B or O).  
- **Rh Compatibility**: Rh-negative recipients can only receive Rh-negative blood to avoid alloimmunization.  
- **Universal Donor**: O-negative (lacks A/B antigens and Rh antigen) is universally compatible for red blood cell transfusions.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Includes AB-negative. AB blood contains both A and B antigens, which will react with the recipient’s anti-A antibodies. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 2**: Includes Rh-positive blood. Rh-negative recipients cannot receive Rh-positive blood due to risk of anti-Rh antibody formation. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 3**: Includes B-negative (same ABO and Rh type) and O-negative (universal donor). Both meet ABO and Rh compatibility requirements. **Correct**.  
- **Option 4**: Limits to B-negative only. While safe, it excludes O-negative, which is also compatible. **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The correct answer must include all compatible types: B-negative (same type) and O-negative (universal donor). Option 3 satisfies both criteria.  

**My final selection is: Option 3**
