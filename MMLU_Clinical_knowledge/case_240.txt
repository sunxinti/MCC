**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question requires calculating the total energy expenditure in kilojoules (kJ) based on the athlete's steady-rate oxygen uptake over a specific duration of exercise.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **Oxygen Consumption and Energy Expenditure**: The relationship between oxygen uptake (VO₂) and energy expenditure is fundamental in exercise physiology. 
- **Energy Equivalent of Oxygen**: Each liter of oxygen consumed corresponds to a certain amount of energy produced, which varies depending on the substrate being metabolized (carbohydrates, fats, etc.). Typically, the energy equivalent is approximately 20 kJ per liter of oxygen consumed.
- **Calculation Formula**:  
  \[
  \text{Energy (kJ)} = \text{VO}_2 (\text{L/min}) \times \text{Duration} (\text{min}) \times \text{Energy Equivalent (kJ/L)}
  \]

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: 60 kJ**  
  Calculation: 3.0 L/min × 5 min × 20 kJ/L = 300 kJ  
  60 kJ is significantly lower than the calculated value. **Incorrect**.

- **Option 2: 150 kJ**  
  Calculation: 3.0 L/min × 5 min × 20 kJ/L = 300 kJ  
  150 kJ is half of the calculated value. **Incorrect**.

- **Option 3: 300 kJ**  
  Calculation:  
  \[
  3.0 \, \text{L/min} \times 5 \, \text{min} \times 20 \, \text{kJ/L} = 300 \, \text{kJ}
  \]  
  This matches the calculated energy expenditure. **Correct**.

- **Option 4: 500 kJ**  
  Calculation: 3.0 L/min × 5 min × 20 kJ/L = 300 kJ  
  500 kJ exceeds the calculated value. **Incorrect**.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks for the energy expenditure (in kJ) during exercise based on oxygen uptake. This involves understanding the relationship between oxygen consumption and energy production in the body, a key concept in exercise physiology and metabolism.  

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **Energy Equivalent of Oxygen**: The energy released per liter of oxygen consumed is a fixed value. The standard conversion factor is **21.1 kJ/L** of oxygen, derived from the average energy yield of substrates (carbohydrates and fats) during aerobic metabolism.  
- **Calculation Steps**:  
  1. Calculate total oxygen consumed: **oxygen uptake (L/min) × duration (min)**.  
  2. Multiply by the energy equivalent (21.1 kJ/L) to get total energy expenditure.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (60 kJ)**: Incorrect. This would require an oxygen uptake of ~2.85 L (60/21.1), far below the given 15 L total (3 L/min × 5 min).  
- **Option 2 (150 kJ)**: Incorrect. This implies an oxygen uptake of ~7.1 L (150/21.1), which is half the actual total oxygen consumed (15 L).  
- **Option 3 (300 kJ)**: Correct. Total oxygen consumed is 15 L (3 L/min × 5 min). Using 21.1 kJ/L: 15 × 21.1 ≈ 316.5 kJ, which rounds to ~300 kJ. This aligns with typical rounding conventions in clinical contexts.  
- **Option 4 (500 kJ)**: Incorrect. This would require ~23.7 L of oxygen (500/21.1), exceeding the calculated 15 L by a large margin.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  

The calculation confirms that 3 L/min × 5 min = 15 L of oxygen consumed. Multiplying by the energy equivalent (21.1 kJ/L) yields approximately 316.5 kJ, which is closest to **300 kJ**. The slight discrepancy is due to rounding the energy equivalent to a whole number (e.g., 20 or 21 kJ/L) in some educational materials, making Option 3 the most accurate choice.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question requires calculating the total energy expenditure (in kJ) during 5 minutes of exercise, given a steady oxygen uptake of 3.0 L/min. This involves converting oxygen consumption to energy using metabolic equivalents.  

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **Oxygen-Energy Relationship**: 1 liter of oxygen (O₂) consumed ≈ 5 kcal (≈21 kJ) of energy. This value assumes mixed substrate metabolism (carbohydrates/fats) and is a standard approximation.  
- **Formula**: Total energy = (O₂ uptake in L/min × time in minutes) × energy per liter of O₂.  
- **Unit Conversion**: 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ. For simplicity, some sources use 4.2 kJ/kcal or even round to 4 kJ/kcal.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (60 kJ)**: Incorrect. This would imply 60 kJ ÷ 5 min = 12 kJ/min. At 3.0 L/min, energy per liter would be 4 kJ/L (12 ÷ 3), far below the standard ≈21 kJ/L.  
- **Option 2 (150 kJ)**: Incorrect. At 150 kJ ÷ 15 L (total O₂ = 3.0 L/min × 5 min), energy per liter is 10 kJ/L, still too low.  
- **Option 3 (300 kJ)**: Correct. Total O₂ = 15 L. Using a simplified 20 kJ/L (rounded from 21 kJ/L or using 4 kJ/kcal for 5 kcal/L), 15 L × 20 kJ/L = 300 kJ. This aligns with common approximations.  
- **Option 4 (500 kJ)**: Incorrect. Requires 33.3 kJ/L (500 ÷ 15), exceeding the physiological range (~21 kJ/L).  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  
The calculation uses 15 L of oxygen (3.0 L/min × 5 min) and approximates energy at 20 kJ/L (rounded from 21 kJ/L for simplicity). This yields 300 kJ, matching the closest option. Standard rounding practices in clinical settings justify this answer.
