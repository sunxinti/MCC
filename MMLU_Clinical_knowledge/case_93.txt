**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks to identify which statement among the four provided is not true. It pertains to clinical medical concepts related to glycogen metabolism, muscle fiber types, the role of liver glycogen, and insulin's function in glucose uptake.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **Muscle Glycogen Metabolism**: Muscle glycogen is stored as glycogen in muscles and is broken down by the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase into glucose-1-phosphate during energy demand.
- **Muscle Fiber Types**: Type I fibers, or slow-twitch fibers, are more abundant in endurance athletes like elite runners due to their high resistance to fatigue and oxidative metabolism capacity.
- **Liver Glycogen**: The liver stores glycogen primarily to maintain blood glucose levels during fasting or between meals through glycogenolysis.
- **Insulin Function**: Insulin facilitates glucose uptake in insulin-sensitive tissues such as skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. However, certain tissues like the brain uptake glucose independently of insulin.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Muscle glycogen is broken down enzymatically to glucose-1-phosphate**  
   - **Correct**: Muscle glycogen is metabolized by glycogen phosphorylase to produce glucose-1-phosphate.
   
2. **Elite endurance runners have a high proportion of Type I fibres in their leg muscles**  
   - **Correct**: Endurance athletes typically possess a higher proportion of Type I (slow-twitch) fibers, which are more efficient for prolonged activities.
   
3. **Liver glycogen is important in the maintenance of the blood glucose concentration**  
   - **Correct**: Liver glycogen plays a crucial role in regulating blood glucose levels, especially during periods of fasting.
   
4. **Insulin promotes glucose uptake by all tissues in the body**  
   - **Incorrect**: While insulin promotes glucose uptake in many tissues like muscle and adipose tissue, certain tissues such as the brain uptake glucose independently of insulin.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question requires identifying the incorrect statement among four options related to glycogen metabolism, muscle fiber types, glucose regulation, and insulin function. It tests knowledge of biochemical pathways, muscle physiology, and endocrine regulation of glucose homeostasis.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **Muscle glycogen metabolism**: Muscle cells break down glycogen to glucose-1-phosphate, which is converted to glucose-6-phosphate for energy production. However, muscles cannot release glucose into the bloodstream.  
- **Muscle fiber types**: Type I (slow-twitch) fibers are abundant in endurance athletes due to their high mitochondrial density and fatigue resistance.  
- **Liver glycogen role**: The liver is the primary organ for maintaining blood glucose levels via glycogenolysis and glucose-6-phosphatase activity.  
- **Insulin action**: Insulin facilitates glucose uptake in insulin-sensitive tissues (e.g., muscle, adipose) but does not affect all tissues (e.g., brain, red blood cells).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Correct. Muscle glycogen breakdown produces glucose-1-phosphate via glycogen phosphorylase. The statement is accurate.  
- **Option 2**: Correct. Elite endurance athletes (e.g., marathon runners) have a higher proportion of Type I fibers, which are optimized for aerobic metabolism.  
- **Option 3**: Correct. The liver’s glycogen stores are critical for maintaining blood glucose, especially during fasting or prolonged exercise.  
- **Option 4**: Incorrect. Insulin promotes glucose uptake in insulin-sensitive tissues (muscle, adipose) but does not affect all tissues. For example, the brain and red blood cells rely on insulin-independent glucose uptake.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  
Insulin does not promote glucose uptake in all tissues. The brain and red blood cells do not require insulin to take up glucose, making the statement false. The other options align with established clinical principles.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which statement is **not true** regarding physiological processes related to glycogen metabolism, muscle fiber types, and insulin function. Identifying the incorrect statement requires understanding of biochemistry, exercise physiology, and endocrinology.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **Glycogenolysis in muscle vs. liver**: Muscle glycogen breakdown yields glucose-1-phosphate (not free glucose) due to lack of glucose-6-phosphatase. Liver glycogenolysis releases glucose into the bloodstream.  
- **Muscle fiber types**: Type I (slow-twitch) fibers dominate in endurance athletes due to oxidative metabolism and fatigue resistance.  
- **Insulin's role**: Insulin stimulates glucose uptake in insulin-sensitive tissues (e.g., skeletal muscle, adipose tissue) but not in insulin-independent tissues (e.g., brain, red blood cells).

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: True. Muscle glycogen is enzymatically converted to glucose-1-phosphate via glycogen phosphorylase.  
- **Option 2**: True. Elite endurance athletes exhibit a high proportion of Type I fibers for sustained aerobic performance.  
- **Option 3**: True. Liver glycogenolysis maintains blood glucose during fasting by releasing glucose into circulation.  
- **Option 4**: False. Insulin does not promote glucose uptake in all tissues (e.g., brain, RBCs, liver hepatocytes rely on diffusion or other mechanisms).

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  
Insulin facilitates glucose uptake only in insulin-dependent tissues, not universally. The incorrect use of "all tissues" makes Option 4 the false statement.
