================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question focuses on identifying the true statement regarding haematemesis, which is the vomiting of blood. It assesses the understanding of clinical features, risk factors, and associated signs that are pertinent to the evaluation and management of haematemesis.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **Haematemesis:** Indicates upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which can arise from various causes such as peptic ulcers, esophageal varices, gastritis, or Mallory-Weiss tears.
- **Vital Signs:** Hypotension (low blood pressure) and tachycardia (increased heart rate) are critical indicators of significant blood loss and hemodynamic instability, necessitating urgent medical attention.
- **Medication Effects:** Beta-blockers like Bisoprolol can reduce heart rate; thus, interpreting pulse rates in patients on such medications requires caution.
- **Associated Symptoms:** While abdominal pain can accompany haematemesis, it is not universally present and depends on the underlying etiology.
- **Patient History:** An alcohol history can be relevant, especially in cases related to variceal bleeding due to liver cirrhosis, but its absence does not rule out significant causes of haematemesis.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **A low blood pressure (<90mmHg systolic) and a tachycardia (>100/min) are worrying features**  
   - **Correct.** These signs indicate hemodynamic instability and significant blood loss, which are concerning in the context of haematemesis and require prompt medical intervention.

2. **A pulse rate of 80/min in a patient taking Bisoprolol is reassuring**  
   - **Incorrect.** Bisoprolol, a beta-blocker, lowers heart rate. A pulse of 80/min may mask underlying hypovolemia due to blood loss, making it not necessarily reassuring in the context of haematemesis.

3. **Abdominal pain is always present**  
   - **Incorrect.** Abdominal pain may or may not be present depending on the cause of haematemesis. For example, variceal bleeding may occur without significant abdominal pain.

4. **An alcohol history is not essential**  
   - **Incorrect.** While not always essential, an alcohol history is important as it can be associated with conditions like esophageal varices and liver disease, which are significant causes of haematemesis.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which statement about haematemesis (vomiting blood, typically from the upper gastrointestinal tract) is true. The options involve clinical features, medication effects, presence of pain, and history-taking relevance.  

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **Haematemesis severity**: Significant blood loss can lead to hypovolemic shock, characterized by hypotension and tachycardia.  
- **Beta-blockers (e.g., bisoprolol)**: These drugs can suppress tachycardia, masking signs of hypovolemia.  
- **Abdominal pain**: Not universally present in all causes (e.g., variceal bleeding may lack pain, while peptic ulcers may cause pain).  
- **Alcohol history**: Critical in assessing risk factors (e.g., cirrhosis, gastritis, varices).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Correct. Hypotension (<90 mmHg systolic) and tachycardia (>100/min) indicate significant blood loss and are concerning signs of hemodynamic instability.  
- **Option 2**: Incorrect. Bisoprolol, a beta-blocker, can blunt the heart rate response to hypovolemia. A normal pulse (80/min) in this context is misleading and not reassuring.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. Abdominal pain is common but not universal. For example, variceal bleeding (from portal hypertension) often lacks pain, while peptic ulcers may present with epigastric pain.  
- **Option 4**: Incorrect. Alcohol history is essential to identify risk factors (e.g., cirrhosis, gastritis) and guide management.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which statement about hematemesis (vomiting blood) is true. It tests knowledge of clinical features, risk assessment, and essential evaluations in upper gastrointestinal bleeding.  

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **Hematemesis**: Indicates upper GI bleeding (proximal to the ligament of Treitz).  
- **Risk stratification**: Hypotension (systolic BP <90 mmHg) and tachycardia (>100/min) reflect hypovolemia/shock, signaling severe blood loss.  
- **Beta-blockers (e.g., Bisoprolol)**: Mask compensatory tachycardia, making pulse rate unreliable for assessing hemorrhage severity.  
- **Abdominal pain**: Not universally present (e.g., variceal bleeding may lack pain).  
- **Alcohol history**: Critical for identifying cirrhosis, varices, or gastritis as potential causes.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Correct. Hypotension and tachycardia are established markers of hemodynamic instability, indicating significant blood loss requiring urgent intervention.  
- **Option 2**: Incorrect. Beta-blockers blunt the heart rate response to hypovolemia; a pulse of 80/min may falsely suggest stability despite ongoing bleeding.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. Abdominal pain is not "always present" (e.g., variceal bleeding often occurs without pain).  
- **Option 4**: Incorrect. Alcohol history is essential to identify alcohol-related causes (e.g., varices, gastritis).  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**  
Option 1 is accurate because hypotension and tachycardia are validated indicators of severe blood loss in hematemesis. The other options either overlook medication effects (Option 2), overgeneralize symptoms (Option 3), or neglect critical history-taking (Option 4).
