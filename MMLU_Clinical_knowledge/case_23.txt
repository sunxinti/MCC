================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question is assessing knowledge about informal carers, specifically focusing on factual statements regarding their prevalence and characteristics as of the year 2020. It requires selecting the statement that accurately reflects the situation of informal carers among individuals over 65 years of age.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
Informal carers play a crucial role in the healthcare system by providing unpaid care to family members or friends with health issues. Understanding the demographics and characteristics of informal carers is essential for healthcare planning and support services. Key considerations include the prevalence of informal carers among older adults, their involvement in healthcare processes like discharge planning, and their own health and activity levels.

**3. Analysis of Options**

- **Option 1: 50% of over 65s are providing informal care.**  
  This statement is likely **incorrect**. Prevalence rates of informal caregiving among individuals over 65 are typically lower than 50%. Studies and statistics from various countries generally report lower percentages, often around 15-20%.

- **Option 2: One in six over 65s is providing some form of informal care.**  
  This statement is **correct**. Epidemiological data around 2020 indicate that approximately one in six individuals over the age of 65 are involved in providing some form of informal care, aligning with common statistics in many developed countries.

- **Option 3: Informal carers should not be included in discharge planning.**  
  This statement is **incorrect**. Best practices in healthcare advocate for the inclusion of informal carers in discharge planning to ensure continuity of care and support for the patient after leaving the hospital.

- **Option 4: The majority of informal carers are fit and active.**  
  This statement is **incorrect**. Many informal carers themselves may experience health issues, stress, and fatigue due to the demands of caregiving. It is not accurate to generalize that the majority are fit and active.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which statement about informal carers (as of 2020) is true. Informal carers are unpaid individuals who provide support to family members or friends with health or social needs. The options address demographic prevalence, exclusion from discharge planning, and caregiver health status.  

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **Demographics of Informal Carers**: Studies estimate the proportion of older adults (over 65) acting as informal carers.  
- **Role in Discharge Planning**: Healthcare guidelines emphasize involving informal carers in discharge planning to ensure continuity of care.  
- **Health Status of Carers**: Chronic caregiving roles can lead to physical and mental health challenges for carers, undermining the notion that most are "fit and active."  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: "50% of over 65s are providing informal care."  
  - **Incorrect**: Data from sources like the National Alliance for Caregiving (2020) indicate that ~17% of adults aged 65+ are caregivers. This is closer to one in six, not 50%.  

- **Option 2**: "One in six over 65s is providing some form of informal care."  
  - **Correct**: Approximately 17% of individuals over 65 are caregivers, aligning with "one in six" (16.6%). This is supported by epidemiological studies.  

- **Option 3**: "Informal carers should not be included in discharge planning."  
  - **Incorrect**: Best practices in healthcare mandate involving informal carers in discharge planning to ensure safe transitions of care and to address their needs as caregivers.  

- **Option 4**: "The majority of informal carers are fit and active."  
  - **Incorrect**: Caregiving is often associated with physical and emotional strain. Many informal carers experience burnout, stress, or health declines, making this statement false.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  
The statement aligns with data showing that approximately one in six individuals over 65 provide informal care. The other options contradict established evidence or clinical guidelines.

DeepSeek的完整回答:
================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question assesses knowledge of demographic and healthcare management aspects of informal carers (unpaid individuals providing care, typically family/friends) as of 2020. Key focus areas include prevalence among older adults, their role in discharge planning, and their health status.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **Epidemiology**: Studies (e.g., UK Carers Trust, AARP) indicate that a significant but minority proportion of older adults act as informal carers. Exact percentages vary but are well below 50%.  
- **Discharge Planning**: Clinical guidelines (e.g., NICE) emphasize involving informal carers in discharge planning to ensure continuity of care and reduce readmission risks.  
- **Health of Carers**: Caregiving is associated with physical/mental strain; many carers report chronic health issues, contradicting the notion that most are "fit and active."  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Incorrect. 50% is an overestimation. Data suggests ~10-20% of older adults provide care, not half.  
- **Option 2**: Correct. Surveys (e.g., UK’s Age UK) report ~16% (1 in 6) of individuals aged 65+ act as informal carers, aligning with global trends.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. Excluding carers from discharge planning violates best practices, as their involvement is critical for patient safety and adherence to care plans.  
- **Option 4**: Incorrect. While some carers are healthy, studies highlight high rates of stress, fatigue, and chronic conditions among carers, particularly older ones.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  
- Option 2 aligns with validated epidemiological data on the proportion of older adults providing informal care. Other options either contradict clinical guidelines (Option 3) or misrepresent caregiver demographics and health status (Options 1, 4).
