**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question assesses knowledge about psoriatic arthropathy (psoriatic arthritis), specifically identifying true statements related to its clinical features and diagnostic criteria.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **Psoriatic Arthropathy:** A type of inflammatory arthritis associated with psoriasis, characterized by joint pain, stiffness, and swelling. It can affect any joint and may present asymmetrically.
- **Psoriasis Connection:** Typically, psoriatic arthritis occurs in individuals with a history of psoriasis, but arthritis symptoms can sometimes precede or occur without evident skin lesions.
- **Diagnostic Markers:** There are no specific blood markers that definitively confirm psoriatic arthritis. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, supported by imaging and exclusion of other conditions.
- **Clinical Features:** Nail changes, such as pitting and onycholysis, are common and can aid in diagnosis. Tophi are generally associated with gout, not psoriatic arthritis.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **The absence of plaques of psoriasis excludes the diagnosis**  
   - *Incorrect.* Psoriatic arthritis can present even in the absence of visible psoriasis plaques. Arthritis symptoms may precede skin manifestations, or skin lesions might be minimal and easily overlooked.
   
2. **The diagnosis can be confirmed by a blood marker**  
   - *Incorrect.* There are no specific blood markers for psoriatic arthritis. While certain inflammatory markers (e.g., ESR, CRP) may be elevated, they are not diagnostic. Rheumatoid factor is typically negative in psoriatic arthritis, but its absence does not confirm the diagnosis.
   
3. **Tophi can sometimes be seen over affected joints**  
   - *Incorrect.* Tophi are deposits of monosodium urate crystals and are characteristic of gout, not psoriatic arthritis.
   
4. **Nail pitting may give a clue to the diagnosis**  
   - *Correct.* Nail pitting, alongside other nail changes like onycholysis, is commonly associated with psoriatic arthritis and can be a useful clinical clue in diagnosis.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which statement about psoriatic arthropathy (psoriatic arthritis) is true. The options focus on diagnostic criteria, associated features, and clinical manifestations of the disease.  

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **Psoriatic arthritis** is a seronegative spondyloarthritis associated with psoriasis.  
- Diagnosis relies on clinical features, imaging, and exclusion of other conditions (no single confirmatory blood test).  
- Common manifestations include asymmetric arthritis, dactylitis, enthesitis, and nail changes (e.g., pitting, onycholysis).  
- Skin psoriasis may precede, follow, or occur concurrently with arthritis, and some patients may have subclinical psoriasis.  
- Tophi are pathognomonic for gout, not psoriatic arthritis.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Incorrect. Psoriatic arthritis can occur in patients without evident psoriasis plaques. Skin lesions may be subtle, occur later, or be missed. The diagnosis does not require active psoriasis at the time of evaluation.  
- **Option 2**: Incorrect. No specific blood marker confirms psoriatic arthritis. While HLA-B27 may be present in some cases, it is not diagnostic. Autoantibodies like RF or anti-CCP are typically negative.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. Tophi are urate crystal deposits seen in gout, not psoriatic arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis may cause enthesitis or "sausage digits" (dactylitis), but not tophi.  
- **Option 4**: Correct. Nail changes, such as pitting, onycholysis, or oil-drop discoloration, are highly suggestive of psoriatic arthritis and may precede joint symptoms. These are key diagnostic clues.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which statement is true regarding psoriatic arthropathy (PsA). It tests knowledge of diagnostic criteria, clinical features, and distinguishing characteristics of PsA.  

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- PsA is a seronegative spondyloarthropathy associated with psoriasis.  
- Diagnosis relies on clinical features (e.g., arthritis, dactylitis, enthesitis), imaging, and exclusion of other arthritides.  
- Up to 30% of PsA patients may lack cutaneous psoriasis at diagnosis.  
- Nail changes (e.g., pitting, onycholysis) are strongly associated with PsA and can aid diagnosis.  
- There is no definitive blood marker for PsA; it is a clinical diagnosis.  
- Tophi (urate deposits) are pathognomonic for gout, not PsA.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Incorrect. PsA can occur without active psoriasis plaques. Skin lesions may develop after arthritis or be absent (e.g., hidden plaques).  
- **Option 2**: Incorrect. No specific blood marker exists for PsA. Elevated inflammatory markers are nonspecific.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. Tophi are exclusive to gout. PsA may present with dactylitis, enthesitis, or nail changes, but not tophi.  
- **Option 4**: Correct. Nail pitting is a hallmark of psoriasis and a key diagnostic clue for PsA.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  
Nail pitting is a recognized feature of psoriasis and PsA, providing a critical diagnostic clue. Other options are inconsistent with the clinical features and diagnostic criteria of PsA.
