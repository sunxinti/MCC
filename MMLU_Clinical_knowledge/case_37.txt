**1. Question Analysis**  
The question seeks to determine which macronutrient, when completely oxidized in the body, releases the highest amount of energy per gram. This involves understanding the caloric yield of different substrates during metabolic oxidation.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **Energy Yield of Macronutrients:**  
  - **Carbohydrates (e.g., glucose):** Approximately 4 kcal/g  
  - **Proteins (e.g., leucine):** Approximately 4 kcal/g  
  - **Fats (e.g., palmitic acid):** Approximately 9 kcal/g  
  - **Alcohol:** Approximately 7 kcal/g  
- **Metabolic Oxidation:** The process by which the body breaks down nutrients to produce energy, primarily in the form of ATP. The efficiency and energy yield vary among different substrates based on their chemical structure and the metabolic pathways involved.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **One gram of glucose:**  
   - **Energy Yield:** ~4 kcal/g  
   - **Assessment:** Lower energy yield compared to fats and alcohol.

2. **One gram of palmitic acid:**  
   - **Energy Yield:** ~9 kcal/g  
   - **Assessment:** Highest energy yield among the listed options due to the high caloric content of fatty acids.

3. **One gram of leucine:**  
   - **Energy Yield:** ~4 kcal/g  
   - **Assessment:** Similar to carbohydrates, providing less energy per gram compared to fats and alcohol.

4. **One gram of alcohol:**  
   - **Energy Yield:** ~7 kcal/g  
   - **Assessment:** Higher than carbohydrates and proteins but less than fats.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which substance releases the most energy when completely oxidized in the body. It requires knowledge of the energy yields of different macronutrients (carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and alcohol) during cellular respiration. The key concept is understanding the caloric content per gram of each substance and how complete oxidation affects energy release.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- **Energy Yield per Gram**: Different macronutrients have distinct caloric values due to their chemical structures and oxidation pathways.  
  - **Carbohydrates (e.g., glucose)**: ~4 kcal/g.  
  - **Proteins (e.g., leucine)**: ~4 kcal/g.  
  - **Fats (e.g., palmitic acid)**: ~9 kcal/g.  
  - **Alcohol (ethanol)**: ~7 kcal/g.  
- **Complete Oxidation**: This implies full breakdown into carbon dioxide and water, maximizing ATP production. Fats, being highly reduced molecules with more hydrogen atoms, yield more energy per gram than carbohydrates or proteins. Alcohol’s energy yield is intermediate but less than fats.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Glucose)**: Provides ~4 kcal/g. While glucose is a primary energy source, its energy yield per gram is lower than fats. Incorrect.  
- **Option 2 (Palmitic Acid)**: A 16-carbon saturated fatty acid with ~9 kcal/g. Fats have the highest energy density due to their structure, making this the highest-yielding option. Correct.  
- **Option 3 (Leucine)**: An amino acid (~4 kcal/g). Proteins have the same caloric value as carbohydrates but require more metabolic steps for energy extraction. Incorrect.  
- **Option 4 (Alcohol)**: Provides ~7 kcal/g. Though higher than carbohydrates/proteins, its energy yield is still less than fats. Incorrect.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  

Palmitic acid releases the most energy per gram when completely oxidized due to its high fat content (9 kcal/g). Fats are more energy-dense than carbohydrates, proteins, or alcohol because of their extensive hydrogen-carbon bonds, which release more energy during oxidation.

选择: 选项 2 (One gram of palmitic acid)

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which substrate releases the most energy per gram when fully oxidized in the body. This requires understanding the energy yields (in kcal/g) of carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and alcohol during metabolism.

**2. Key Clinical Considerations**  
- Energy yield is determined by the substrate's chemical structure and efficiency of ATP production.  
- **Fats** (e.g., palmitic acid) have the highest energy density (~9 kcal/g) due to their long hydrocarbon chains and high hydrogen content.  
- **Carbohydrates** (e.g., glucose) and **proteins** (e.g., leucine) provide ~4 kcal/g. Proteins require energy for nitrogen excretion, slightly reducing net yield.  
- **Alcohol** provides ~7 kcal/g but is metabolized less efficiently than fats.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Glucose):** Provides ~4 kcal/g, the lowest among the options.  
- **Option 2 (Palmitic acid):** A 16-carbon saturated fatty acid. Fats yield ~9 kcal/g, the highest energy density.  
- **Option 3 (Leucine):** An amino acid. Proteins yield ~4 kcal/g, with additional energy loss from urea synthesis.  
- **Option 4 (Alcohol):** Provides ~7 kcal/g, intermediate between fats and carbohydrates/proteins.  

**4. Final Selection**  
Palmitic acid (Option 2) releases the most energy per gram due to its high caloric density (~9 kcal/g), surpassing alcohol, glucose, and leucine.  

**My final selection is: Option 2**
