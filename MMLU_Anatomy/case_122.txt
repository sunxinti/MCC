**1. Question Analysis**
- The question is inquiring about a specific medical condition that is treated with vitamin B-12 injections. It requires identifying which disease among the provided options necessitates vitamin B-12 supplementation as part of its management.

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**
- **Vitamin B-12 Function and Absorption**: Vitamin B-12 is essential for DNA synthesis, red blood cell formation, and neurological function. It is absorbed in the terminal ileum of the small intestine, a process that requires intrinsic factor, a protein secreted by parietal cells in the stomach.
- **Pernicious Anemia**: This is an autoimmune condition where the body produces antibodies against intrinsic factor or parietal cells, leading to impaired absorption of vitamin B-12.
- **Other Conditions**:
  - **Bell's Palsy**: A condition affecting the facial nerve, leading to facial paralysis. It is generally treated with corticosteroids and antiviral medications, not vitamin B-12.
  - **Crohn's Disease**: A type of inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract. While it may lead to malabsorption of various nutrients, including vitamin B-12, the primary treatment focuses on controlling inflammation.
  - **Graves' Disease**: An autoimmune disorder causing hyperthyroidism. Treatment involves antithyroid medications, radioactive iodine, or surgery, not vitamin B-12.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Bell's Palsy**
   - **Incorrect**: Treatment does not involve vitamin B-12 injections.
2. **Crohn's Disease**
   - **Incorrect**: While Crohn's can lead to vitamin B-12 deficiency due to malabsorption, vitamin B-12 injections are not the primary treatment but may be used as a supplementary therapy in specific cases.
3. **Pernicious Anemia**
   - **Correct**: This condition directly involves vitamin B-12 deficiency due to impaired absorption, necessitating vitamin B-12 injections as a primary treatment.
4. **Graves' Disease**
   - **Incorrect**: Vitamin B-12 injections are not a standard treatment for this thyroid disorder.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which disease is treated with vitamin B-12 injections. The focus is on understanding the pathophysiology of the listed conditions and their relationship to vitamin B-12 absorption, metabolism, or deficiency.  

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- **Vitamin B-12 Absorption**: Vitamin B-12 requires intrinsic factor (produced by gastric parietal cells) for absorption in the terminal ileum. Deficiency can lead to megaloblastic anemia and neurological dysfunction.  
- **Pernicious Anemia**: An autoimmune condition where antibodies destroy gastric parietal cells, impairing intrinsic factor production and leading to B-12 deficiency.  
- **Bell’s Palsy**: A peripheral facial nerve paralysis, often idiopathic or viral, unrelated to B-12 deficiency.  
- **Crohn’s Disease**: A chronic inflammatory bowel disease that may secondarily impair B-12 absorption if the terminal ileum is involved, but it is not directly treated with B-12.  
- **Graves’ Disease**: An autoimmune hyperthyroidism disorder, unrelated to B-12 deficiency.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Bell’s Palsy)**: Incorrect. Bell’s palsy is managed with corticosteroids or antivirals, not B-12. B-12 is not indicated unless the patient has an unrelated B-12 deficiency.  
- **Option 2 (Crohn’s Disease)**: Incorrect. While Crohn’s can cause malabsorption (including B-12 deficiency if the ileum is inflamed), B-12 supplementation is a secondary intervention for deficiency, not the primary treatment for the disease itself.  
- **Option 3 (Pernicious Anemia)**: Correct. Pernicious anemia directly results from intrinsic factor deficiency, preventing B-12 absorption. B-12 injections bypass intestinal absorption and are the definitive treatment.  
- **Option 4 (Graves’ Disease)**: Incorrect. Graves’ disease is treated with antithyroid drugs, beta-blockers, or thyroid ablation, not B-12.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question focuses on identifying a disease treated with vitamin B-12 injections, requiring knowledge of pathologies linked to B-12 deficiency and their clinical management.  

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- Vitamin B-12 absorption occurs in the ileum of the small intestine, facilitated by intrinsic factor (produced by gastric parietal cells).  
- **Pernicious anemia** is an autoimmune disorder where parietal cells are destroyed, leading to intrinsic factor deficiency and impaired B-12 absorption.  
- Other conditions (e.g., Crohn’s disease) may cause malabsorption due to ileal damage but are not primarily treated with B-12 injections.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Bell's palsy**  
  - Involves facial nerve (CN VII) dysfunction. No direct link to B-12 deficiency; treatment includes corticosteroids, not B-12. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 2: Crohn's disease**  
  - A chronic inflammatory bowel disease. While ileal involvement may impair B-12 absorption, B-12 injections are not the definitive treatment for Crohn’s itself. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 3: Pernicious anemia**  
  - Directly caused by B-12 deficiency due to autoimmune destruction of parietal cells. B-12 injections bypass the defective absorption mechanism. **Correct**.  
- **Option 4: Graves' disease**  
  - Autoimmune hyperthyroidism. Treatment focuses on thyroid regulation (antithyroid drugs, radioiodine). No role for B-12. **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
- Pernicious anemia is the only condition where B-12 injections are a primary treatment, addressing the root cause of impaired absorption.  

**My final selection is: Option 3**
