**1. Question Analysis**
- The question is inquiring about the anatomical separation of body cavities by the diaphragm. Specifically, it seeks to identify which pair of cavities are divided by this structure.

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**
- The **diaphragm** is a dome-shaped muscular partition that plays a crucial role in respiration. Anatomically, it separates the **thoracic cavity**, which houses the heart and lungs, from the **abdominal cavity**, which contains digestive organs, the spleen, and kidneys.
- Understanding the locations and contents of other cavities is essential:
  - **Abdominal and pelvic cavities** are both inferior to the diaphragm and are contiguous, not separated by it.
  - **Cranial and spinal cavities** are divisions within the central nervous system, protected by the skull and vertebral column, respectively, and are not separated by the diaphragm.
  - **Pericardial and pleural cavities** are both part of the thoracic cavity; the pericardial cavity surrounds the heart, while the pleural cavities surround the lungs. They are separated from each other by structures within the thoracic cavity, not by the diaphragm.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Abdominal and pelvic**: Incorrect. These cavities are both below the diaphragm and are not separated by it.
2. **Cranial and spinal**: Incorrect. These are parts of the central nervous system and are separated by the vertebral column, not the diaphragm.
3. **Thoracic and abdominal**: Correct. The diaphragm serves as the anatomical barrier between the thoracic cavity above and the abdominal cavity below.
4. **Pericardial and pleural**: Incorrect. Both are contained within the thoracic cavity and are separated by internal structures, not by the diaphragm.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which pair of body cavities is anatomically separated by the diaphragm. It requires knowledge of the diaphragm's location and its role in dividing major body cavities.  

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- The **diaphragm** is a dome-shaped muscle that forms the primary floor of the **thoracic cavity** and the roof of the **abdominal cavity**. It facilitates breathing by changing intrathoracic pressure.  
- Major body cavities include:  
  - **Thoracic cavity**: Contains the heart (pericardial cavity) and lungs (pleural cavities).  
  - **Abdominal cavity**: Houses organs like the stomach, liver, and intestines.  
  - **Pelvic cavity**: Located inferior to the abdominal cavity, containing organs like the bladder and reproductive structures.  
  - **Cranial cavity**: Encloses the brain.  
  - **Spinal cavity**: Encloses the spinal cord.  
- The diaphragm is the structural boundary between the **thoracic and abdominal cavities**, separating them both anatomically and functionally.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Abdominal and pelvic):** Incorrect. The abdominal and pelvic cavities are part of the **abdominopelvic cavity** and are not separated by the diaphragm. Their boundary is the pelvic inlet (a bony landmark).  
- **Option 2 (Cranial and spinal):** Incorrect. The cranial and spinal cavities are continuous along the vertebral column and separated by the foramen magnum, not the diaphragm.  
- **Option 3 (Thoracic and abdominal):** Correct. The diaphragm directly separates the thoracic cavity (above) from the abdominal cavity (below).  
- **Option 4 (Pericardial and pleural):** Incorrect. Both pericardial and pleural cavities are subdivisions of the **thoracic cavity** and are separated by the mediastinum, not the diaphragm.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks which two anatomical cavities are physically separated by the diaphragm. It requires identifying the cavities positioned immediately above and below the diaphragm.  

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- The **diaphragm** is a dome-shaped skeletal muscle that forms the floor of the thoracic cavity and the roof of the abdominal cavity.  
- **Thoracic cavity**: Located above the diaphragm, containing the lungs (pleural cavities), heart (pericardial cavity), and mediastinum.  
- **Abdominal cavity**: Located below the diaphragm, containing digestive organs (e.g., stomach, liver, intestines).  
- The pelvic cavity is a continuation of the abdominal cavity (collectively termed the abdominopelvic cavity) and is not separated by the diaphragm.  
- Pericardial and pleural cavities are subdivisions of the thoracic cavity, not separated by the diaphragm.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Abdominal and pelvic)**: Incorrect. These cavities are continuous and not separated by the diaphragm. The pelvic cavity begins at the pelvic brim.  
- **Option 2 (Cranial and spinal)**: Incorrect. These cavities are separated by the foramen magnum, not the diaphragm.  
- **Option 3 (Thoracic and abdominal)**: Correct. The diaphragm physically divides the thoracic cavity (above) from the abdominal cavity (below).  
- **Option 4 (Pericardial and pleural)**: Incorrect. Both are subdivisions of the thoracic cavity and lie entirely above the diaphragm.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The diaphragm directly separates the thoracic cavity (superior) from the abdominal cavity (inferior). No other option correctly identifies this anatomical relationship.  

**My final selection is: Option 3**
