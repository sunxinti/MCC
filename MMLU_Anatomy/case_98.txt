**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is asking about the embryological development of the facial structures, specifically identifying which fusion failure leads to macrostomia, a condition characterized by an abnormally large mouth opening.

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- **Macrostomia** is a congenital condition resulting from incomplete fusion during facial development.
- During embryogenesis, the face develops from several facial processes:
  - **Frontonasal process:** Contributes to the forehead and the bridge of the nose.
  - **Maxillary processes (left and right):** Develop into the upper cheeks and sides of the nose.
  - **Mandibular processes (left and right):** Form the lower jaw (mandible).
- Proper fusion of these processes is crucial for normal facial morphology. Failure in specific fusions can lead to conditions like cleft lip, cleft palate, or macrostomia.

**3. Analysis of Options**

1. **Maxillary and mandibular processes.**
   - **Correct.** Macrostomia typically results from the failure of fusion between the maxillary and mandibular processes on either side of the mouth, leading to an abnormally wide mouth opening.

2. **Left and right mandibular processes.**
   - **Incorrect.** Fusion between the left and right mandibular processes pertains to the formation of the lower jaw symmetry but is not directly related to the size of the mouth opening.

3. **Maxillary and frontonasal processes.**
   - **Incorrect.** Failure between these processes is more associated with other facial anomalies, such as cleft lip or anomalies involving the nose and forehead, rather than macrostomia.

4. **Mandibular and hyoid arches.**
   - **Incorrect.** These structures contribute to different aspects of facial and neck anatomy. The hyoid arch is involved in forming parts of the tongue and other neck structures, not directly influencing the mouth's size.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which embryonic structures' failure to fuse leads to macrostomia, a congenital condition characterized by an abnormally wide mouth. This requires understanding the embryological development of facial structures, particularly those forming the oral fissure and its commissures (corners).

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- **Facial Development**: The human face develops from six paired processes (frontonasal, maxillary, mandibular, and two lateral nasal processes) that arise from the first and second pharyngeal arches.  
- **Formation of the Mouth**:  
  - The **maxillary processes** (from the first pharyngeal arch) grow forward and fuse with each other and the frontonasal process to form the upper lip and upper jaw.  
  - The **mandibular processes** (also from the first arch) form the lower jaw and contribute to the lower lip.  
  - The **commissures of the mouth** (corners) are formed where the maxillary and mandibular processes of **each side** meet.  
- **Failure of Fusion**:  
  - If the **maxillary and mandibular processes on each side** fail to fuse, the corners of the mouth (commissures) are displaced laterally, resulting in macrostomia.  
  - Other fusion failures (e.g., between left/right mandibular processes) cause different defects like cleft lip or palate.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (maxillary and mandibular processes)**:  
  - Correct. The corners of the mouth are formed by the fusion of the maxillary and mandibular processes on each side. Failure here directly causes macrostomia.  
- **Option 2 (left and right mandibular processes)**:  
  - Incorrect. Failure of fusion between the left and right mandibular processes would result in a cleft in the midline of the lower lip, not macrostomia.  
- **Option 3 (maxillary and frontonasal processes)**:  
  - Incorrect. Failure here causes cleft lip or nasal abnormalities, not macrostomia.  
- **Option 4 (mandibular and hyoid arches)**:  
  - Incorrect. The hyoid arch (second pharyngeal arch) contributes to the hyoid bone and parts of the tongue. Its failure to fuse with the mandibular processes does not directly cause macrostomia.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**  

**Explanation**: Macrostomia arises from the failure of the **maxillary and mandibular processes on each side** to fuse, which normally form the corners of the mouth. This defect results in a widened oral fissure. Other options describe fusion failures that lead to distinct anomalies (e.g., midline cleft lip or nasal defects), not macrostomia.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks which embryonic processes fail to fuse, resulting in macrostomia (abnormally wide mouth). This requires understanding facial embryology and the origin of oral structures.

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- Facial development involves fusion of embryonic processes:  
  - **Maxillary processes** (from the first pharyngeal arch) form the lateral upper jaw and cheeks.  
  - **Mandibular processes** (also from the first arch) form the lower jaw.  
  - **Frontonasal processes** contribute to the forehead, nose, and central upper lip.  
- The corners of the mouth (oral commissures) form where the maxillary and mandibular processes meet. Failure of their fusion disrupts lateral mouth closure, leading to macrostomia.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (maxillary and mandibular processes):** Correct. Their fusion failure prevents proper lateral closure of the mouth, causing macrostomia.  
- **Option 2 (left and right mandibular processes):** Incorrect. These fuse at the midline to form the lower jaw; their failure causes a midline cleft, not macrostomia.  
- **Option 3 (maxillary and frontonasal processes):** Incorrect. Their fusion forms the philtrum and upper lip; failure causes cleft lip.  
- **Option 4 (mandibular and hyoid arches):** Incorrect. These arches contribute to jaw/neck structures but do not directly affect oral commissure formation.  

**4. Final Selection**  
- Macrostomia arises specifically from disrupted fusion of the maxillary and mandibular processes at the lateral oral angles. Other options describe unrelated developmental defects.  

**My final selection is: Option 1**
