**1. Question Analysis**
- The question seeks to identify which of the listed anatomical structures is derived from ectomesenchyme. Understanding the embryological origin of each structure is essential to determine the correct answer.

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**
- **Ectomesenchyme** is a specialized form of mesenchyme derived from neural crest cells, which are part of the ectoderm. It primarily contributes to the formation of structures in the craniofacial region.
- **Neural Crest Cells** give rise to a variety of cell types, including melanocytes, certain neurons, and components of the peripheral nervous system.
- Understanding the differentiation pathways of embryonic tissues is crucial. For example:
  - **Motor Neurons** originate from the neuroectoderm.
  - **Skeletal Muscles** develop from the paraxial mesoderm (somites).
  - **Melanocytes** are derived from neural crest cells (ectomesenchyme).
  - **Sweat Glands** originate from the ectoderm but are not specifically derived from ectomesenchyme.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Motor Neurons**
   - **Incorrect.** Motor neurons arise from the neuroectoderm, not ectomesenchyme.
2. **Skeletal Muscles**
   - **Incorrect.** These muscles develop from the paraxial mesoderm.
3. **Melanocytes**
   - **Correct.** Melanocytes are derived from neural crest cells, specifically ectomesenchyme.
4. **Sweat Glands**
   - **Incorrect.** While sweat glands are ectodermal derivatives, they do not arise from ectomesenchyme.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which structure originates from ectomesenchyme, a subtype of mesenchymal tissue derived from neural crest cells. Neural crest cells are multipotent and contribute to various tissues, so the answer hinges on distinguishing contributions of neural crest versus other embryonic layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm).

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- **Ectomesenchyme**: Mesenchymal cells derived from neural crest cells. They form connective tissues and certain structures in the head, teeth, adrenal medulla, and melanocytes.  
- **Motor neurons**: Arise from the neuroectoderm of the neural tube, not neural crest.  
- **Skeletal muscles**: Derived from paraxial mesoderm (somites).  
- **Melanocytes**: Formed from migratory neural crest cells that populate the skin.  
- **Sweat glands**: Their epithelial lining originates from surface ectoderm, while surrounding connective tissue may include neural crest-derived mesenchyme. However, the gland itself is primarily ectodermal in origin.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Motor neurons)**: Incorrect. Motor neurons arise from neuroectoderm of the neural tube, not neural crest cells.  
- **Option 2 (Skeletal muscles)**: Incorrect. Skeletal muscles derive from paraxial mesoderm (somites), not neural crest.  
- **Option 3 (Melanocytes)**: Correct. Melanocytes are directly formed from migratory neural crest cells, which differentiate into pigment cells in the skin.  
- **Option 4 (Sweat glands)**: Incorrect. While sweat glands receive neural crest-derived connective tissue, their epithelial cells arise from surface ectoderm. The question specifies the structure itself, not its connective tissue.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which structure originates from **ectomesenchyme**—a specific type of mesenchymal tissue derived from **neural crest cells**. Ectomesenchyme contributes to connective tissues, bones, and cartilage in the head and neck region. The task is to identify which listed option fits this origin.

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- **Ectomesenchyme** arises from neural crest cells (ectodermal origin) but adopts mesenchymal properties.  
- It forms structures like cranial bones, facial dermis, dentin of teeth, and connective tissue of glands in the head.  
- **Neural crest derivatives** include both ectomesenchyme (mesenchymal) and non-mesenchymal cells (e.g., melanocytes, sensory neurons).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Motor neurons**  
  Derived from the **neural tube** (specifically the basal plate), not neural crest. **Incorrect**.  

- **Option 2: Skeletal muscles**  
  Originate from **mesodermal somites** (myotome). No ectomesenchymal contribution. **Incorrect**.  

- **Option 3: Melanocytes**  
  Neural crest-derived but **not mesenchymal**. Melanocytes are pigment cells, not ectomesenchyme. **Incorrect**.  

- **Option 4: Sweat glands**  
  The **glandular epithelium** is surface ectoderm-derived. The surrounding connective tissue (if in the head) may involve ectomesenchyme, but the gland itself is epithelial. **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
None of the options are accurate based on strict anatomical criteria. However, the question likely intends **melanocytes** (Option 3) due to its neural crest origin, despite it not being mesenchymal. This reflects a potential oversight in the question's framing.  

**My final selection is: Option 3**
