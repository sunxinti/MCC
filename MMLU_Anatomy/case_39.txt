**1. Question Analysis**  
The question is inquiring about an organ that performs three specific functions: removal of bilirubin from the blood, manufacturing of plasma proteins, and involvement in the production of prothrombin and fibrinogen. These functions are related to the liver's role in metabolism, protein synthesis, and blood coagulation.

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- **Bilirubin Removal:** Bilirubin is a byproduct of the breakdown of hemoglobin from red blood cells. The liver processes bilirubin, making it water-soluble for excretion.
- **Plasma Protein Manufacture:** The liver synthesizes various plasma proteins, including albumin, which maintains oncotic pressure, and globulins, which are involved in immune responses.
- **Production of Prothrombin and Fibrinogen:** These are essential proteins for blood clotting. Prothrombin is a precursor to thrombin, which converts fibrinogen into fibrin to form blood clots. The liver synthesizes these coagulation factors.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Gallbladder:** Primarily stores and concentrates bile produced by the liver. It does not remove bilirubin from the blood or synthesize plasma proteins or coagulation factors.
2. **Kidney:** Filters waste products from the blood and regulates electrolyte balance. While it plays a role in producing certain hormones, it does not manage bilirubin removal or synthesize most plasma proteins and coagulation factors.
3. **Liver:** Central organ responsible for metabolizing bilirubin, synthesizing plasma proteins (including albumin and globulins), and producing essential coagulation factors like prothrombin and fibrinogen.
4. **Spleen:** Involved in the filtration of blood, recycling of red blood cells, and immune system functions. It does not directly handle bilirubin removal or synthesize plasma proteins and coagulation factors.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which organ performs three specific functions: removing bilirubin from the blood, manufacturing plasma proteins, and contributing to the production of prothrombin and fibrinogen. These functions relate to metabolic processing, protein synthesis, and coagulation pathways.  

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- **Bilirubin Removal**: Bilirubin is a waste product from red blood cell breakdown. It is processed by the liver, which conjugates it and excretes it into bile for elimination.  
- **Plasma Protein Synthesis**: The liver synthesizes most plasma proteins, including albumin (the primary plasma protein) and clotting factors.  
- **Prothrombin and Fibrinogen Production**: Both are clotting factors essential for blood coagulation. The liver produces these proteins as part of its role in the coagulation cascade.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Gallbladder)**: Stores and concentrates bile produced by the liver. While bile contains bilirubin, the gallbladder does not remove bilirubin from blood or synthesize plasma proteins or clotting factors. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 2 (Kidney)**: Filters blood to remove waste products like urea and creatinine. It produces hormones (e.g., erythropoietin) but does not synthesize plasma proteins or clotting factors. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 3 (Liver)**: Directly processes bilirubin, synthesizes plasma proteins (e.g., albumin), and produces prothrombin and fibrinogen. All three functions are core hepatic roles. **Correct**.  
- **Option 4 (Spleen)**: Filters blood, stores blood cells, and recycles old red blood cells. It does not synthesize plasma proteins or clotting factors. **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  

The liver is the only organ that performs all three functions: removing bilirubin (via conjugation and bile excretion), manufacturing plasma proteins (e.g., albumin), and producing prothrombin and fibrinogen (clotting factors). The other options lack one or more of these critical roles.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which organ performs three specific functions:  
- Removing bilirubin from the blood  
- Manufacturing plasma proteins  
- Involvement in the production of prothrombin and fibrinogen  

These functions are tied to metabolic, synthetic, and excretory roles, requiring knowledge of organ physiology.  

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- **Bilirubin metabolism**: Bilirubin is a breakdown product of heme (from red blood cells). It is conjugated in the liver and excreted into bile.  
- **Plasma protein synthesis**: The liver produces most plasma proteins (e.g., albumin, globulins) and clotting factors (e.g., prothrombin, fibrinogen).  
- **Clotting factor production**: Prothrombin and fibrinogen are vitamin K-dependent proteins synthesized by hepatocytes.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Gallbladder**  
  Incorrect. The gallbladder stores and concentrates bile (which contains bilirubin) but does not remove bilirubin from blood, synthesize plasma proteins, or produce clotting factors.  

- **Option 2: Kidney**  
  Incorrect. Kidneys filter blood, excrete waste (e.g., urea), and regulate electrolytes, but they do not metabolize bilirubin or synthesize plasma proteins/clotting factors. Bilirubin is excreted via bile, not urine (unless conjugated bilirubin is elevated in pathology).  

- **Option 3: Liver**  
  Correct. The liver:  
  1. Conjugates and excretes bilirubin into bile.  
  2. Synthesizes plasma proteins (albumin, clotting factors).  
  3. Produces prothrombin and fibrinogen (clotting factors) via hepatocytes.  

- **Option 4: Spleen**  
  Incorrect. The spleen breaks down old RBCs (releasing heme for bilirubin production) but does not metabolize bilirubin or synthesize plasma proteins/clotting factors.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The liver is the only organ fulfilling all listed functions. Its roles in detoxification (bilirubin), protein synthesis, and clotting factor production are well-established in hepatocyte physiology.  

**My final selection is: Option 3**
