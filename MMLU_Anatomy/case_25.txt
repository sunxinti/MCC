**1. Question Analysis**

The question is inquiring about the composition of exhaled air, specifically identifying which substance is present in a greater quantity when comparing inhaled and exhaled air. This involves understanding the physiological processes of respiration and the exchange of gases within the respiratory system.

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**

To answer this question, it's essential to understand the process of gas exchange in the lungs:

- **Alveoli Function**: The alveoli are tiny air sacs in the lungs where gas exchange occurs. Oxygen from inhaled air diffuses into the bloodstream, while carbon dioxide, a metabolic waste product, diffuses from the blood into the alveoli to be exhaled.
  
- **Composition of Inhaled vs. Exhaled Air**:
  - **Oxygen (O₂)**: Inhaled air contains approximately 21% oxygen. During respiration, oxygen is absorbed into the blood, reducing its concentration in exhaled air to about 16%.
  - **Carbon Dioxide (CO₂)**: Inhaled air contains about 0.04% carbon dioxide. Metabolic processes produce carbon dioxide, which increases its concentration in exhaled air to about 4%.
  - **Nitrogen (N₂)**: Nitrogen makes up about 78% of both inhaled and exhaled air, as it is largely inert and not involved in the gas exchange process.
  - **Carbon Monoxide (CO)**: Normally present in very low concentrations, carbon monoxide is not a significant component of exhaled air unless there is exposure to high levels, such as smoking or environmental pollution.

**3. Analysis of Options**

1. **Carbon dioxide**
   - **Correct**: Carbon dioxide levels are significantly higher in exhaled air compared to inhaled air due to its production in cellular metabolism and subsequent transport to the lungs for exhalation.

2. **Carbon monoxide**
   - **Incorrect**: Under normal physiological conditions, carbon monoxide is present in exhaled air only in trace amounts. Elevated levels are typically associated with environmental exposure or specific pathological conditions.

3. **Nitrogen**
   - **Incorrect**: Nitrogen concentration remains relatively constant between inhaled and exhaled air because it is not actively exchanged or utilized by the body during respiration.

4. **Oxygen**
   - **Incorrect**: Oxygen concentration decreases in exhaled air compared to inhaled air because it is consumed during cellular respiration.

**4. Final Selection**

**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which substance is present in a higher concentration in exhaled air compared to inhaled air. This relates to the gas exchange process during respiration, specifically the composition of inhaled vs. exhaled air.  

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- **Gas Exchange in Respiration**: Alveolar gas exchange involves oxygen (O₂) diffusing into the bloodstream and carbon dioxide (CO₂) diffusing from the blood into the alveoli for exhalation.  
- **Inhaled Air Composition**: Approximately 21% O₂, 0.04% CO₂, and 78% nitrogen (N₂).  
- **Exhaled Air Composition**: O₂ is reduced (~16–17%), CO₂ increases to ~4–5%, and N₂ remains nearly unchanged (~78%).  
- **Nitrogen**: Inert and does not participate in gas exchange, so its concentration remains stable.  
- **Carbon Monoxide (CO)**: Not a normal component of exhaled air under physiological conditions; it is an environmental toxin.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Carbon dioxide)**: CO₂ increases from ~0.04% in inhaled air to ~4–5% in exhaled air due to metabolic production and gas exchange. **Correct**.  
- **Option 2 (Carbon monoxide)**: Not produced in significant amounts by the body. Found only in trace amounts if inhaled from external sources (e.g., pollution). **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 3 (Nitrogen)**: Remains constant (~78%) in both inhaled and exhaled air because it does not participate in gas exchange. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 4 (Oxygen)**: Decreases from ~21% in inhaled air to ~16–17% in exhaled air due to uptake into the bloodstream. **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which substance is present in a greater quantity in exhaled air compared to inhaled air. This involves understanding gas exchange in the lungs and the composition of respiratory gases.

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- **Inhaled air composition**: ~78% nitrogen (N₂), ~21% oxygen (O₂), ~0.04% carbon dioxide (CO₂), and trace gases.  
- **Exhaled air composition**: ~74% N₂, ~16% O₂, ~4% CO₂, and other gases (e.g., water vapor).  
- During respiration, O₂ is absorbed into the bloodstream, and CO₂ (a metabolic waste product) is expelled. Nitrogen is inert and not metabolized, so its concentration remains relatively stable.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Carbon dioxide**  
  CO₂ increases significantly in exhaled air (from ~0.04% to ~4%) due to cellular respiration. This is the primary waste gas expelled during exhalation. **Correct**.  
- **Option 2: Carbon monoxide**  
  Carbon monoxide (CO) is not a normal byproduct of human metabolism. It is only present in exhaled air in cases of poisoning or environmental exposure. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 3: Nitrogen**  
  Nitrogen remains the largest component of both inhaled and exhaled air (~78% inhaled vs. ~74% exhaled). However, its absolute quantity does not increase; the slight decrease in percentage is due to dilution from added CO₂ and water vapor. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 4: Oxygen**  
  Oxygen concentration decreases in exhaled air (~21% inhaled vs. ~16% exhaled) as it is utilized for cellular respiration. **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The substance that increases in quantity in exhaled air compared to inhaled air is **carbon dioxide**, as it is actively produced and expelled during respiration.  

**My final selection is: Option 1**
