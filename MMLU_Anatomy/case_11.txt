**1. Question Analysis**
- The question examines the consequences of damage to the third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve) due to trauma to the orbit. It requires identifying the clinical signs associated with such nerve damage, specifically focusing on changes in pupil size and eye muscle alignment (strabismus).

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**
- **Oculomotor Nerve (III Cranial Nerve):**
  - **Motor Function:** Innervates most of the extraocular muscles, including the superior rectus, medial rectus, inferior rectus, and inferior oblique, which control eye movements.
  - **Parasympathetic Function:** Controls the sphincter pupillae muscle, responsible for pupil constriction.
- **Effects of Oculomotor Nerve Damage:**
  - **Pupillary Response:** Damage impairs parasympathetic fibers, leading to unopposed action of the dilator pupillae muscle, resulting in **pupillary dilatation (mydriasis)**.
  - **Muscle Control:** Loss of innervation to most extraocular muscles causes the eye to deviate laterally due to unopposed action of the lateral rectus (controlled by the abducent nerve) and superior oblique (controlled by the trochlear nerve), resulting in a **lateral strabismus**.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Pupillary constriction and a medial strabismus**
   - **Incorrect:** Damage to the oculomotor nerve causes pupillary dilation, not constriction. Additionally, the expected strabismus is lateral, not medial.
2. **Pupillary dilatation and a medial strabismus**
   - **Partially Correct:** Pupillary dilation is accurate, but the strabismus should be lateral, not medial.
3. **Pupillary constriction and a lateral strabismus**
   - **Partially Correct:** Lateral strabismus is accurate, but pupillary constriction is incorrect; it should be dilation.
4. **Pupillary dilatation and a lateral strabismus**
   - **Correct:** Both pupillary dilation and lateral strabismus align with the expected outcomes of oculomotor nerve damage.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks about the clinical signs resulting from damage to the third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve) following an orbital injury. Key signs include pupillary changes and eye movement abnormalities.  

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- The oculomotor nerve (CN III) innervates four extraocular muscles: *medial rectus* (adduction), *inferior rectus*, *superior rectus*, and *inferior oblique*. It also innervates the *levator palpebrae superioris* (elevates the eyelid) and carries *parasympathetic fibers* to the ciliary ganglion, which control pupillary constriction (miosis) and lens accommodation.  
- Damage to CN III results in:  
  - **Pupil dilation (mydriasis)** due to loss of parasympathetic input to the sphincter pupillae muscle.  
  - **Lateral strabismus/exotropia** because the *medial rectus* (adductor) is paralyzed, and the unopposed lateral rectus (innervated by CN VI) pulls the eye laterally.  
  - **Ptosis** (drooping eyelid) due to loss of levator palpebrae innervation (though not listed in the options).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Pupillary constriction and medial strabismus.  
  - *Incorrect*. Pupillary constriction implies intact parasympathetic function, which contradicts CN III damage. Medial strabismus would require intact medial rectus function, which is lost here.  

- **Option 2**: Pupillary dilatation and medial strabismus.  
  - *Incorrect*. Pupillary dilatation is correct, but medial strabismus is impossible due to paralysis of the medial rectus.  

- **Option 3**: Pupillary constriction and lateral strabismus.  
  - *Incorrect*. Pupillary constriction is incompatible with CN III damage. Lateral strabismus is correct, but the pupil sign invalidates this option.  

- **Option 4**: Pupillary dilatation and lateral strabismus.  
  - *Correct*. Both signs align with CN III damage: pupillary dilatation (loss of parasympathetics) and lateral strabismus (unopposed lateral rectus action).  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question assesses knowledge of the functional consequences of damage to the third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve) following orbital trauma. Key focus areas include understanding the nerve's roles in pupillary response and extraocular muscle control, and identifying the clinical signs of its dysfunction.

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- **Oculomotor Nerve (CN III):**  
  - Motor innervation to four extraocular muscles: medial rectus (adduction), superior rectus (elevation), inferior rectus (depression), and inferior oblique (extorsion/elevation in abduction).  
  - Parasympathetic fibers to the sphincter pupillae (pupillary constriction) via the ciliary ganglion.  
- **Consequences of CN III Damage:**  
  - Loss of medial, upward, and downward eye movement, leaving the lateral rectus (CN VI) and superior oblique (CN IV) unopposed. This results in **lateral strabismus** (eye deviated outward and slightly downward, "down and out" position).  
  - Parasympathetic denervation causes **pupillary dilatation** (mydriasis) due to unopposed sympathetic activity.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1:** Pupillary constriction (incorrect, as CN III damage causes dilatation) and medial strabismus (incorrect, as medial rectus paralysis prevents adduction). **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 2:** Pupillary dilatation (correct) but medial strabismus (incorrect, as the eye cannot adduct). **Partially incorrect**.  
- **Option 3:** Pupillary constriction (incorrect) and lateral strabismus (correct). **Partially incorrect**.  
- **Option 4:** Pupillary dilatation (correct) and lateral strabismus (correct, due to unopposed lateral rectus action). **Correct**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The third cranial nerve injury leads to pupillary dilatation (loss of parasympathetic constriction) and lateral strabismus (unopposed lateral rectus). These findings align exclusively with **Option 4**.  

**My final selection is: Option 4**
