**1. Question Analysis**
- The question is asking to identify which anatomical structure corresponds to the cluster of blood capillaries present in each nephron of the kidney. Understanding the components of the nephron and their roles in kidney function is essential to answer this correctly.

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**
- **Nephron Structure**: The nephron is the functional unit of the kidney, responsible for filtering blood and forming urine. Key components include:
  - **Afferent Arteriole**: The blood vessel that brings blood to the nephron.
  - **Glomerulus**: A network of capillaries where blood filtration begins.
  - **Loop of Henle**: A section of the nephron involved in concentrating urine.
  - **Renal Pelvis**: The funnel-like structure that collects urine from nephrons before it moves to the ureter.
- **Function of the Glomerulus**: It serves as the initial site of blood filtration, where waste products and excess substances are removed from the blood.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Afferent arteriole**
   - *Incorrect*: While the afferent arteriole supplies blood to the nephron, it is not the cluster of capillaries itself.
2. **Glomerulus**
   - *Correct*: The glomerulus is precisely the cluster of capillaries within each nephron where filtration occurs.
3. **Loop of Henle**
   - *Incorrect*: The Loop of Henle is involved in concentrating urine, not a cluster of capillaries.
4. **Renal pelvis**
   - *Incorrect*: The renal pelvis is involved in collecting urine from multiple nephrons, not a capillary cluster within a nephron.

**4. Final Selection**
- **My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks for the anatomical structure within each nephron that consists of a cluster of blood capillaries. Key terms include "cluster of blood capillaries," "nephron," and "kidney."  

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- **Nephron Structure**: A nephron contains a renal corpuscle (malpighian body) and a renal tubule. The renal corpuscle comprises the **glomerulus** (a tuft of capillaries) and Bowman’s capsule.  
- **Glomerulus**: A dense network of capillaries where filtration of blood occurs. It is fed by the afferent arteriole and drained by the efferent arteriole.  
- **Afferent Arteriole**: A muscular artery that delivers blood to the glomerulus. It is not a capillary cluster itself.  
- **Loop of Henle**: A U-shaped tubular segment of the nephron in the medulla, involved in water reabsorption. It is not a capillary cluster.  
- **Renal Pelvis**: A funnel-shaped collecting region for urine, located outside the nephron structure.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Afferent arteriole)**: Incorrect. The afferent arteriole is an arteriole (not a capillary cluster) that supplies blood to the glomerulus.  
- **Option 2 (Glomerulus)**: Correct. The glomerulus is explicitly described as a tuft or cluster of capillaries within the renal corpuscle of each nephron.  
- **Option 3 (Loop of Henle)**: Incorrect. The loop of Henle is a tubular structure, not a capillary cluster. It contains peritubular capillaries but is not itself a capillary network.  
- **Option 4 (Renal pelvis)**: Incorrect. The renal pelvis is part of the kidney’s collecting system, far removed from the nephron’s filtration structures.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks for the name of the capillary cluster within a nephron, focusing on kidney anatomy. This requires identifying the specific structure responsible for blood filtration in nephrons.

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- **Nephron Structure**: A nephron comprises a renal corpuscle (filtration site) and renal tubule (reabsorption/secretion).  
- **Renal Corpuscle**: Contains the **glomerulus** (capillary network) surrounded by Bowman's capsule.  
- **Blood Flow**: The **afferent arteriole** supplies blood to the glomerulus; the **efferent arteriole** exits it.  
- **Loop of Henle**: A tubular structure in the nephron, not a capillary network.  
- **Renal Pelvis**: A funnel-shaped cavity collecting urine, unrelated to capillary clusters.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Afferent arteriole**: Incorrect. This is the vessel delivering blood *to* the glomerulus, not the capillary cluster itself.  
2. **Glomerulus**: Correct. It is the capillary network within the renal corpuscle where filtration occurs.  
3. **Loop of Henle**: Incorrect. Part of the renal tubule, involved in concentration of urine, not a capillary structure.  
4. **Renal pelvis**: Incorrect. A large collecting region for urine, anatomically distinct from nephron capillaries.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The glomerulus (Option 2) is the definitive answer, as it directly refers to the capillary cluster within the nephron responsible for initial blood filtration.  

**My final selection is: Option 2**
