**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is inquiring about which cranial nerve is associated with the sense of smell. It requires identifying the specific cranial nerve responsible for olfactory perception among the given options.

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- **Cranial Nerves Overview:** There are twelve cranial nerves, each with distinct functions related to sensory and motor activities.
- **Sense of Smell:** The sense of smell is specifically mediated by the olfactory nerve.
- **Olfactory Nerve (Cranial Nerve I):** This nerve is solely responsible for transmitting olfactory information from the nasal cavity to the brain.
- **Other Cranial Nerves Mentioned:**
  - **Abducens (Cranial Nerve VI):** Controls the lateral rectus muscle, facilitating eye movement.
  - **Hypoglossal (Cranial Nerve XII):** Controls tongue movements.
  - **Trochlear (Cranial Nerve IV):** Controls the superior oblique muscle, aiding in eye movement.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1. Abducens:** Incorrect. The abducens nerve is involved in eye movement, not in the sense of smell.
- **Option 2. Hypoglossal:** Incorrect. The hypoglossal nerve controls tongue movements and has no role in olfaction.
- **Option 3. Olfactory:** Correct. The olfactory nerve is directly responsible for the sense of smell.
- **Option 4. Trochlear:** Incorrect. The trochlear nerve is associated with eye movement, not olfactory functions.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks which cranial nerve is associated with the sense of smell. This requires knowledge of cranial nerve functions and their specific roles in sensory or motor pathways.  

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- The **olfactory nerve (I)** is the primary cranial nerve responsible for transmitting smell sensations from olfactory receptors in the nasal mucosa to the brain.  
- Other cranial nerves have distinct functions:  
  - **Abducens (VI)**: Innervates the lateral rectus muscle for eye movement.  
  - **Hypoglossal (XII)**: Innervates tongue muscles for motor control.  
  - **Trochlear (IV)**: Innervates the superior oblique muscle for eye movement.  
- The sense of smell is a unique sensory modality, and only the olfactory nerve directly facilitates this function.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Abducens)**: Incorrect. The abducens nerve (VI) is purely motor, controlling lateral eye movement. No role in smell.  
- **Option 2 (Hypoglossal)**: Incorrect. The hypoglossal nerve (XII) is motor-only, responsible for tongue movement. No involvement in sensory functions like smell.  
- **Option 3 (Olfactory)**: Correct. The olfactory nerve (I) is the only cranial nerve directly associated with the sense of smell.  
- **Option 4 (Trochlear)**: Incorrect. The trochlear nerve (IV) is motor, controlling eye movement via the superior oblique muscle. No role in smell.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  
The olfactory nerve (I) is the only cranial nerve explicitly responsible for the sense of smell. Its anatomical pathway from the nasal epithelium to the brain’s olfactory bulb directly supports this function, while the other options are unrelated to olfaction.

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks which cranial nerve is responsible for the sense of smell. This requires identifying the nerve associated with olfaction.  

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- Cranial nerves are numbered I–XII and have specific sensory, motor, or mixed functions.  
- The **olfactory nerve (I)** is the sensory nerve responsible for transmitting smell stimuli from the nasal mucosa to the olfactory bulbs in the brain.  
- Other cranial nerves listed (Abducens, Hypoglossal, Trochlear) are primarily motor nerves unrelated to olfaction.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Abducens (VI)**  
  - Motor nerve controlling the lateral rectus muscle for eye abduction. No role in smell. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 2: Hypoglossal (XII)**  
  - Motor nerve innervating tongue muscles for speech and swallowing. No connection to olfaction. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 3: Olfactory (I)**  
  - Sensory nerve transmitting olfactory signals from nasal epithelium to the brain. Directly responsible for smell. **Correct**.  
- **Option 4: Trochlear (IV)**  
  - Motor nerve controlling the superior oblique muscle for eye movement. No sensory role in smell. **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
- The olfactory nerve (I) is the sole cranial nerve dedicated to the sense of smell. All other options are motor nerves unrelated to sensory olfaction.  

**My final selection is: Option 3**
