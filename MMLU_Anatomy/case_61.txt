**1. Question Analysis**
- The question asks about the specific sensory and motor deficits resulting from damage to the glossopharyngeal nerve in a patient. It requires identifying which functions the glossopharyngeal nerve is responsible for and determining the consequences of its impairment.

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**
- **Glossopharyngeal Nerve (Cranial Nerve IX):**
  - **Sensory Functions:**
    - Provides general somatosensory innervation (touch, pain, temperature) to the posterior one-third of the tongue.
    - Carries special sensory fibers for taste from the posterior one-third of the tongue.
  - **Motor Functions:**
    - Innervates the stylopharyngeus muscle, which is involved in swallowing.
  - **Autonomic Functions:**
    - Supplies parasympathetic fibers to the parotid gland for salivation.
- **Taste and Somatosensory Innervation of the Tongue:**
  - **Anterior Two-Thirds:**
    - Taste and general sensation are mediated by the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve (Cranial Nerve VII).
  - **Posterior One-Third:**
    - Taste and general sensation are mediated by the glossopharyngeal nerve (Cranial Nerve IX).

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Loss of taste over the anterior two-thirds of the tongue.**
   - **Incorrect.** The anterior two-thirds of the tongue receive taste sensations from the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve, not the glossopharyngeal nerve.
2. **Loss of somatosensory sensation over the anterior two-thirds of the tongue.**
   - **Incorrect.** General somatosensory innervation of the anterior two-thirds of the tongue is also provided by the facial nerve via the chorda tympani.
3. **Loss of taste and somatosensory sensation over the posterior third of the tongue.**
   - **Correct.** The glossopharyngeal nerve is responsible for both taste and general somatosensory innervation of the posterior third of the tongue.
4. **Paralysis of the muscles of the tongue.**
   - **Incorrect.** Motor innervation to the muscles of the tongue is primarily provided by the hypoglossal nerve (Cranial Nerve XII), except for the stylopharyngeus muscle, which is innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve. However, paralysis of the stylopharyngeus would affect swallowing rather than causing generalized paralysis of the tongue muscles.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks about the consequences of glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX) damage, focusing on taste and somatic sensation in the tongue and possible muscle paralysis.  
- Key concepts involve understanding the neural pathways for taste, somatic sensation, and motor function in the tongue.  

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- **Glossopharyngeal Nerve (CN IX):**  
  - **Taste:** Carries taste sensations from the **posterior third of the tongue** via its lingual branch.  
  - **Somatic Sensation:** Provides general somatic sensory innervation (touch, pain, temperature) to the **posterior third of the tongue**.  
  - **Motor Function:** Supplies parasympathetic fibers to the parotid gland and motor branches to the stylopharyngeus muscle but **does not innervate the intrinsic/extrinsic tongue muscles**.  

- **Other Relevant Nerves:**  
  - **Facial Nerve (CN VII):** Manages taste for the **anterior two-thirds of the tongue** via the chorda tympani.  
  - **Trigeminal Nerve (CN V):** Provides somatic sensation to the **anterior two-thirds of the tongue** via the lingual branch of the mandibular division (V3).  
  - **Hypoglossal Nerve (CN XII):** Innervates all **intrinsic and extrinsic tongue muscles**, controlling tongue movement.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1:** Loss of taste over the anterior two-thirds of the tongue.  
  - Incorrect. Taste in the anterior two-thirds is mediated by CN VII (chorda tympani), not CN IX. Glossopharyngeal nerve damage would not affect this region.  

- **Option 2:** Loss of somatic sensation over the anterior two-thirds of the tongue.  
  - Incorrect. Somatic sensation for the anterior two-thirds is carried by CN V (lingual nerve), not CN IX. Damage to CN IX would not impair this area.  

- **Option 3:** Loss of taste and somatic sensation over the posterior third of the tongue.  
  - Correct. Both taste and somatic sensation in the posterior third of the tongue are exclusively innervated by CN IX. Damage here would produce these deficits.  

- **Option 4:** Paralysis of the muscles of the tongue.  
  - Incorrect. Tongue muscles are innervated by the hypoglossal nerve (CN XII). Glossopharyngeal nerve damage does not affect tongue motor function.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  
- The glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) is solely responsible for taste and somatic sensation in the **posterior third of the tongue**. Damage to this nerve would therefore result in deficits in both modalities in that region. The other options incorrectly attribute anterior tongue functions (CN VII and CN V) or motor deficits (CN XII) to glossopharyngeal nerve damage.

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks which functional deficits occur due to damage to the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX), specifically focusing on taste, somaesthetic sensation, or motor function in the tongue.

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- **Glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX)** provides:  
  - *Taste sensation* from the **posterior third of the tongue**.  
  - *General sensory (somaesthetic) innervation* (e.g., pain, temperature, touch) to the **posterior third of the tongue**.  
  - Motor innervation to the stylopharyngeus muscle (swallowing) and parasympathetic fibers to the parotid gland.  
- **Anterior two-thirds of the tongue**:  
  - *Taste*: Chorda tympani (branch of facial nerve, CN VII).  
  - *General sensation*: Lingual nerve (branch of trigeminal nerve, CN V3).  
- **Tongue muscle paralysis** is controlled by the hypoglossal nerve (CN XII).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Incorrect. Loss of taste in the anterior two-thirds involves CN VII (chorda tympani), not CN IX.  
- **Option 2**: Incorrect. Somaesthetic sensation in the anterior two-thirds is mediated by CN V3 (lingual nerve), not CN IX.  
- **Option 3**: Correct. CN IX provides **both taste and general sensation to the posterior third of the tongue**. Damage would impair both modalities here.  
- **Option 4**: Incorrect. Tongue muscle paralysis results from CN XII damage, not CN IX.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) is solely responsible for taste and general sensory innervation of the posterior third of the tongue. Damage would cause deficits in both functions, as described in **Option 3**.  

**My final selection is: Option 3**
