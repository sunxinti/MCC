**1. Question Analysis**
- The question is asking which specific muscles are actively involved during the process of quiet inspiration in human anatomy.

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**
- **Diaphragm**: The primary muscle of respiration, responsible for the majority of the inhalation process by contracting and flattening to increase the thoracic cavity volume.
- **External Intercostal Muscles**: Assist in quiet inspiration by elevating the ribs, which further increases the thoracic cavity volume.
- **Internal Intercostal Muscles**: Primarily involved in forced expiration, not typically active during quiet breathing.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **External and internal intercostal muscles**
   - **Incorrect**: Internal intercostals are not usually active during quiet inspiration.
2. **External intercostal muscles and diaphragm**
   - **Correct**: Both muscles are actively involved in quiet inspiration.
3. **Internal intercostal muscles and diaphragm**
   - **Incorrect**: Internal intercostals are not active during quiet inspiration.
4. **External and internal intercostal muscles and diaphragm**
   - **Incorrect**: Includes internal intercostals, which are not active during quiet inspiration.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which muscles are active during **quiet inspiration**, a phase of normal, relaxed breathing. It requires knowledge of the primary and accessory muscles involved in this process, distinguishing between muscles active during normal versus forced respiration.

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- **Diaphragm**: The primary muscle responsible for quiet inspiration. It contracts and flattens, increasing vertical thoracic volume.  
- **External intercostal muscles**: These elevate the ribs (lifting the rib cage) during quiet inspiration, contributing to lateral and anteroposterior expansion of the thorax.  
- **Internal intercostal muscles**: These muscles act during forced expiration, pulling the ribs downward and inward. They are **not active** during quiet inspiration.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (External and internal intercostal muscles)**: Incorrect. The internal intercostals are inactive during quiet inspiration; they are primarily involved in forced expiration.  
- **Option 2 (External intercostal muscles and diaphragm)**: Correct. These are the two muscles actively contracting during quiet inspiration.  
- **Option 3 (Internal intercostal muscles and diaphragm)**: Incorrect. The internal intercostals do not contribute to quiet inspiration.  
- **Option 4 (External and internal intercostal muscles and diaphragm)**: Incorrect. The internal intercostals are not active during quiet inspiration.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which muscles are active during **quiet inspiration** (normal, resting breathing). It requires distinguishing between muscles involved in quiet vs. forced breathing and understanding their roles in the respiratory cycle.

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- **Quiet inspiration** is primarily driven by the **diaphragm** (flattens to increase thoracic volume) and **external intercostal muscles** (elevate ribs, expanding the chest laterally).  
- **Internal intercostal muscles** are generally active during **forced expiration** (depress ribs, reducing thoracic volume). However, the **parasternal portion** of the internal intercostals (near the sternum) may assist in inspiration, but this is a nuanced distinction often omitted in basic anatomical contexts.  
- During quiet breathing, expiration is **passive** (no muscle contraction required), relying on elastic recoil of the lungs and thoracic wall.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (External and internal intercostals):** Incorrect. Internal intercostals (excluding the parasternal portion) are expiratory and inactive during quiet inspiration.  
- **Option 2 (External intercostals and diaphragm):** Correct. These are the primary muscles for quiet inspiration. The diaphragm accounts for ~75% of air intake, while external intercostals assist rib elevation.  
- **Option 3 (Internal intercostals and diaphragm):** Incorrect. Internal intercostals are not active during quiet inspiration.  
- **Option 4 (All three muscles):** Incorrect. Internal intercostals (as a whole) are not involved in quiet inspiration.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  
The diaphragm and external intercostal muscles are unequivocally active during quiet inspiration. Internal intercostals (excluding the parasternal portion) are expiratory and not engaged in normal resting breathing, making Option 2 the most accurate answer.
