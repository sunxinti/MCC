**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is inquiring about the specific type of bone fracture based on its characteristics: the radius bone is bent but not displaced, and the skin remains intact. The focus is on identifying the correct nomenclature for this type of fracture.

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- **Fracture Classification:** Fractures can be classified based on various criteria, including displacement, the integrity of the skin, and the pattern of the break.
- **Closed vs. Open Fractures:** A closed fracture means the skin remains intact, whereas an open (compound) fracture involves a break in the skin.
- **Greenstick Fracture:** Typically occurs in children due to their more flexible bones, where the bone bends and cracks but does not break all the way through.
- **Comminuted Fracture:** Involves the bone being broken into multiple pieces.
- **Transverse Fracture:** The break is perpendicular to the bone's long axis.
- **Spiral Fracture:** The break spirals around the bone, often caused by a twisting force.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Closed, greenstick**  
   - **Closed:** Correct, as the skin is intact.
   - **Greenstick:** Appropriate if the bone is bent but not fully broken, typically seen in children.
   - **Conclusion:** This option accurately describes the fracture as the radius is bent without displacement and the skin remains intact.

2. **Complex, comminuted**  
   - **Complex:** Generally refers to fractures with multiple fragments or associated with soft tissue damage.
   - **Comminuted:** Indicates the bone is broken into several pieces.
   - **Conclusion:** Incorrect, as the fracture described does not involve multiple bone fragments.

3. **Compound, transverse**  
   - **Compound:** Synonymous with open fractures where the bone pierces the skin.
   - **Transverse:** Describes the orientation of the fracture line.
   - **Conclusion:** Incorrect, as the skin is intact, making the term "compound" inappropriate.

4. **Open, spiral**  
   - **Open:** Indicates that the skin is broken, which contradicts the question.
   - **Spiral:** Describes the spiral nature of the fracture line.
   - **Conclusion:** Incorrect, as the fracture is not open.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks to identify the type of fracture in the radius characterized by bending without displacement and intact skin. Key terms to analyze include **closed/open**, **displacement**, and **fracture type** (e.g., greenstick, comminuted, transverse, spiral).  

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- **Closed vs. Open (Compound):** A closed fracture involves no skin breach, while an open (compound) fracture breaks the skin, risking infection.  
- **Greenstick Fracture:** A partial fracture where the bone bends and cracks but does not fully break, common in pediatric patients with flexible bones. Displacement is minimal or absent.  
- **Displacement:** If the bone fragments are misaligned, it is displaced; if not, it is non-displaced.  
- **Fracture Patterns:**  
  - **Comminuted:** Bone breaks into three or more fragments.  
  - **Transverse:** Clean, straight fracture line.  
  - **Spiral:** Twisted, corkscrew-like fracture line, often due to rotational forces.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Closed, greenstick**  
  - **Closed:** Correct, as the skin remains intact.  
  - **Greenstick:** Correct, as the radius is bent but not fully broken or displaced.  
  - **Conclusion:** Matches the description perfectly.  

- **Option 2: Complex, comminuted**  
  - **Complex:** Typically refers to fractures involving joints (intra-articular) or severe soft-tissue injury, which is not specified here.  
  - **Comminuted:** Involves multiple bone fragments, conflicting with "bent but not displaced."  
  - **Conclusion:** Incorrect.  

- **Option 3: Compound, transverse**  
  - **Compound:** Incorrect, as the skin is intact (closed).  
  - **Transverse:** A straight fracture line, which does not describe bending.  
  - **Conclusion:** Incorrect.  

- **Option 4: Open, spiral**  
  - **Open:** Incorrect, as the skin is intact.  
  - **Spiral:** A twisting fracture pattern, not a bending injury.  
  - **Conclusion:** Incorrect.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**  
The fracture is **closed** because the skin is intact and **greenstick** because the radius is bent but not displaced. This combination aligns precisely with the clinical description provided.

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks to classify a fracture of the radius characterized by bending without displacement and intact skin.  
- Key terms: "bent but not displaced" and "skin intact," requiring differentiation between fracture types (e.g., closed vs. open, greenstick vs. comminuted).  

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- **Closed vs. Open Fractures**: Closed fractures involve no skin breach; open (compound) fractures expose bone through broken skin.  
- **Greenstick Fracture**: An incomplete fracture where the bone bends and partially breaks, common in children due to flexible bones.  
- **Displacement**: Refers to bone fragments shifting out of alignment; "not displaced" implies the bone remains in anatomical position despite bending.  
- **Other Fracture Types**:  
  - *Comminuted*: Bone shattered into multiple fragments.  
  - *Transverse*: Break perpendicular to the bone’s axis.  
  - *Spiral*: Caused by rotational force, creating a helical fracture line.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Closed, greenstick**  
   - **Closed**: Correct, as skin is intact.  
   - **Greenstick**: Matches "bent but not displaced," typical of incomplete pediatric fractures. **Correct**.  

2. **Complex, comminuted**  
   - **Complex**: Often synonymous with "compound" (open), which is incorrect here.  
   - **Comminuted**: Requires multiple fragments, inconsistent with "not displaced." **Incorrect**.  

3. **Compound, transverse**  
   - **Compound**: Incorrect, as skin is intact.  
   - **Transverse**: A complete break across the bone, not aligned with "bent." **Incorrect**.  

4. **Open, spiral**  
   - **Open**: Incorrect due to intact skin.  
   - **Spiral**: Requires twisting mechanism, not described here. **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The fracture is **closed** (skin intact) and **greenstick** (bent, non-displaced, incomplete fracture). No other option aligns with both criteria.  

**My final selection is: Option 1**
