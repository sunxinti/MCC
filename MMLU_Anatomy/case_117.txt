**1. Question Analysis**
- The question seeks to identify which anatomical structure in males is situated at the neck of the bladder and envelops the urethra.

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**
- **Bladder and Urethra Anatomy**: In males, the bladder connects to the urethra at the bladder neck. The urethra then passes through various structures before exiting the body.
- **Prostate Gland**: A walnut-sized gland located below the bladder that surrounds the prostatic part of the urethra.
- **Epididymis**: Located in the scrotum, connected to the testes; involved in sperm storage and maturation.
- **Scrotum**: The external pouch containing the testes, outside the pelvic cavity.
- **Seminal Vesicles**: Glands located behind the bladder that secrete seminal fluid, but they do not surround the urethra.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Epididymis**
   - *Incorrect*. The epididymis is part of the reproductive system located in the scrotum, not near the bladder or urethra.
2. **Prostate**
   - *Correct*. The prostate is located at the neck of the bladder and surrounds the prostatic urethra, playing a crucial role in male reproductive function.
3. **Scrotum**
   - *Incorrect*. The scrotum houses the testes and is not related to the bladder or urethra's anatomical positioning.
4. **Seminal Vesicle**
   - *Incorrect*. While seminal vesicles are near the bladder, they do not surround the urethra.

**4. Final Selection**

**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which structure in males is located at the **neck of the bladder** and **surrounds the urethra**. Key terms here are "neck of the bladder" (the inferior aspect of the urinary bladder) and "surrounds the urethra," requiring identification of a structure anatomically positioned around the urethral passage near the bladder.

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- **Bladder anatomy**: The bladder neck is the inferior portion of the bladder that transitions into the urethra.  
- **Male urethra**: The prostatic urethra segment passes through the prostate gland.  
- **Prostate gland**: A muscular, walnut-sized structure that encircles the urethra just below the bladder. It contributes to urethral sphincter function and secretes seminal fluid.  
- **Epididymis**: A coiled tube on the posterior aspect of the testis, located in the scrotum, unrelated to the bladder or urethral neck.  
- **Scrotum**: A skin-covered sac containing the testes, situated inferior to the penis, not near the bladder.  
- **Seminal vesicles**: Paired glands posterior to the bladder, near the base (not the neck), contributing to semen but not directly encircling the urethra.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Epididymis**: Incorrect. The epididymis is part of the testis and located in the scrotum, far from the bladder neck. It stores and transports sperm, not involved in urethral encirclement near the bladder.  
2. **Prostate**: Correct. The prostate is a gland that directly surrounds the prostatic urethra at the bladder neck. Its anatomical position is critical for supporting the urethra and bladder outlet.  
3. **Scrotum**: Incorrect. The scrotum is a skin structure housing the testes and is unrelated to the bladder or urethral neck.  
4. **Seminal vesicle**: Incorrect. Seminal vesicles are posterior to the bladder base and connected to the ejaculatory ducts, but they do not encircle the urethra at the bladder neck.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks which male anatomical structure is positioned at the neck of the urinary bladder and encircles the urethra. This requires understanding the spatial relationships between pelvic organs and the urethra’s anatomical course.

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- The **neck of the bladder** is the inferior portion where the bladder transitions into the urethra.  
- In males, the **prostate gland** is a walnut-sized structure situated inferior to the bladder. It directly surrounds the **prostatic urethra** (the portion of the urethra passing through the prostate).  
- The prostate’s anatomical position and function (secreting prostatic fluid) depend on its intimate relationship with the bladder neck and urethra.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Epididymis**  
  - The epididymis is a coiled tube attached to the testis, involved in sperm maturation. It is located in the scrotum, far from the bladder and urethra. **Incorrect**.  

- **Option 2: Prostate**  
  - The prostate gland is anatomically located at the bladder neck and envelops the urethra. This matches the question’s description. **Correct**.  

- **Option 3: Scrotum**  
  - The scrotum is an external sac housing the testes. It has no anatomical connection to the bladder or urethra. **Incorrect**.  

- **Option 4: Seminal Vesicle**  
  - The seminal vesicles are paired glands posterior to the bladder, contributing to seminal fluid. They do not surround the urethra. **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The prostate gland is the only structure that fulfills the criteria of being located at the bladder neck and surrounding the urethra. Its anatomical position and functional role confirm this.  

**My final selection is: Option 2**
