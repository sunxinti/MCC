**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is inquiring about the specific bones connected by the coronal suture in the human skull. It requires knowledge of cranial sutures and the bones they join.

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- The human skull consists of several cranial sutures, which are fibrous joints that connect the bones of the skull.
- The **coronal suture** is one of the major sutures located at the front of the skull.
- It extends laterally from ear to ear and connects specific bones, playing a crucial role in the structure and integrity of the cranial vault.
- Understanding the locations and connections of cranial sutures is essential for accurately identifying which bones they join.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: frontal and parietal bones.**  
  - **Correct.** The coronal suture specifically joins the frontal bone to the parietal bones on each side of the skull.
  
- **Option 2: left and right parietal bones.**  
  - **Incorrect.** The suture that connects the left and right parietal bones is the **sagittal suture**, not the coronal suture.
  
- **Option 3: parietal and occipital bones.**  
  - **Incorrect.** The **lambdoid suture** connects the parietal bones to the occipital bone.
  
- **Option 4: parietal, squamous temporal and greater wing of the sphenoid.**  
  - **Incorrect.** The coronal suture does not connect these bones. These bones are involved in other sutures or articulations.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which bones are joined by the coronal suture. This requires knowledge of skull anatomy, specifically the sutures and their associated bones.  

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- The **coronal suture** is a type of fibrous joint (suture) found in the skull.  
- Skull sutures are named based on their location and the bones they connect.  
- The **frontal bone** forms the forehead and orbits, while the **parietal bones** form the upper sides and roof of the skull.  
- The **sagittal suture** (not listed as an option here) unites the two parietal bones along the midline.  
- The **lambdoid suture** unites the parietal and occipital bones.  
- The **squamous sutures** (temporoparietal sutures) join the temporal and parietal bones.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Frontal and parietal bones**: Correct. The coronal suture specifically connects the frontal bone anteriorly to the paired parietal bones posteriorly.  
2. **Left and right parietal bones**: Incorrect. This describes the **sagittal suture**, not the coronal suture.  
3. **Parietal and occipital bones**: Incorrect. This describes the **lambdoid suture**.  
4. **Parietal, squamous temporal, and greater wing of the sphenoid**: Incorrect. This combination is not anatomically accurate. The squamous suture involves the parietal and temporal bones, while the greater wing of the sphenoid contributes to the pterion (a region, not a suture).  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks which bones are connected by the coronal suture. This requires identifying the specific cranial bones joined by this suture.

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- **Coronal suture**: A dense, fibrous connective tissue joint that forms part of the skull’s calvaria.  
- **Frontal bone**: Forms the forehead and superior orbital regions.  
- **Parietal bones**: Paired bones forming the majority of the skull’s roof and sides.  
- Sutures are named based on their location and orientation. The coronal suture is oriented coronally (front-to-back direction) and separates the frontal bone from the paired parietal bones.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: *Frontal and parietal bones.*  
  Correct. The coronal suture is located between the frontal bone anteriorly and the two parietal bones posteriorly.  
- **Option 2**: *Left and right parietal bones.*  
  Incorrect. The sagittal suture connects the left and right parietal bones along the midline.  
- **Option 3**: *Parietal and occipital bones.*  
  Incorrect. The lambdoid suture connects the parietal bones to the occipital bone.  
- **Option 4**: *Parietal, squamous temporal, and greater wing of the sphenoid.*  
  Incorrect. This describes the junction near the pterion (where parietal, temporal, sphenoid, and frontal bones meet), not the coronal suture.  

**4. Final Selection**  
- The coronal suture is anatomically defined as the articulation between the frontal and parietal bones. No other option aligns with this definition.  

**My final selection is: Option 1**
