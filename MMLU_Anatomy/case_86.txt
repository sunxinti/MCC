================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is inquiring about the accurate statement related to the postnatal growth of the maxilla, focusing on anatomical changes and processes that occur after birth.

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- **Maxillary Sinus Pneumatisation**: Refers to the development and expansion of the maxillary sinus.
- **Eruption of Permanent Molars**: Involves the movement of permanent molars into the dental arch, requiring space within the maxilla.
- **Zygomaticomaxillary Suture**: A fibrous joint between the zygomatic bone and the maxilla that contributes to maxillary growth.
- **Intermaxillary Suture**: The midline suture between the two maxillae that eventually fuses.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Pneumatisation by enlargement of the developing maxillary sinus ceases at puberty**  
   - **Incorrect**. The pneumatization of the maxillary sinus continues into adulthood and does not cease strictly at puberty.

2. **Space is created for the eruption of the permanent molars by resorption of the maxillary tuberosity**  
   - **Incorrect**. The eruption of permanent molars is primarily facilitated by the growth of the alveolar bone and remodeling, not specifically by the resorption of the maxillary tuberosity.

3. **The zygomaticomaxillary sutures contribute to increase in height and length of the maxilla**  
   - **Correct**. The zygomaticomaxillary sutures play a significant role in the lateral and downward growth of the maxilla, contributing to its overall height and length during postnatal development.

4. **The intermaxillary suture closes about eight years postnatally**  
   - **Incorrect**. The intermaxillary suture (midpalatal suture) typically fuses much later, often during late adolescence or early adulthood, not as early as eight years postnatally.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks about the postnatal growth mechanisms of the maxilla, specifically identifying which statement is accurate regarding its development, including processes like pneumatisation, resorption, suture contributions, and suture closure timing.

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- **Maxillary Sinus Pneumatisation:** The maxillary sinus develops postnatally and enlarges through resorption of surrounding bone. This process continues beyond puberty until adulthood.  
- **Permanent Molar Eruption:** Permanent molars erupt posterior to the primary molars, so space for them is created by jaw growth, not resorption of the maxillary tuberosity.  
- **Zygomaticomaxillary Sutures:** These sutures (between the zygomatic bone and maxilla) allow for anteroposterior (length) and vertical (height) growth of the maxilla through sutural widening.  
- **Intermaxillary Suture Closure:** The intermaxillary suture (median palatine suture) typically closes early in childhood, usually by age 4–7 years, as the two maxillary bones fuse at the midline.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1:** Incorrect. Pneumatisation of the maxillary sinus does not cease at puberty. It continues throughout childhood and even into early adulthood as the sinus cavity expands.  
- **Option 2:** Incorrect. The maxillary tuberosity resorption is not the primary mechanism for creating space for permanent molars. Space for molars arises from forward growth of the jaw, while tuberosity resorption occurs later (e.g., during third molar eruption) and is unrelated to molar eruption.  
- **Option 3:** Correct. The zygomaticomaxillary sutures contribute to the maxilla’s anteroposterior length and vertical height through sutural growth. These sutures act as growth centers, allowing the maxilla to expand as the facial skeleton develops.  
- **Option 4:** Incorrect. The intermaxillary suture closes much earlier, typically by ages 4–7, not around 8 years postnatally. Closure occurs as the two halves of the maxilla fuse during early childhood.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question focuses on identifying the correct statement regarding postnatal growth of the maxilla, emphasizing anatomical processes such as pneumatisation, sutural contributions, resorption, and suture closure timing.  

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- **Maxillary sinus pneumatisation**: Continues beyond puberty, with gradual enlargement into adulthood.  
- **Maxillary tuberosity**: Grows via posterior bone deposition (not resorption) to accommodate permanent molars.  
- **Zygomaticomaxillary suture**: Contributes to downward and forward growth of the maxilla, affecting height and length.  
- **Intermaxillary suture**: Fuses much later (late teens to early 20s), not at eight years postnatally.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Incorrect. Pneumatisation of the maxillary sinus persists into adulthood, though most active in childhood.  
- **Option 2**: Incorrect. Space for permanent molars is created by posterior deposition (not resorption) of the maxillary tuberosity.  
- **Option 3**: Correct. The zygomaticomaxillary suture facilitates bone deposition, increasing maxillary height and length.  
- **Option 4**: Incorrect. The intermaxillary suture closes in late adolescence/early adulthood, not at eight years.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  
The zygomaticomaxillary sutures actively contribute to postnatal maxillary growth by enabling downward and forward displacement, directly increasing both height and length of the maxilla. This aligns with the role of sutural growth in craniofacial development.
