**1. Question Analysis**  
The question is inquiring about the specific nutrient that is acted upon by an enzyme present in saliva. It focuses on identifying which type of nutrient (starches, proteins, fats, or minerals) is broken down by salivary enzymes during the initial stages of digestion.

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
Saliva is produced by salivary glands and contains several components, including enzymes that initiate the digestive process. The primary enzyme in saliva is **salivary amylase** (also known as ptyalin), which begins the chemical digestion of carbohydrates, specifically **starches**, by breaking them down into simpler sugars like maltose. While saliva also contains other enzymes, their roles in nutrient digestion are minimal compared to amylase. For instance, **lingual lipase** is present but plays a minor role in fat digestion, and there are no significant enzymes in saliva that act on proteins or minerals.

**3. Analysis of Options**  

1. **Starches**  
   - **Correct.** Salivary amylase specifically targets starches, initiating their breakdown into simpler carbohydrates during the digestive process in the mouth.

2. **Proteins**  
   - **Incorrect.** Protein digestion primarily begins in the stomach with the enzyme pepsin. Saliva does not contain significant enzymes that act on proteins.

3. **Fats**  
   - **Incorrect.** While saliva contains lingual lipase, its role in fat digestion is minimal and not the primary function of salivary enzymes.

4. **Minerals**  
   - **Incorrect.** Minerals are inorganic and are not broken down by enzymes. Their absorption occurs later in the digestive tract without enzymatic action.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks which nutrient is acted upon by an enzyme in saliva. It requires knowledge of digestive enzymes and their specific substrates.  

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- Saliva is produced by salivary glands (e.g., parotid, submandibular, sublingual) and contains the enzyme **salivary amylase** (ptyalin).  
- **Salivary amylase** initiates the chemical digestion of **starches** (a type of carbohydrate) by breaking them into smaller sugars like maltose.  
- Other digestive enzymes (e.g., proteases for proteins or lipases for fats) are not present in significant quantities in saliva. Proteases like pepsin act in the stomach, and lipases (e.g., pancreatic lipase) act in the small intestine.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Starches):** Correct. Salivary amylase specifically hydrolyzes starch into maltose and maltotriose.  
- **Option 2 (Proteins):** Incorrect. Proteins are digested primarily by gastric proteases (e.g., pepsin) in the stomach, not by enzymes in saliva.  
- **Option 3 (Fats):** Incorrect. Fats are digested by pancreatic lipase in the small intestine; no significant lipase activity occurs in saliva.  
- **Option 4 (Minerals):** Incorrect. Minerals are inorganic ions (e.g., calcium, iron) and are not broken down by enzymes. They are absorbed directly.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks which nutrient is acted upon by an enzyme present in saliva. This requires knowledge of digestive enzymes secreted in the oral cavity and their substrates.  

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- Saliva contains **salivary amylase** (ptyalin), an enzyme produced by the salivary glands.  
- Amylase specifically catalyzes the hydrolysis of **starch** (a polysaccharide) into smaller carbohydrates like maltose and dextrins.  
- Proteins are primarily digested by proteases (e.g., pepsin, trypsin), which are not present in saliva.  
- Fats are digested by lipases, but lingual lipase (active in the stomach) is minimal in saliva and not the primary enzyme.  
- Minerals are inorganic and not enzymatically broken down.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Starches**  
  Correct. Salivary amylase initiates starch digestion in the mouth.  
- **Option 2: Proteins**  
  Incorrect. Saliva lacks proteolytic enzymes; protein digestion begins in the stomach.  
- **Option 3: Fats**  
  Incorrect. Fat digestion primarily occurs in the small intestine via pancreatic lipase. Lingual lipase in saliva is negligible and inactive in the oral cavity.  
- **Option 4: Minerals**  
  Incorrect. Minerals are absorbed directly and do not require enzymatic breakdown.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**  
Salivary amylase is the enzyme in saliva that specifically targets starches, initiating their digestion into simpler carbohydrates. No other enzymes in saliva act on proteins, fats, or minerals.
