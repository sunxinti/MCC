**1. Question Analysis**
- The question asks which anatomical region of the abdomen is located just distal (i.e., directly below) to the sternum. This requires identifying the specific abdominal region that lies immediately beneath the sternum.

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**
- The abdomen is divided into nine regions using two vertical and two horizontal lines, creating areas such as the epigastric, hypochondriac, lumbar, umbilical, and hypogastric regions.
- The **epigastric region** is the central upper section of the abdomen, situated just below the sternum.
- The **hypochondriac regions** are located on either side of the epigastric region, beneath the lower ribs.
- The **hypogastric region** is situated below the umbilical region towards the lower abdomen.
- The **lumbar regions** are located on both the left and right sides of the abdomen, below the umbilical region and above the inguinal regions.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Epigastric**
   - **Correct**: This region is directly below the sternum in the central upper part of the abdomen.
2. **Hypochondriac**
   - **Incorrect**: These regions are located on the sides of the epigastric region, beneath the lower ribs, not directly below the sternum.
3. **Hypogastric**
   - **Incorrect**: This region is in the lower central part of the abdomen, well below the area directly beneath the sternum.
4. **Lumbar**
   - **Incorrect**: These regions are situated on the sides of the lower abdomen and back, not near the sternum.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks for the abdominal region located immediately inferior (distal) to the sternum. It requires knowledge of the standard abdominal regional divisions and their positions relative to the thoracic skeleton.

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- The abdomen is divided into nine regions using horizontal and vertical planes. The **epigastric region** is situated above the umbilical region and directly inferior to the xiphoid process of the sternum.  
- The **hypochondriac regions** (right and left) lie lateral to the epigastric region and are associated with the costal margins (ribs 8–10).  
- The **hypogastric (pubic) region** is the lowest abdominal region, located inferior to the umbilical region and overlying the pubic symphysis.  
- The **lumbar regions** are located lateral to the umbilical region and are flanked by the lumbar vertebrae.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Epigastric):** Correct. The epigastric region is directly inferior to the xiphoid process of the sternum and is the anatomical region immediately distal to the sternum.  
- **Option 2 (Hypochondriac):** Incorrect. The hypochondriac regions are lateral to the epigastric region and lie under the rib cage (costal margins), not directly inferior to the sternum.  
- **Option 3 (Hypogastric):** Incorrect. The hypogastric region is the lowest abdominal region, located near the pubic bone, far inferior to the sternum.  
- **Option 4 (Lumbar):** Incorrect. The lumbar regions are lateral to the umbilical region and correspond to the area over the lumbar vertebrae, not directly below the sternum.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks for the anatomical region of the abdomen located immediately distal (inferior) to the sternum. This requires understanding the standard divisions of the abdominal regions and their spatial relationships to the sternum.

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- The abdomen is divided into nine regions using two vertical midclavicular lines and two horizontal planes (subcostal and transtubercular).  
- The **epigastric region** is centrally located between the costal margins, directly inferior to the sternum.  
- The **hypochondriac regions** (right and left) lie lateral to the epigastric region, beneath the ribcage.  
- The **hypogastric region** is the central inferior region, near the pubic symphysis.  
- The **lumbar regions** are lateral to the umbilical region, flanking the midline.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Epigastric**  
  - Correct. The epigastric region is centrally positioned immediately inferior to the sternum, spanning the area overlying the stomach and part of the liver.  

- **Option 2: Hypochondriac**  
  - Incorrect. The hypochondriac regions are lateral to the epigastric region, beneath the lower ribs, and not directly distal to the sternum.  

- **Option 3: Hypogastric**  
  - Incorrect. The hypogastric region is located inferiorly near the pelvis, far removed from the sternum.  

- **Option 4: Lumbar**  
  - Incorrect. The lumbar regions are lateral to the umbilical region, positioned more posteriorly and unrelated to the sternum.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The epigastric region is the anatomical area directly inferior to the sternum, making it the correct answer.  

**My final selection is: Option 1**
