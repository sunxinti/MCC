**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks about the direction of movement when the foot is abducted. It requires understanding the anatomical terminology related to limb movements, specifically regarding the foot's movement relative to the body's midline.

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
Abduction is a term used in anatomy to describe the movement of a limb away from the body's midline. In the context of the foot, abduction refers to moving the foot laterally, away from the central line of the body. This movement is controlled by specific muscles in the lower leg and foot, such as the peroneus longus and brevis. Understanding the distinction between abduction and adduction (movement toward the midline) is crucial for accurately determining the direction of the foot's movement.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1. Inward**  
  *Incorrect.* Inward movement refers to adduction, which is the opposite of abduction.
  
- **Option 2. Outward**  
  *Correct.* Outward movement aligns with the definition of abduction, which involves moving the foot away from the body's midline.
  
- **Option 3. Upward**  
  *Incorrect.* Upward movement does not pertain to the lateral or medial direction changes associated with abduction.
  
- **Option 4. Downward**  
  *Incorrect.* Downward movement is unrelated to the lateral displacement that characterizes abduction.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks about the directional movement of the foot during abduction. It requires understanding anatomical terms of motion, specifically the definition of "abduction" as it applies to the foot.  

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- **Anatomical Position**: The standard reference for movement terms assumes the body is in the anatomical position (standing upright, arms at sides, palms forward).  
- **Abduction/Adduction**: These terms describe movements away from (abduction) or toward (adduction) the body's midline. For the foot, the midline is aligned with the leg.  
- **Foot Movements**:  
  - **Abduction**: Lateral movement of the foot away from the midline (e.g., turning the sole outward).  
  - **Adduction**: Medial movement of the foot toward the midline (e.g., turning the sole inward).  
  - **Flexion/Extension**: These involve upward/downward movements in the sagittal plane (e.g., pointing/toes up/down).  
  - **Inversion/Eversion**: Movements around the anterior-posterior axis (sole turning inward/outward), but these are distinct from abduction/adduction.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Inward)**: Incorrect. This describes adduction, the movement of the foot toward the body's midline.  
- **Option 2 (Outward)**: Correct. Abduction of the foot moves it away from the midline, which is outward.  
- **Option 3 (Upward)**: Incorrect. This refers to dorsiflexion (flexion at the ankle), not abduction.  
- **Option 4 (Downward)**: Incorrect. This refers to plantarflexion (extension at the ankle), not abduction.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  
- Abduction of the foot is defined as movement away from the body's midline, which translates to an outward direction. This aligns with anatomical terminology and the frontal plane motion of the foot.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks about the direction of movement when the foot is abducted. It tests understanding of anatomical terminology related to directional movements, specifically "abduction."  

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- **Abduction** refers to movement away from the midline (median plane) of the body. For limbs, this typically means moving laterally.  
- In the context of the foot, abduction (also called *lateral deviation*) involves moving the forefoot or toes away from the midline (e.g., splaying the toes outward).  
- **Adduction** (movement toward the midline) and **inversion/eversion** (sole turning inward/outward) are distinct concepts and should not be conflated with abduction.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Inward**  
  Incorrect. Inward movement of the foot toward the midline is **adduction**, not abduction.  
- **Option 2: Outward**  
  Correct. Abduction involves moving the foot or toes laterally (outward) away from the midline.  
- **Option 3: Upward**  
  Incorrect. Upward movement of the foot (dorsiflexion) occurs at the ankle joint and is unrelated to abduction.  
- **Option 4: Downward**  
  Incorrect. Downward movement (plantarflexion) also occurs at the ankle and does not describe abduction.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The correct answer aligns with the definition of abduction as movement away from the midline. The foot moves outward in this context.  

**My final selection is: Option 2**
