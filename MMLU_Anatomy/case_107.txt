**1. Question Analysis**  
The question is asking about the specific locations of proprioceptive nerve endings within synovial joints. Proprioceptive nerve endings are responsible for providing the brain with information about joint position, movement, and tension, which are crucial for coordinated movement and balance.

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
Proprioception in synovial joints is mediated by specialized nerve endings that detect changes in joint position and movement. The primary locations of these proprioceptive receptors include:

- **Joint Capsule:** The fibrous capsule surrounding the joint contains nerve endings that monitor the position and movement of the joint.
- **Ligaments:** These connective tissues not only stabilize joints but also contain proprioceptors that provide feedback on joint tension and movement.
- **Articular Discs (in some joints):** These structures can also house proprioceptive nerve endings, contributing to the sensory feedback mechanism.

It is less common for proprioceptive nerve endings to be located in the synovial membrane or articular cartilage, as these structures are primarily involved in producing synovial fluid and providing a smooth surface for joint movement, respectively.

**3. Analysis of Options**

1. **Articular cartilage and synovial membrane.**
   - *Articular Cartilage:* Primarily involved in reducing friction and absorbing shock; not a primary site for proprioceptive nerve endings.
   - *Synovial Membrane:* Produces synovial fluid; contains some nerve endings but not predominantly for proprioception.
   - **Evaluation:** Partially incorrect.

2. **Synovial membrane and capsule.**
   - *Synovial Membrane:* Limited proprioceptive innervation.
   - *Capsule:* Contains proprioceptive nerve endings.
   - **Evaluation:** Partially correct but incomplete regarding key structures.

3. **Capsule and ligaments.**
   - *Capsule:* Rich in proprioceptive nerve endings.
   - *Ligaments:* Contain significant proprioceptive receptors.
   - **Evaluation:** Fully correct, encompassing the primary locations of proprioceptive nerve endings in synovial joints.

4. **Ligaments and articular discs.**
   - *Ligaments:* Contain proprioceptive nerve endings.
   - *Articular Discs:* May contain some proprioceptors but are not primary sites.
   - **Evaluation:** Partially correct but less comprehensive than Option 3.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks about the location of proprioceptive nerve endings within synovial joints. Proprioception refers to the sense of body position and movement, which relies on specialized nerve endings (mechanoreceptors) that detect joint position, tension, and movement. The options list various joint structures, and the task is to identify which pair correctly houses these nerve endings.

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- **Proprioceptive nerve endings**: These include mechanoreceptors such as Ruffini endings, Pacinian corpuscles, and Golgi tendon organs. They detect joint stretch, pressure, and tension.  
- **Articular cartilage**: Avascular and generally **not innervated**, serving primarily to reduce friction and absorb shock.  
- **Synovial membrane**: Produces synovial fluid and lines the joint cavity. It contains some nerve endings but is not the primary site for proprioception.  
- **Joint capsule**: Composed of an outer fibrous layer and inner synovial membrane. The **fibrous layer** contains dense connective tissue with proprioceptive nerve endings that detect joint movement and stretch.  
- **Ligaments**: Dense fibrous connective tissue structures stabilizing joints. They contain **Golgi tendon organs** and other mechanoreceptors that monitor tension and joint position.  
- **Articular discs (menisci)**: Fibrocartilaginous structures that may have some innervation but are secondary to capsules and ligaments in proprioception.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Articular cartilage and synovial membrane**: Incorrect. Articular cartilage lacks nerve endings. While the synovial membrane has some nerves, it is not a primary proprioceptive site.  
2. **Synovial membrane and capsule**: Partially correct but incomplete. The synovial membrane’s role in proprioception is minor compared to the fibrous capsule layer, which contains dense nerve endings.  
3. **Capsule and ligaments**: Correct. The fibrous layer of the joint capsule and ligaments are primary sites for proprioceptive nerve endings (e.g., Ruffini endings in the capsule and Golgi tendon organs in ligaments).  
4. **Ligaments and articular discs**: Partially correct. Ligaments are correct, but articular discs are not a primary proprioceptive structure.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  

**Explanation**: Proprioceptive nerve endings are primarily located in the **fibrous layer of the joint capsule** and **ligaments**, which contain mechanoreceptors that detect joint position and movement. Articular cartilage lacks nerve endings, and while the synovial membrane has some nerves, it is not a major site for proprioception. Ligaments and the joint capsule are the most accurate answer.

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks for the specific location of proprioceptive nerve endings within synovial joints. Proprioceptors detect mechanical changes (e.g., stretch, tension) to relay information about joint position and movement.  

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- **Synovial Joint Structures**:  
  - **Articular Cartilage**: Avascular and aneural; lacks nerve endings.  
  - **Synovial Membrane**: Secretes synovial fluid; not densely innervated by proprioceptors.  
  - **Capsule**: Composed of an outer **fibrous layer** (rich in sensory nerves, including proprioceptors like Ruffini endings) and an inner synovial membrane.  
  - **Ligaments**: Dense connective tissue connecting bones; contain mechanoreceptors (e.g., Golgi tendon organs, Ruffini endings) for detecting tension and joint position.  
  - **Articular Discs**: Fibrocartilage structures (e.g., menisci); limited proprioceptive innervation compared to ligaments and capsule.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (articular cartilage and synovial membrane)**: Incorrect. Articular cartilage lacks nerves, and the synovial membrane primarily serves secretory functions.  
- **Option 2 (synovial membrane and capsule)**: Partially correct but misleading. The synovial membrane lacks proprioceptors, while the **fibrous layer of the capsule** is proprioceptive.  
- **Option 3 (capsule and ligaments)**: Correct. The fibrous capsule and ligaments are densely innervated with proprioceptors (e.g., Ruffini endings in the capsule, Golgi organs in ligaments).  
- **Option 4 (ligaments and articular discs)**: Partially correct but suboptimal. Ligaments contain proprioceptors, but articular discs have limited innervation compared to the capsule.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The capsule (specifically its fibrous layer) and ligaments are the primary sites of proprioceptive nerve endings in synovial joints, as they directly sense mechanical changes during joint movement.  

**My final selection is: Option 3**
