**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is inquiring about a specific substance that facilitates the transmission of nerve impulses to muscles. This pertains to the biochemical processes at the neuromuscular junction, where nerve cells communicate with muscle fibers to induce contraction.

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- **Neuromuscular Transmission:** This process involves the release of neurotransmitters from motor neurons, which then bind to receptors on muscle cells to trigger contraction.
- **Neurotransmitters:** Acetylcholine is the primary neurotransmitter responsible for transmitting nerve impulses at the neuromuscular junction.
- **Other Substances:**
  - **Cholecystokinin:** A hormone involved in digestion.
  - **Deoxyribose:** A sugar component of DNA.
  - **Oxytocin:** A hormone related to social bonding and reproductive functions.

**3. Analysis of Options**

1. **Acetylcholine**
   - **Correct.** Acetylcholine is the key neurotransmitter that transmits nerve impulses from motor neurons to muscle fibers, enabling muscle contraction.
   
2. **Cholecystokinin**
   - **Incorrect.** This is a digestive hormone that stimulates the digestion of fat and protein.
   
3. **Deoxyribose**
   - **Incorrect.** It is a sugar molecule that is a component of DNA, not involved in nerve impulse transmission.
   
4. **Oxytocin**
   - **Incorrect.** Oxytocin is a hormone involved in childbirth, lactation, and social bonding, not in neuromuscular transmission.

**4. Final Selection**
- **My final selection is: Option 1**

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks for a substance involved in transmitting nerve impulses to muscles. This relates to neuromuscular junctions, where motor neurons communicate with muscle fibers to initiate contraction. The key concept is identifying the neurotransmitter responsible for this specific signaling process.

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- **Neuromuscular Junction**: The site where motor neurons release neurotransmitters to stimulate muscle contraction.  
- **Neurotransmitter Function**: The correct answer must be a neurotransmitter specifically involved in transmitting signals from neurons to muscle cells.  
- **Acetylcholine**: Known as the primary neurotransmitter at neuromuscular junctions, it binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on muscle cells, triggering depolarization and muscle contraction.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Acetylcholine)**: Correct. It is the neurotransmitter released by motor neurons at the neuromuscular junction to initiate muscle contraction.  
- **Option 2 (Cholecystokinin)**: Incorrect. A hormone involved in digestion, released by the small intestine to stimulate bile and enzyme secretion. Unrelated to nerve-muscle transmission.  
- **Option 3 (Deoxyribose)**: Incorrect. A component of DNA’s backbone, not a signaling molecule. Plays no role in nerve impulses.  
- **Option 4 (Oxytocin)**: Incorrect. A hormone involved in childbirth, lactation, and social bonding. Acts on target organs via endocrine pathways, not at neuromuscular junctions.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks for a substance that facilitates the transmission of nerve impulses to muscles, focusing on the neuromuscular junction and neurotransmitter function.  

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- Nerve impulses are transmitted to muscles via neurotransmitters released at neuromuscular junctions.  
- Acetylcholine (ACh) is the primary neurotransmitter responsible for initiating muscle contraction by binding to receptors on muscle cells.  
- Other substances listed (e.g., hormones, sugars) are unrelated to neuromuscular signaling.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Acetylcholine**  
  Correct. Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter released by motor neurons at neuromuscular junctions, directly triggering muscle contraction.  
- **Option 2: Cholecystokinin**  
  Incorrect. A digestive hormone that stimulates bile and pancreatic enzyme secretion; no role in neuromuscular transmission.  
- **Option 3: Deoxyribose**  
  Incorrect. A sugar component of DNA, unrelated to nerve impulse transmission.  
- **Option 4: Oxytocin**  
  Incorrect. A hormone involved in uterine contractions and lactation, not neuromuscular signaling.  

**4. Final Selection**  
- Acetylcholine is the only substance directly involved in transmitting nerve impulses to muscles. The other options are unrelated to this specific physiological process.  

**My final selection is: Option 1**
