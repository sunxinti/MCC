**1. Question Analysis**
- The question is assessing knowledge of the neural pathways responsible for somatic (general) sensation in specific regions of the tongue. Specifically, it focuses on identifying which nerve, when damaged, would result in the loss of somatic sensation over the anterior two-thirds of the tongue.

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**
- **Tongue Innervation:**
  - **Anterior Two-Thirds:**
    - *General Somatic Sensation:* Mediated by the **lingual nerve**, a branch of the mandibular division (V3) of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V).
    - *Taste Sensation:* Mediated by the **chorda tympani**, a branch of the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII).
  - **Posterior One-Third:**
    - *General Somatic Sensation and Taste:* Mediated by the glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX).
- **Other Relevant Nerves:**
  - **Hypoglossal Nerve:** Primarily responsible for motor control of the tongue; does not carry sensory information.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Lingual branch of the mandibular trigeminal nerve.**
   - **Correct.** The lingual nerve provides general somatic sensory innervation to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. Damage to this nerve would result in loss of somatic sensation in this region.
   
2. **Chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve.**
   - **Incorrect.** While the chorda tympani carries taste fibers from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, it does not handle general somatic sensation.
   
3. **Lingual branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve.**
   - **Incorrect.** The glossopharyngeal nerve innervates the posterior one-third of the tongue, not the anterior two-thirds.
   
4. **Hypoglossal nerve.**
   - **Incorrect.** The hypoglossal nerve is responsible for motor control of the tongue and does not carry sensory fibers.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks which nerve's damage would result in loss of **somatic sensation** (e.g., touch, pain) over the **anterior two-thirds of the tongue**.  
- Key concepts involve understanding the sensory innervation pathways of the tongue and distinguishing between somatic sensation versus taste or motor functions.  

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- **Trigeminal Nerve (CN V):**  
  - The mandibular division (V3) includes the **lingual nerve**, which provides **general somatic sensation** (touch, pain, temperature) to the **anterior two-thirds of the tongue**.  
- **Facial Nerve (CN VII):**  
  - The **chorda tympani** branch carries **taste fibers** from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue but does not supply somatic sensation.  
- **Glossopharyngeal Nerve (CN IX):**  
  - Provides **general somatic sensation** to the **posterior third of the tongue** via its lingual branch.  
- **Hypoglossal Nerve (CN XII):**  
  - Exclusively controls **motor innervation** to all intrinsic and most extrinsic tongue muscles; it does not contribute to sensation.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (lingual branch of the mandibular trigeminal nerve):**  
  - **Correct.** The lingual nerve (branch of V3) is the primary sensory supply for the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. Damage here would directly cause loss of somatic sensation.  
- **Option 2 (chorda tympani of facial nerve):**  
  - **Incorrect.** The chorda tympani carries **taste** (special visceral sensory) fibers, not somatic sensation. Its involvement would affect taste, not touch/pain.  
- **Option 3 (lingual branch of glossopharyngeal nerve):**  
  - **Incorrect.** This nerve serves the **posterior third** of the tongue, not the anterior two-thirds.  
- **Option 4 (hypoglossal nerve):**  
  - **Incorrect.** The hypoglossal nerve is purely **motor**; it does not contribute to sensory pathways.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks which nerve damage causes loss of somatic (general) sensation in the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. This requires understanding the sensory innervation of the tongue.  

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- **Somatic sensation** (touch, pain, temperature) in the anterior two-thirds of the tongue is mediated by the **lingual nerve**, a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V3).  
- **Taste sensation** for the same region is provided by the **chorda tympani** (a branch of the facial nerve, CN VII), which joins the lingual nerve but does not contribute to somatic sensation.  
- The glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) innervates the posterior one-third of the tongue for both somatic and taste sensation.  
- The hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) is purely motor, controlling tongue movement.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Correct. The lingual nerve (CN V3) is responsible for general sensory innervation of the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. Damage here directly causes somatic sensory loss.  
- **Option 2**: Incorrect. The chorda tympani (CN VII) carries taste and parasympathetic fibers but does not mediate somatic sensation. Its damage would affect taste, not general sensation.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. The glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) innervates the posterior one-third of the tongue, not the anterior region.  
- **Option 4**: Incorrect. The hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) is motor; damage would impair tongue movement, not sensation.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**  
The anterior two-thirds of the tongue’s somatic sensation is exclusively supplied by the lingual nerve (CN V3). Other options either relate to taste, motor function, or the posterior tongue, making Option 1 the only anatomically accurate answer.
