**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is asking about the specific anatomical structure within the female reproductive system where the fertilization of an ovum by a spermatozoon takes place.

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- **Ovary**: Produces ova (eggs) but is not the site of fertilization.
- **Fallopian Tube (Ampulla)**: The typical location where fertilization occurs. It transports the ova from the ovary to the uterus and is the site where sperm meets the ovum.
- **Uterus**: Site for implantation and development of the embryo, not the primary site of fertilization.
- **Cervix**: The lower part of the uterus that opens into the vagina; it facilitates sperm entry but is not where fertilization occurs.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1. Cervix**: Incorrect. While it allows sperm to enter the reproductive tract, fertilization does not occur here.
- **Option 2. Fallopian tube**: Correct. Specifically, fertilization typically occurs in the ampulla region of the fallopian tube.
- **Option 3. Ovary**: Incorrect. The ovary releases the ovum but does not facilitate fertilization.
- **Option 4. Uterus**: Incorrect. The uterus is involved in pregnancy maintenance, not the initial fertilization process.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks for the anatomical location where fertilization of an ovum by a spermatozoon occurs. This requires knowledge of the female reproductive system and the pathways of gametes during conception.

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- **Ovum Release**: The ovum is released from the **ovary** during ovulation and is captured by the **fimbriae** (finger-like projections) of the **fallopian tube**.  
- **Sperm Journey**: Sperm travel from the **vagina** through the **cervix** and into the **uterus**, then move upward into the **fallopian tubes**.  
- **Fertilization Site**: Fertilization typically occurs in the **ampulla** region of the **fallopian tube**, where the sperm penetrates the ovum.  
- **Post-Fertilization Pathway**: The resulting zygote then travels down the fallopian tube and implants in the **uterine lining** (endometrium).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Cervix)**: Incorrect. The cervix is the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina. While sperm pass through the cervix en route to the fallopian tubes, fertilization does not occur here.  
- **Option 2 (Fallopian tube)**: Correct. This is the anatomically accurate site of fertilization. The ovum is transported here after ovulation, and sperm meet the ovum in the ampulla of the tube.  
- **Option 3 (Ovary)**: Incorrect. The ovary releases the ovum but is not the site of fertilization. Fertilization occurs after the ovum is swept into the fallopian tube.  
- **Option 4 (Uterus)**: Incorrect. The uterus is where the fertilized egg (zygote) implants and develops into a fetus, but fertilization itself does not occur here.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

DeepSeek的完整回答:
================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks for the anatomical structure where fertilization (union of sperm and ovum) occurs. This requires knowledge of the female reproductive tract and the physiological sequence of events during conception.

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- **Ovulation**: The ovum is released from the ovary into the peritoneal cavity and captured by the fimbriae of the **fallopian tube** (uterine tube).  
- **Sperm migration**: Sperm travel through the vagina, cervix, uterus, and into the fallopian tubes to reach the ovum.  
- **Fertilization site**: Fertilization typically occurs in the **ampulla** (widest section) of the fallopian tube, where the sperm penetrates the ovum.  
- **Post-fertilization**: The zygote then moves toward the uterus for implantation.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Cervix**  
  Incorrect. The cervix is the lower portion of the uterus connecting to the vagina. It allows sperm passage but is not involved in fertilization.  
- **Option 2: Fallopian tube**  
  Correct. Fertilization occurs in the fallopian tube’s ampulla, where the sperm and ovum meet after ovulation.  
- **Option 3: Ovary**  
  Incorrect. The ovary releases the ovum but does not host fertilization. Sperm cannot reach the ovary due to anatomical barriers.  
- **Option 4: Uterus**  
  Incorrect. The uterus is the site of embryo implantation, not fertilization. By the time the zygote reaches the uterus, fertilization has already occurred.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  
Fertilization occurs in the fallopian tube, specifically its ampullary region, where sperm and ovum meet post-ovulation. This aligns with the physiological sequence of reproductive events.
