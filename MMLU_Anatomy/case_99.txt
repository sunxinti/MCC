**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is assessing the palpability of an enlarged submandibular salivary gland. It seeks to determine whether the gland can be felt intraorally (inside the mouth), extraorally (outside the mouth), both, or if it requires radiographical methods for detection.

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- **Submandibular Gland Location:** The submandibular glands are located beneath the lower jaw (mandible) in an area known as the submandibular triangle.
- **Palpation Sites:**
  - **Intraoral Palpation:** The gland can be felt inside the mouth, specifically on the floor of the mouth, near the lingual side of the mandible.
  - **Extraoral Palpation:** Externally, the gland lies just below the jawline and can be felt through the skin in the submandibular region.
- **Enlargement Implications:** When enlarged, the submandibular gland becomes more palpable both intraorally and extraorally due to its increased size.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: to be palpable intraorally.**  
  - *Correct.* An enlarged submandibular gland can be felt inside the mouth on the floor of the mouth.
  
- **Option 2: to be palpable extraorally.**  
  - *Correct.* The gland can also be felt externally beneath the jawline in the submandibular area.
  
- **Option 3: to be palpable both intra- and extraorally.**  
  - *Correct.* Given that the gland can be felt both inside the mouth and beneath the jawline when enlarged, this option is accurate.
  
- **Option 4: only to be detectable by radiographical examination.**  
  - *Incorrect.* Palpation is a primary method for detecting an enlarged submandibular gland; radiography is not the only means of detection.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks about the palpability of an enlarged submandibular salivary gland, specifically whether it would be detected intraorally, extraorally, both, or only via imaging.  

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- **Submandibular Gland Anatomy**:  
  - The submandibular gland is divided into superficial and deep lobes. The superficial lobe lies within the submandibular triangle (bounded by the mandible, anterior and posterior bellies of the digastric muscle, and the styloid process). The deep lobe is located beneath the mylohyoid muscle.  
  - The gland’s duct (Wharton’s duct) opens at the sublingual caruncle on the floor of the mouth.  
  - The gland’s proximity to the oral cavity (deep lobe) and submandibular space (superficial lobe) allows for palpation both intraorally (floor of the mouth) and extraorally (under the jaw).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (intraorally only)**: Incorrect. While the deep lobe is palpable intraorally, the superficial lobe is accessible externally, so an enlarged gland would typically be palpable both intra- and extraorally.  
- **Option 2 (extraorally only)**: Incorrect. The deep lobe’s proximity to the oral cavity means intraoral palpation is also possible.  
- **Option 3 (both intra- and extraorally)**: Correct. An enlarged submandibular gland can be palpated intraorally (floor of the mouth) and extraorally (submandibular region beneath the jaw).  
- **Option 4 (radiography only)**: Incorrect. The gland’s superficial location makes palpation feasible without imaging.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  
The submandibular gland’s anatomical position allows both intraoral (deep lobe near the floor of the mouth) and extraoral (superficial lobe in the submandibular triangle) palpation when enlarged. This dual accessibility is a defining feature of the gland’s structure.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks where an enlarged submandibular salivary gland would be palpable, focusing on anatomical localization and clinical palpation techniques.

**2. Key Anatomical Considerations**  
- The **submandibular gland** has two parts:  
  - **Superficial part**: Located in the submandibular triangle (below the mandible), covered by the investing layer of deep cervical fascia.  
  - **Deep part**: Extends around the posterior margin of the mylohyoid muscle into the floor of the mouth.  
- **Palpation technique**: Clinically, the gland is assessed bimanually—extraoral palpation below the mandible and intraoral palpation in the floor of the mouth.  
- Enlargement of the gland would affect both regions due to its anatomical division.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Intraorally only)**: Incorrect. While the deep portion of the gland is accessible intraorally, the superficial part under the mandible cannot be ignored in enlargement.  
- **Option 2 (Extraorally only)**: Incorrect. The deep portion in the floor of the mouth would also become palpable intraorally when enlarged.  
- **Option 3 (Both intra- and extraorally)**: Correct. The gland spans both regions anatomically, and bimanual palpation is standard clinical practice.  
- **Option 4 (Radiographical detection only)**: Incorrect. Palpation is a primary diagnostic method for gland enlargement; imaging is supplementary.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The submandibular gland’s dual anatomical location and bimanual palpation technique confirm that enlargement would be detectable both intra- and extraorally.  

**My final selection is: Option 3**
