**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content:** The question seeks to determine whether a non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patient's self-reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL) serves as an independent prognostic factor for survival.
- **Key Information to Look For:** Evidence from the study showing whether HRQOL measures independently predict survival outcomes in NSCLC patients, including statistical significance and the robustness of the findings.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results and Data:** The study analyzed 391 advanced NSCLC patients using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-LC13 to measure HRQOL. Multivariate Cox regression identified that patients' self-reported scores of pain and dysphagia were significant independent prognostic factors for survival, with hazard ratios of 1.11 and 1.12 respectively (both P < 0.01). A 10-point worsening in these scores increased the likelihood of death by 11% and 12%.
- **Strength and Reliability:** The use of multivariate Cox regression and bootstrap validation techniques strengthens the reliability of the findings, indicating that the results are not due to random chance and are stable.
- **Relevance:** The evidence directly addresses the research question by demonstrating that specific HRQOL measures independently predict survival in NSCLC patients.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the abstract, there is clear scientific evidence that self-reported HRQOL is an independent prognostic factor for survival in NSCLC patients. The statistical significance and methodological rigor support a definitive conclusion.

**4. Final Answer**
**My final choice is: "yes"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether self-reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is an independent prognostic factor for survival in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Key information to assess includes:  
- Whether the study's multivariate analysis identified HRQOL as an independent predictor.  
- Statistical significance (p-values, hazard ratios) of HRQOL parameters.  
- The abstract's conclusion regarding HRQOL's prognostic value.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The abstract states that in the **multivariate Cox regression model**, two HRQOL parameters (pain and dysphagia scores) were independent prognostic factors for survival:  
- Pain: HR = 1.11 (95% CI 1.07–1.16, P < 0.001).  
- Dysphagia: HR = 1.12 (95% CI 1.04–1.21, P = 0.003).  
These associations remained significant after adjusting for other factors like gender and performance status. The study explicitly concludes that "patients' self-reported HRQOL provides independent prognostic information for survival." The sample size (391 patients) and validation via bootstrap techniques further support the reliability of these findings.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study’s multivariate analysis demonstrates that self-reported HRQOL parameters (pain and dysphagia) are independent predictors of survival in NSCLC. The authors explicitly endorse this conclusion, making the evidence strong and directly relevant to the question.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether self-reported HRQOL is an independent prognostic factor for survival in NSCLC patients. Key information to identify includes whether HRQOL measures (e.g., pain, dysphagia) were retained in multivariate analyses as predictors of survival and if the study concludes that HRQOL provides independent prognostic value.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study analyzed 391 advanced NSCLC patients, using validated HRQOL tools (EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-LC13).  
- Multivariate Cox regression identified **pain** and **dysphagia** (self-reported HRQOL domains) as independent prognostic factors for survival, with statistically significant hazard ratios (HR=1.11 and 1.12, respectively).  
- The authors explicitly conclude that HRQOL provides independent prognostic information, supporting its clinical relevance.  
- Methods included rigorous statistical validation (bootstrap), strengthening reliability.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study directly links self-reported HRQOL domains (pain, dysphagia) to survival outcomes in multivariate analyses, confirming their independent prognostic value. The abstract’s conclusion explicitly affirms HRQOL’s role, aligning with the question.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: yes**
DeepSeek selected: yes

Initial consensus: All models selected yes
