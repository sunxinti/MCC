**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content**: The research question investigates whether profound hypotensive events can trigger myocardial ischaemic events in patients with coronary disease.
- **Key Information to Identify**: The association between hypotensive events (both systolic and diastolic) and the occurrence of myocardial ischaemic events, the strength of this association, and any relevant statistical significance presented in the study.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results and Data**: The study documented 107 hypotensive events in 25 patients, with 40 ST events occurring in 14 patients. Specifically, 14 of these were hypotension-induced ischaemic (HII) events in eight patients. The majority of HII events were preceded by a fall in diastolic pressure (13 out of 14), with statistically significant associations (chi² = 40.2, p<0.0001) between hypotensive events and ST events. Additionally, patients experiencing HII events were more likely to be on multiple hypotensive drug regimens (chi² = 5.54, p = 0.022).
- **Strength and Reliability**: The study shows a strong statistical association between hypotensive episodes and ischaemic events, particularly with diastolic hypotension. The p-values indicate high statistical significance, suggesting that the findings are unlikely due to chance.
- **Relevance**: The evidence directly addresses the research question by demonstrating a temporal and statistically significant relationship between profound hypotensive events and myocardial ischaemic events in the studied patient population.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the data presented in the abstract, there is strong evidence to support that profound hypotensive events, especially diastolic hypotension, can cause myocardial ischaemic events in patients with coronary disease.

**4. Final Answer:**
**My final choice is: "yes"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether profound hypotensive events can cause myocardial ischemic events in patients with coronary disease. Key elements to evaluate include:  
- The study's definition of hypotension (systolic/diastolic thresholds during day/night).  
- The association between hypotensive episodes and ischemic events (ST segment changes).  
- Statistical significance and temporal relationship between hypotension and ischemia.  
- The role of hypotensive medications in exacerbating this relationship.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Study Findings**: The abstract reports that 14 "hypotension-induced ischaemic (HII) events" occurred in 8 patients, with 13/14 preceded by diastolic pressure drops (median 57.5 mmHg) and 6/14 preceded by systolic drops. A strong statistical association was found between ST segment ischemic events and preceding hypotension (χ² = 40.2, *p* < 0.0001).  
- **Temporal Relationship**: The study explicitly states that ischemic events occurred *after* hypotensive episodes, supporting a causal link.  
- **Clinical Context**: Patients were on hypotensive drugs, and those with HII events were more likely to use multiple medications (χ² = 5.54, *p* = 0.022), suggesting excessive treatment-induced hypotension may contribute.  
- **Limitations**: The study is observational, so causation cannot be definitively proven. However, the temporal and dose-response (multiple drugs) associations strengthen the inference.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence strongly supports a causal relationship between profound hypotension (particularly diastolic) and myocardial ischemic events in this population. The study’s statistical significance, temporal association, and emphasis on drug-induced hypotension align with the question’s premise. While observational studies cannot confirm causation definitively, the findings strongly suggest that hypotension can trigger ischemia in these patients.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether profound hypotensive events can cause myocardial ischemic events in patients with coronary disease. Key information to evaluate includes:  
- Evidence linking hypotension (specifically systolic/diastolic thresholds) to ischemic events (ST segment changes).  
- Temporal relationship between hypotensive events and ischemia.  
- Statistical significance and clinical relevance of findings.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study identified 14 hypotension-induced ischemic (HII) events in 8/25 patients, with 13/14 HII events preceded by diastolic hypotension (median 57.5 mm Hg). ST events were significantly associated with preceding hypotension (χ² = 40.2, p < 0.0001).  
- Patients with HII events were more likely to be on multiple hypotensive drugs (p = 0.022), suggesting overtreatment as a contributing factor.  
- The temporal sequence (hypotension preceding ischemia) and statistical strength (p < 0.001 for diastolic pressure association) support causality in this population.  
- Limitations include a small, selected cohort and observational design, which cannot fully exclude confounding factors.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence supports a causal relationship between hypotension and myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary disease, particularly when diastolic pressure falls below critical thresholds (e.g., 45–72 mm Hg). The study’s statistical rigor and temporal correlation justify a "yes" answer, though generalizability may be limited by the study’s narrow population.
