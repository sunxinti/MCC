**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content**: The research question seeks to determine whether the growth of uveal melanoma cells, which is dependent on the proto-oncogene c-kit, can be targeted therapeutically.
- **Key Information to Look For**:
  - Expression levels of c-kit in uveal melanoma cells.
  - Functional impact of c-kit on cell growth.
  - Effectiveness of inhibiting c-kit (e.g., using STI571) on cell viability.
  - Evidence supporting c-kit as a viable therapeutic target.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results and Data**:
  - **Expression of c-kit**: 84 out of 134 paraffin-embedded uveal melanoma samples and 6 out of 8 fresh-frozen samples expressed c-kit, indicating high prevalence.
  - **Functional Impact**: c-kit was strongly expressed and phosphorylated in uveal melanoma cells, suggesting active signaling.
  - **Inhibition Effects**: Treatment with STI571, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, blocked c-kit phosphorylation and induced cell death in uveal melanoma cell lines, with IC₅₀ values below 2.5 μM, demonstrating potency.
  - **Autocrine Stimulation**: Presence of c-kit ligand in all three cell lines points to autocrine or paracrine pathways sustaining c-kit activity.
- **Strength and Reliability**:
  - The study utilized both immunohistochemical analysis and Western blotting, providing robust methods for detecting c-kit expression and phosphorylation.
  - The use of multiple cell lines enhances the generalizability of the findings.
- **Relevance to the Question**:
  - The evidence directly addresses the role of c-kit in uveal melanoma growth and the potential of targeting it therapeutically.

**3. Conclusion**
The study provides strong scientific evidence that c-kit plays a significant role in the growth of uveal melanoma cells and that inhibiting c-kit with STI571 can effectively induce cell death. This supports the notion that c-kit is a promising therapeutic target for uveal melanoma.

**4. Final Answer**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether c-Kit-dependent growth of uveal melanoma cells is a potential therapeutic target, based on the study described. Key points to assess include:  
- Expression and activation of c-Kit in uveal melanoma.  
- Functional impact of c-Kit inhibition (e.g., via STI571) on cell survival/proliferation.  
- Whether the evidence supports c-Kit as a viable therapeutic target.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Expression and Activation**: The study demonstrates c-Kit expression in 63% (84/134) of uveal melanoma samples and strong phosphorylation (activation) in cultured cells, even in low-serum conditions. This contrasts with cutaneous melanoma, where c-Kit is less active.  
- **Autocrine/Paracrine Stimulation**: Detection of c-kit ligand (stem cell factor) in uveal melanoma cell lines suggests an autocrine/paracrine loop driving c-Kit activity.  
- **Functional Impact of Inhibition**: STI571 (a c-Kit tyrosine kinase inhibitor) induced cell death in uveal melanoma cell lines with an IC₅₀ < 2.5 μM, matching its inhibition of c-Kit phosphorylation and proliferation.  
- **Relevance**: The study directly links c-Kit signaling to growth and survival of uveal melanoma cells and demonstrates therapeutic efficacy of STI571 in vitro.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study provides robust evidence that c-Kit is actively involved in uveal melanoma growth and that its inhibition with STI571 is cytotoxic. The data strongly suggest c-Kit is a valid therapeutic target in this context, supporting a "yes" answer.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**
Qwen selected: yes

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether c-Kit-dependent growth in uveal melanoma cells represents a potential therapeutic target. Key information to evaluate includes:  
- Evidence of c-Kit expression and activity in uveal melanoma.  
- Functional impact of c-Kit inhibition (e.g., cell death or proliferation reduction).  
- Relevance of findings to therapeutic targeting (e.g., inhibitor efficacy like STI571).  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **c-Kit Expression**: 84/134 paraffin-embedded samples and 6/8 fresh-frozen uveal melanomas expressed c-Kit. Cell lines showed strong c-Kit phosphorylation, even under serum-depleted conditions.  
- **Mechanism**: Autocrine/paracrine stimulation via stem cell growth factor (c-Kit ligand) was detected, explaining activation without mutations (no exon 11 mutations found).  
- **Therapeutic Impact**: STI571 (c-Kit inhibitor) blocked phosphorylation and induced cell death in uveal melanoma cells. IC50 for both c-Kit inhibition and proliferation suppression was <2.5 µM, indicating potent and correlated effects.  
- **Reliability**: Data include multiple methodologies (IHC, Western blot, cell assays) and consistent results across samples and cell lines. However, the study is preclinical (in vitro and paraffin/frozen samples), lacking in vivo or clinical trial validation.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence strongly supports that c-Kit signaling is critical for uveal melanoma growth and is pharmacologically targetable with STI571. The direct correlation between c-Kit inhibition and cell death, coupled with mechanistic insights (ligand-driven activation), suggests therapeutic potential. While preclinical limitations exist, the abstract provides robust preliminary evidence for "yes."
