----- GPT's initial response -----
GPT is reasoning the answer...


**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content:** The question seeks to determine whether minimally invasive mitral valve repair using artificial chords (neochords) is both reproducible and suitable for routine surgical practice.
- **Key Information to Identify:** 
  - Repair success rate
  - Reproducibility of the technique
  - Applicability in a routine setting
  - Long-term stability and outcomes

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results and Data:** 
  - High repair rate of 99.8% with only one patient requiring valve replacement.
  - Low incidence of recurrent mitral regurgitation (3.5%) and no reoperations.
  - Stable outcomes over a follow-up period of 3-60 months with no failures of neochord implantation.
  - Procedure became the preferred technique in the study’s setting.
- **Strength and Reliability:** 
  - Large sample size of 426 patients enhances reliability.
  - Retrospective review provides substantial real-world evidence.
- **Relevance:** 
  - Directly addresses reproducibility and routine applicability through consistent high success rates and adoption as the preferred technique.

**3. Conclusion**
The study provides robust evidence supporting that minimally invasive mitral valve repair with artificial chords is both reproducible and applicable in routine surgical practice, evidenced by high success rates, stability of repairs, and its adoption as the preferred method.

**4. Final Answer:**
**My final choice is: "yes"**
GPT selected: yes

**1. Question Analysis**  
The core question asks whether minimally invasive mitral valve repair using artificial chords (neochords) is **reproducible** (consistent outcomes across cases) and **applicable in routine surgery** (feasible and effective as a standard practice). Key evidence to evaluate includes repair success rates, recurrence of mitral regurgitation, reoperation rates, procedural safety, and long-term stability of the repair.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Repair Success and Reproducibility**: The study reports a **99.8% repair rate** (425/426 patients) with **no reoperations** during follow-up. Only 3.5% had mild (Grade I) mitral regurgitation, and all others had none or trace regurgitation. No neochord de-insertion or rupture occurred, indicating technical stability.  
- **Routine Applicability**: The procedure was performed over 5 years in 426 consecutive patients, suggesting it is feasible in a routine setting. Patients were fast-tracked (25% extubated immediately, others within 6 hours), and 30-day mortality was low (1.2%).  
- **Long-Term Stability**: Follow-up (3–60 months) showed no deterioration in outcomes, reinforcing the reproducibility and durability of the technique.  
- **Study Limitations**: The study is retrospective, which may introduce selection bias. However, the large sample size and consistent results across years support its validity.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence strongly supports that minimally invasive mitral valve repair with artificial chords is both **reproducible** (consistent outcomes in 426 cases over 5 years) and **applicable in routine surgery** (used as the preferred technique with fast recovery and stable results). The absence of chord failure or reoperations further validates its reliability.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**
Qwen selected: yes

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether minimally invasive mitral valve repair (MVR) using artificial chords (neochords) is reproducible and applicable in routine surgery. Key elements to evaluate include procedural success rates, ease of implementation, and long-term stability of the technique.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Effectiveness**: The study reports a 99.8% repair rate (425/426 patients), with only 3.5% having mild residual regurgitation postoperatively. No reoperations or neochord failures occurred during follow-up (3–60 months).  
- **Reproducibility**: Neochords were used in all patients, including complex cases (e.g., combined with leaflet resection). The high repair rate and standardized approach suggest consistent application.  
- **Applicability**: The procedure was performed in a routine cardiac surgery setting, with fast-track recovery (25% extubated immediately). Low 30-day mortality (1.2%) and stable outcomes over follow-up support feasibility.  
- **Limitations**: Retrospective design and single-center data may limit generalizability, but the large cohort (n=426) and long follow-up strengthen reliability.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study demonstrates high procedural success, reproducibility across a large patient cohort, and durable outcomes without reoperations or neochord failure. The authors explicitly state this technique has become their routine approach. Evidence strongly supports "yes."  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: yes**
DeepSeek selected: yes

Initial consensus: All models selected yes
