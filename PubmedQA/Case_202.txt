Question: Diagnosis and follow-up in constipated children: should we use ultrasound?

**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content:** The research question seeks to determine whether ultrasound (US) should be utilized for diagnosing and monitoring constipation in children.
- **Key Information to Look For:** Efficacy of US in diagnosing megarectum and fecal load, reliability and reproducibility of US measurements, correlation of US findings with clinical outcomes, and whether US provides objective criteria that can guide treatment decisions.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results and Data:** The study involved 66 children, with 35 constipated and 31 controls. Ultrasound measurements showed that constipated children had significantly larger rectal diameters and greater fecal load compared to controls. A rectal diameter cutoff of 2.44 cm demonstrated good sensitivity (71%) and specificity (76%) for diagnosing constipation. Post-treatment follow-up showed a significant decrease in constipation scores and fecal load, although rectal diameter had not yet normalized.
- **Strength and Reliability:** The study reported high interobserver reliability (r = 0.981; P<.001), indicating that US measurements are consistent between different radiologists. The use of objective measurements and statistically significant findings (P<.001) strengthen the reliability of the evidence.
- **Relevance to the Question:** The evidence directly addresses the efficacy of US in both diagnosing and monitoring constipation in children, providing objective criteria that can aid in clinical decision-making and patient/family education.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the study's findings, ultrasound proves to be a valuable tool in diagnosing constipation in children by providing objective measurements that differentiate constipated patients from healthy controls. Additionally, it aids in monitoring treatment response, thereby supporting its use in both diagnosis and follow-up.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether ultrasound should be used for diagnosing megarectum, assessing fecal load, and monitoring treatment response in constipated children. Key information includes the study's comparison of constipated and control groups, measurement of rectal diameter and anterior wall thickness, and the follow-up results after treatment. The abstract emphasizes ultrasound's role in providing objective criteria for diagnosis and follow-up.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The study found statistically significant differences in rectal diameter between constipated (3.02 cm) and control (1.98 cm) groups (P<0.001), with a cutoff of 2.44 cm showing 71% sensitivity and 76% specificity. Interobserver reliability was strong (r=0.981), supporting reproducibility. Post-treatment, fecal load decreased significantly, but rectal diameter remained elevated (2.71 cm, P>.05), indicating persistent anatomical changes. The authors conclude that ultrasound provides objective criteria for diagnosis and follow-up, which can help persuade families to continue treatment. The sample size (n=66) is moderate, but results are statistically robust and directly address the question.

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence supports the use of ultrasound for diagnosis (via rectal diameter cutoff) and follow-up, as it provides objective measurements and correlates with treatment response. While rectal diameter did not fully normalize post-treatment, the ability to quantify changes supports its utility. Thus, the answer is "yes."

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether ultrasound (US) should be used for diagnosis and follow-up in constipated children. Key information to evaluate includes the study's findings on US efficacy in detecting megarectum/fecal load, its ability to monitor treatment response, and the objectivity/reproducibility of US measurements.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Diagnostic Utility**: The study found significantly larger post-void rectal diameters in constipated children (3.02 ± 1.04 cm vs. 1.98 ± 0.64 cm in controls; *P*<0.001), with a cutoff of 2.44 cm (71% sensitivity, 76% specificity). Increased fecal load and rectal wall thickness were also observed in constipated patients.  
- **Follow-up Utility**: Post-treatment, fecal load and constipation scores decreased significantly (*P*<0.001), though rectal diameters remained abnormal (2.71 ± 0.77 cm).  
- **Reliability**: High interobserver agreement (r=0.981, *P*<0.001) supports reproducibility.  
- **Limitations**: Moderate sensitivity/specificity of the cutoff and short follow-up (1 month) limit definitive conclusions about long-term normalization.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study demonstrates that US provides objective, reproducible measures (rectal diameter, fecal load) for diagnosing constipation and monitoring treatment response. While the cutoff has moderate accuracy, the authors emphasize its clinical utility for convincing families to continue treatment. However, incomplete normalization of rectal diameter post-treatment suggests longer follow-up may be needed. Overall, the evidence supports using US as a supplementary tool.
