**1. Question Analysis**
- The core question is whether difficulties in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) can predict the onset of dementia after 1 and 2 years.
- Key information to look for includes the association between IADL disabilities and the incidence of dementia at the specified follow-up periods, as well as the statistical significance and strength of this association.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- The study involved 531 participants at baseline, with follow-ups at 1 and 2 years.
- At 1-year follow-up, 13.0% developed dementia, and at 2-year follow-up, 20.8% did.
- Participants with IADL disabilities had a higher conversion rate to dementia (24.4%) compared to those without (16.7%), with a chi-square value of 4.28 and a p-value of .04, indicating statistical significance.
- Structural equation modeling showed that IADL disability had an odds ratio of 2.20 (95% CI: 1.51-3.13) at 1-year and 2.11 (95% CI: 1.33-3.33) at 2-year follow-up, suggesting a strong and reliable predictive relationship.

**3. Conclusion**
- The evidence from the study demonstrates a statistically significant and reliable association between IADL disabilities and the prediction of dementia at both 1- and 2-year follow-ups.
- The odds ratios indicate that individuals with IADL disabilities are more than twice as likely to develop dementia within these time frames compared to those without such disabilities.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) predict dementia diagnosis at 1- and 2-year follow-ups. Key information to verify includes:  
- Whether IADL disability is statistically associated with dementia conversion.  
- Whether this association remains significant after adjusting for confounders (age, education, cognitive tests, etc.).  
- Whether the study's design and results support a predictive role for IADL.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The study found:  
- A higher dementia conversion rate in participants with baseline IADL disabilities (24.4% vs. 16.7%, *p* = 0.04).  
- Structural equation modeling showed IADL disability independently predicted dementia at both follow-ups (OR = 2.20 [1.51–3.13] at 1 year and OR = 2.11 [1.33–3.33] at 2 years).  
- These odds ratios were statistically significant (confidence intervals exclude 1), and the analysis adjusted for clinical variables (e.g., Mini-Mental State Examination, verbal memory).  
- The prospective cohort design and large sample size (531 and 481 participants at 1- and 2-year follow-ups) strengthen the evidence.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The results clearly demonstrate that IADL disability is a statistically significant predictor of dementia conversion at both 1 and 2 years, even after accounting for conventional clinical measures. The abstract explicitly states that IADL is a "useful addition to the diagnostic process," confirming its predictive value.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether baseline instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) disabilities predict dementia diagnosis at 1- and 2-year follow-up. Key information to evaluate includes the study design, statistical associations (e.g., odds ratios), and the authors' conclusions regarding IADL's predictive value.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study is a multicenter prospective cohort with 531 participants at 1-year and 481 at 2-year follow-up.  
- Participants with baseline IADL disabilities had significantly higher dementia conversion rates (24.4% vs. 16.7%, *p* = 0.04).  
- Structural equation modeling (adjusted for age, sex, education, depression, and cognitive measures) showed IADL disability independently predicted dementia at both 1-year (OR = 2.20) and 2-year (OR = 2.11) follow-ups, with 95% CIs excluding 1.  
- The abstract explicitly concludes that IADL disability adds predictive value to conventional clinical measures.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence demonstrates a statistically significant, independent association between baseline IADL disabilities and increased dementia risk at 1- and 2-year follow-ups, supported by adjusted odds ratios and cohort data. The study design and results directly address the question, justifying a "yes" answer.
