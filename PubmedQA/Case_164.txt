**1. Question Analysis**

The core question seeks to determine whether CA72-4 is an effective biomarker for distinguishing between ovarian endometrioma (a benign condition) and epithelial ovarian cancer (a malignant condition). Key information to look for in the abstract includes:
- Comparison of CA72-4 levels in patients with ovarian endometrioma versus those with ovarian cancer.
- Statistical significance of the differences observed.
- The potential role of CA72-4 in clinical decision-making regarding diagnosis.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**

The abstract provides data from a study involving 72 patients with ovarian endometriomas and 55 patients with ovarian cancer. It reports that:
- CA125 levels were elevated in both ovarian endometriosis and ovarian cancer patients, making CA125 ineffective for differential diagnosis in this context.
- CA72-4 levels showed a marked difference between the two groups: 71.0% in ovarian cancer patients versus 13.8% in endometriosis patients, with a highly significant p-value (<0.0001).
- The study concludes that CA72-4 can be useful in confirming the benign nature of ovarian endometriomas when CA125 levels are elevated.

The evidence is based on a comparative analysis with statistically significant results, suggesting reliability. However, as this is a single study, further research would be beneficial to confirm these findings.

**3. Conclusion**

Based on the provided abstract, CA72-4 demonstrates a significant difference in levels between ovarian endometrioma and epithelial ovarian cancer patients, indicating its potential usefulness as a differential biomarker. The statistical significance supports its reliability, although additional studies would strengthen this conclusion.

**4. Final Answer**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether CA72-4 is a useful biomarker to differentiate ovarian endometrioma (benign) from epithelial ovarian cancer (malignant). Key information includes:  
- CA125 is not useful due to elevated levels in both conditions.  
- The study compared CA72-4 levels in 72 endometrioma patients and 55 ovarian cancer patients.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Results**: The study found a significant difference in CA72-4 positivity (71.0% in cancer vs. 13.8% in endometrioma; P<0.0001).  
- **Strength/Reliability**: The large difference in CA72-4 values and the strong statistical significance (P<0.0001) suggest robust evidence.  
- **Relevance**: The study directly addresses differential diagnosis by comparing the two conditions and highlights CA72-4’s ability to distinguish between them when CA125 is elevated.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The data strongly indicate that CA72-4 levels can help differentiate ovarian endometrioma from epithelial ovarian cancer, especially in cases with elevated CA125. The marked difference in CA72-4 values supports its utility as a supplementary biomarker.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**
Qwen selected: yes

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether CA72-4 is a useful biomarker for distinguishing ovarian endometrioma (a benign condition) from epithelial ovarian cancer. Key information to evaluate includes the comparative performance of CA72-4 versus CA125 in these groups and the statistical significance of observed differences.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study compared serum CA72-4 and CA125 levels in 72 ovarian endometrioma patients and 55 ovarian cancer patients.  
- CA125 was elevated in both groups, confirming its poor diagnostic specificity.  
- CA72-4 showed a marked difference: 71.0% of ovarian cancer patients had elevated levels, versus only 13.8% of endometrioma patients (*P*<0.0001), indicating high specificity for malignancy.  
- The statistical significance (*P*<0.0001) supports the robustness of the observed difference.  
- The abstract concludes that CA72-4 can help confirm the benign nature of ovarian endometriomas when CA125 is elevated.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence strongly supports CA72-4 as a discriminative biomarker in this context, given its significant differential expression and specificity for ovarian cancer. While further validation is warranted, the study’s findings directly address the clinical need highlighted in the question.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: yes**
DeepSeek selected: yes

Initial consensus: All models selected yes
