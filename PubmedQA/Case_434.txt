**1. Question Analysis**

- **Core Content**: The primary question investigates whether the temperature during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) has an impact on the development of postoperative euthyroid sick syndrome.
- **Key Information to Identify**: 
  - Comparison between hypothermic and normothermic CPB.
  - Changes in thyroid function parameters (TT4, TT3, free T3, rT3, TSH) across different temperatures.
  - Incidence and persistence of euthyroid sick syndrome post-CPB.
  - Study outcomes related to patient recovery and complications.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**

- **Research Results and Data**:
  - Both hypothermic (cold) and normothermic (warm) CPB groups exhibited reductions in TT4 and TT3 below baseline values starting with CPB and lasting up to 5 days post-CPB.
  - Free T3 was reduced for up to 3 days post-CPB in both groups.
  - Mean serum rT3 was elevated on postoperative days 1 and 3 in both groups.
  - TSH levels remained unchanged in both groups.
  - Clinical outcomes such as postoperative myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and death were similar between the two temperature groups.
  - Most patients in both groups had normal postoperative recoveries despite changes in thyroid function.

- **Strength and Reliability of Evidence**:
  - The study is prospective and controlled, enhancing the reliability of the findings.
  - However, the sample size is small (12 patients), which may limit the generalizability of the results.
  
- **Relevance to the Question**:
  - The evidence directly addresses the impact of CPB temperature on thyroid function changes indicative of euthyroid sick syndrome.
  - Since both temperature groups showed similar thyroid function alterations and clinical outcomes, the temperature during CPB did not differentially affect the development of euthyroid sick syndrome.

**3. Conclusion**

Based on the study's findings, temperature during cardiopulmonary bypass (whether hypothermic or normothermic) does not influence the development of postoperative euthyroid sick syndrome. Both temperature modalities resulted in similar thyroid function alterations and clinical outcomes, supporting the notion that CPB temperature does not affect this specific postoperative condition.

**4. Final Answer:**
**My final choice is: "yes"**
GPT selected: yes

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether the temperature during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) affects the development of postoperative euthyroid sick syndrome. The key is to determine if hypothermic (cold) vs. normothermic (warm) CPB leads to differences in thyroid function changes (euthyroid sick syndrome). The study compared these two groups, measuring thyroid hormones (TT4, TT3, fT3, rT3, TSH) at multiple timepoints.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The study found that **both groups (normothermic and hypothermic CPB)** exhibited similar thyroid function changes:  
- TT4 and TT3 decreased post-CPB and persisted for up to 5 days.  
- fT3 decreased for up to 3 days.  
- rT3 increased on postoperative days 1 and 3.  
- TSH remained unchanged.  
The abstract explicitly states: *"Normothermic CPB does not prevent the development of the 'euthyroid sick syndrome' during and after CPB."* This directly indicates that temperature during CPB does not influence the syndrome’s occurrence. The sample size is small (n=6 per group), but the results are consistent between groups, and the conclusion is明确.

**3. Conclusion**  
Since the study found no difference in euthyroid sick syndrome development between hypothermic and normothermic CPB, the temperature during CPB does **not** affect this outcome. The abstract’s conclusion aligns with the question’s assertion, supporting a "yes" answer.

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether the temperature during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) affects the development of postoperative euthyroid sick syndrome (ESS). Key information to evaluate includes whether hypothermic vs. normothermic CPB leads to differences in thyroid function markers (TT4, TT3, fT3, rT3, TSH) and clinical outcomes related to ESS.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study compared 12 patients undergoing hypothermic (26°C) vs. normothermic (35°C) CPB. Both groups showed identical patterns of thyroid dysfunction: reduced TT4, TT3, and fT3, elevated rT3, and unchanged TSH, consistent with ESS.  
- No statistical differences were observed between the two groups in thyroid hormone levels or clinical outcomes (e.g., myocardial infarction, mortality).  
- The small sample size (n=6 per group) limits statistical power, but the consistency of results across groups strengthens the conclusion. The authors explicitly state that normothermic CPB does not prevent ESS.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence supports that CPB temperature does not influence the occurrence of ESS, as both groups exhibited identical thyroid hormone changes and clinical outcomes. Despite the small sample, the direct comparison and consistent findings justify a "yes" answer.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: yes**
DeepSeek selected: yes

Initial consensus: All models selected yes
