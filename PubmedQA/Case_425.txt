Question: Have antiepileptic drug prescription claims changed following the FDA suicidality warning?

**1. Question Analysis**
- The core question investigates whether the prescription claims for antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have changed following the FDA's suicidality warning issued in May 2009.
- Key information involves examining trends in AED prescriptions before, during, and after the FDA warning period to determine if there was a significant impact on prescription behaviors.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Study Design:** The research employed a longitudinal interrupted time-series design, which is robust for assessing interventions over time.
- **Data Source:** Oklahoma Medicaid claims data from January 2006 to December 2009 were analyzed, covering periods before, during, and after the FDA warning.
- **Sample Size:** The study included 9,289 continuously eligible members with diagnoses of epilepsy and/or psychiatric disorders who had at least one AED prescription claim, providing a substantial dataset.
- **Findings:**
  - **Before Warning:** A significant upward trend in AED prescriptions was observed.
  - **During Warning:** No significant change in the trend was detected.
  - **After Warning:** Similarly, no significant change in the trend was observed.
  - **Stratification:** No diagnostic group (epilepsy alone, epilepsy with comorbid psychiatric disorder, psychiatric disorder alone) showed a significant change in trends.
- **Strength and Reliability:** The large sample size and longitudinal design enhance the reliability of the findings. The lack of significant changes across different periods and diagnostic groups directly addresses the research question.
- **Relevance:** The evidence is highly relevant as it directly evaluates the impact of the FDA warning on AED prescription claims.

**3. Conclusion**
- Based on the evidence provided, the FDA suicidality warning does not appear to have significantly affected AED prescription claims among the study population.

**4. Final Answer**
**My final choice is: "no"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether antiepileptic drug (AED) prescription claims changed after the FDA issued its suicidality warning in 2008 and 2009. Key information to assess includes the study design, time periods analyzed, and the statistical significance of changes in prescription trends before, during, and after the warning.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Results**:  
  - Before the FDA warning (2006–2008), AED prescriptions showed a **significant upward trend** (0.01% per month).  
  - During the warning period (2008–2009), there was no significant change in trend (-20%, 99% CI: -70% to 30%, *p*=0.34).  
  - After the warning (2009), the estimated trend increased by 80% (99% CI: -20% to 200%, *p*=0.03), but this was **not significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons** (stratified analysis showed no significant changes in any diagnostic group).  
- **Strength/Reliability**:  
  - The study uses a longitudinal interrupted time-series design with Medicaid claims data, which is robust for evaluating policy impacts.  
  - The confidence intervals for both the "during" and "after" periods are wide and include zero, indicating imprecision.  
  - The conclusion explicitly states that the FDA warning "does not appear to have significantly affected prescription claims."  
- **Relevance**: The study directly addresses the question by evaluating prescription trends across the specified time periods and stratifying by diagnosis.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence shows no statistically significant change in AED prescription trends following the FDA warning, even when accounting for diagnostic subgroups. While point estimates for post-warning trends (e.g., +80%) might suggest an effect, the wide confidence intervals and lack of significance after adjustment weaken this interpretation. The study’s conclusion aligns with the data, indicating no meaningful impact.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "no"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether AED prescription claims changed after the FDA's 2008–2009 suicidality warnings. Key elements include evaluating trends in AED prescriptions before, during, and after the warnings, focusing on statistical significance and stratified diagnostic groups (epilepsy, psychiatric disorders).

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study analyzed Oklahoma Medicaid claims (2006–2009) using a longitudinal interrupted time-series design.  
- Pre-warning (2006–2008) showed a significant upward trend in AED prescriptions (0.01% monthly increase).  
- During and after the FDA warnings, no statistically significant changes in prescription trends were detected compared to the pre-warning period:  
  - During-warning trend: -20.0% change (99% CI: -70.0% to 30.0%, p=0.34).  
  - Post-warning trend: 80.0% change (99% CI: -20.0% to 200.0%, p=0.03 [not significant at 99% CI]).  
- Stratification by diagnostic groups (epilepsy alone, epilepsy with psychiatric disorders, psychiatric disorders alone) also revealed no significant changes (p>0.01).  
- The abstract explicitly concludes that the FDA warnings did not significantly affect AED prescription claims.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence demonstrates no statistically significant association between the FDA warnings and AED prescription trends, even after stratification. The confidence intervals during and post-warning periods include the null effect, and p-values do not meet the study's strict significance threshold (α=0.01). Thus, the answer is **"no"**.

**My final choice is: no**
