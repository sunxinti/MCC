Question: Do adjuvant aromatase inhibitors increase the cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer?

**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content:** The question seeks to determine whether adjuvant aromatase inhibitors (AIs) elevate the cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal women undergoing treatment for early breast cancer.
- **Key Information to Identify:** Comparative cardiovascular event rates between AIs and tamoxifen, statistical significance of the findings, magnitude of risk difference, and relevance to the specified patient population.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results:** The meta-analysis encompassed 7 randomized clinical trials with a total of 19,818 patients. It found that AIs were associated with a higher incidence of grade 3 and 4 cardiovascular adverse events (CVAEs) compared to tamoxifen (Relative Risk [RR] = 1.31; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.07-1.60; P= .007). Specifically, for third-generation AIs, the increased risk remained significant (RR = 1.34; 95% CI: 1.09-1.63; P= .0038).
- **Strength and Reliability:** The evidence is robust, given the large sample size and the use of multiple randomized controlled trials. The statistical significance indicates a reliable association.
- **Relevance:** The findings are directly applicable to postmenopausal women with early breast cancer, as they specifically address the cardiovascular risks associated with adjuvant AI therapy in this population.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the meta-analysis, there is a statistically significant increase in the risk of severe cardiovascular events for postmenopausal women with early breast cancer treated with adjuvant aromatase inhibitors compared to those treated with tamoxifen. Although the absolute risk increase is relatively low, the evidence supports a real association between AI use and elevated cardiovascular risk.

**4. Final Answer**
**My final choice is: "yes"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether adjuvant aromatase inhibitors (AIs) increase cardiovascular risk compared to tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer. Key information to evaluate includes the reported cardiovascular event rates, statistical significance, and absolute risk differences between the two treatment groups in the meta-analysis.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The meta-analysis of seven RCTs (n=19,818) found a statistically significant increased risk of grade 3/4 cardiovascular events (CVAE) with AIs versus tamoxifen (RR 1.31; 95% CI 1.07–1.60; P=0.007).  
- The absolute difference (AD) in event rates was 0.52%, translating to an NNH of 189 (i.e., 189 patients treated with AIs instead of tamoxifen to cause 1 additional CVAE).  
- Even when restricted to third-generation AIs, the risk remained significant (RR 1.34; 95% CI 1.09–1.63; P=0.0038).  
- While thromboembolic events favored AIs (lower risk), the question focuses on cardiovascular events broadly, which showed a significant increase with AIs.  

The evidence is strong,来自多个大型RCT的meta分析，具有统计学意义，且结果一致（即使排除其他因素后仍显著）。  

**3. Conclusion**  
The data clearly show a statistically significant increase in grade 3/4 cardiovascular events with AIs compared to tamoxifen. Although the absolute risk increase is low (0.52%), the question only asks whether AIs increase the risk, not whether the risk is clinically substantial. The answer is therefore "yes."

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether adjuvant aromatase inhibitors (AIs) increase cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer. Key information to evaluate includes:  
- Comparative cardiovascular event (CVAE) rates between AIs and tamoxifen.  
- Statistical significance of differences (risk ratios, confidence intervals, p-values).  
- Absolute risk differences and clinical relevance (e.g., number needed to harm, NNH).  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Meta-analysis results**: Seven RCTs (19,818 patients) showed a statistically significant increase in grade 3/4 CVAEs with AIs vs. tamoxifen (RR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.07–1.60; *P* = 0.007).  
- **Absolute difference**: 0.52% higher CVAE risk with AIs (NNH = 189), persisting for third-generation AIs (RR = 1.34, *P* = 0.0038; absolute difference = 0.57%).  
- **Strength of evidence**: Rigorous methodology (phase 3 RCTs, meta-analysis), consistent findings across trials (no significant heterogeneity), and statistical significance.  
- **Limitations**: Absolute risk increase is small, and the clinical significance of this difference depends on context (e.g., baseline cardiovascular risk).  

**3. Conclusion**  
The meta-analysis provides robust evidence that AIs increase the relative risk of severe cardiovascular events compared to tamoxifen, with statistical significance. While the absolute risk difference is modest, the question specifically asks about increased risk, which the data confirm.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: yes**
