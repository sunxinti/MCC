Question: Continuity of care experience of residents in an academic vascular department: are trainees learning complete surgical care?

**1. Question Analysis**

The core question examines whether the continuity of care experience provided to residents in an academic vascular department ensures that trainees are learning complete surgical care, encompassing preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative phases. Key information to seek includes the extent of resident involvement in each phase of patient care, the consistency of this involvement across different case types, and any identified factors that may impede comprehensive training.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**

The study presented in the abstract reveals that the continuity of care experiences for vascular surgery trainees is suboptimal. Specifically:

- **Preoperative Assessment:** Residents were involved in 67% of cases.
- **Decision to Operate:** Involvement was limited to 17% of cases.
- **Postoperative Assessment on the Ward:** Involvement was relatively higher at 79%.
- **Patient Follow-up in Clinic:** Very low involvement at 3%.
- **Complete In-Hospital Continuity of Care:** Achieved in only 57% of cases.

The study also highlights that same-day admission surgeries, which constituted the majority of cases, were associated with the poorest continuity of care. Emergent and previously admitted elective cases showed higher rates of resident involvement in preoperative assessments and decision-making processes.

The data is derived from a prospective cohort study with a sample size of 159 cases, and the findings are statistically significant (P<.05) in relevant comparisons. This suggests reliability in the evidence provided.

**3. Conclusion**

The evidence indicates that the current training structure does not consistently provide residents with comprehensive continuity of care experiences across all phases of surgical care. Especially concerning is the minimal involvement in preoperative decision-making and postoperative follow-up, which are crucial for complete surgical training.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether vascular surgery trainees are learning complete surgical care, defined as involvement in preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative phases. Key data points to assess include residents' participation in preoperative decisions, postoperative care, follow-up, and factors affecting continuity (e.g., case type).  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Preoperative involvement**: Only 67% of residents assessed patients preoperatively, and just 17% were involved in the decision to operate.  
- **Postoperative involvement**: 79% participated in postoperative ward care, but only 3% followed patients in clinic.  
- **Complete in-hospital continuity** (pre-op and post-op): 57%, but same-day admission cases (65% of total) had the poorest continuity (e.g., 58% pre-op assessment vs. 78% for pre-admitted elective cases).  
- **Study conclusion**: The abstract explicitly states that continuity of care experiences for trainees are "suboptimal," particularly in postoperative clinic follow-up. Same-day surgeries, which dominate caseloads, exacerbate this issue.  

The data directly address the question and are internally consistent. The low follow-up rates and lack of involvement in key decisions indicate gaps in training for complete surgical care.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence shows that residents frequently miss critical aspects of continuity (e.g., decision-making, follow-up), with only a minority achieving complete in-hospital continuity. The study’s authors conclude that current training is inadequate, especially in ambulatory and postoperative phases. Thus, trainees are **not** consistently learning complete surgical care as defined.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether vascular surgery trainees in an academic department are learning "complete surgical care" through continuity of care (preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative involvement). Key information to evaluate includes rates of resident participation in preoperative decision-making, postoperative assessments, and follow-up clinic evaluations, as well as factors influencing these rates (e.g., case type).

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Preoperative Involvement**: Residents performed preoperative assessments in 67% of cases but were involved in the decision to operate in only 17%. Emergent cases had higher preoperative assessment rates (92%) compared to elective cases (63%).  
- **Postoperative Involvement**: Postoperative ward assessments occurred in 79% of cases, but follow-up clinic assessments were strikingly low (3%).  
- **Continuity**: Only 57% of cases involved both preoperative and postoperative in-hospital assessments. Same-day admission cases (65% of total) had the poorest continuity.  
- **Study Conclusion**: The authors explicitly state that continuity of care is "suboptimal," particularly for postoperative clinic follow-up, and emphasize the need for structural changes in training.  

The data are derived from a prospective cohort study with statistical analysis (chi² test), indicating reliable methodology. The low clinic follow-up (3%) and minimal involvement in preoperative decision-making (17%) directly address the question’s focus on "complete surgical care."  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence demonstrates significant gaps in trainees' continuity of care, particularly in preoperative decision-making and postoperative clinic follow-up. The study concludes that current training does not adequately provide complete surgical care experiences. Thus, the answer is **"no."**
