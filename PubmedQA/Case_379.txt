Question: Are octogenarians at high risk for carotid endarterectomy?

----- GPT's initial response -----

**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content:** The primary question seeks to determine whether individuals in their eighties (octogenarians) are at a high risk for undergoing carotid endarterectomy, a surgical procedure to prevent stroke.
- **Key Information to Look For:**
  - Perioperative morbidity and mortality rates in octogenarians undergoing the procedure.
  - Comparison of these rates to established safety and efficacy benchmarks.
  - Conclusions drawn by the study regarding age as a risk factor.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results and Data:** 
  - **Sample Size:** 103 carotid endarterectomies in 95 octogenarians.
  - **Demographics:** 59 men and 36 women, with a mix of symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid stenosis.
  - **Risk Factors:** Included diabetes (17%), hypertension (76%), coronary artery disease (28%), hyperlipidemia (39%), and smoking history (42%).
  - **Complications:** 4 perioperative neurologic complications (approximately 3.88%) with no deaths reported.
- **Strength and Reliability:** 
  - The study spans a 12-year period, indicating a substantial timeframe for data collection.
  - The absence of mortality and low complication rates suggest reliability in the findings.
- **Relevance to the Question:** 
  - Directly addresses the safety and risk associated with carotid endarterectomy in individuals aged 80-89.
  - Provides empirical evidence contradicting the notion that octogenarians are inherently high-risk candidates.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the data, octogenarians undergoing carotid endarterectomy experienced low perioperative morbidity and no mortality, indicating that age alone does not constitute a high-risk factor for the procedure. Therefore, octogenarians should not be automatically categorized as high-risk solely based on their age.

**4. Final Answer**
**My final choice is: "no"**
GPT selected: no

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether octogenarians (aged 80–89) are at high risk for carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Key information to evaluate includes perioperative morbidity, mortality, and the study’s conclusions regarding age as a risk factor.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Complications**: The study reports 4 perioperative neurologic complications (1 TIA, 2 minor strokes, 1 major stroke) in 103 CEAs (combined rate ≈ 3.9%), with **no deaths**.  
- **Study Conclusion**: The abstract explicitly states that "age alone should not place patients in the high-risk category for carotid endarterectomy" and that CEA remains the gold standard for all age groups.  
- **Relevance**: The data directly address the question by demonstrating acceptable perioperative outcomes in octogenarians, challenging the assumption that age alone constitutes high risk.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study’s results show low perioperative mortality (0%) and morbidity (≈4% neurologic events), with the authors concluding that age alone should not categorize octogenarians as high risk. This strongly supports a "no" answer.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "no"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether octogenarians (aged 80–89) are at high risk for carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Key information to evaluate includes perioperative morbidity/mortality rates (e.g., strokes, myocardial infarctions, death) in this age group compared to established benchmarks for "high risk."

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study included 103 CEAs in 95 octogenarians. Perioperative complications included 1 transient ischemic attack (0.97%), 2 minor strokes (1.94%), 1 major stroke (0.97%), and no deaths. Total adverse neurologic events: **3.88%** (4/103).  
- No myocardial infarctions or deaths were reported.  
- The authors conclude that combined adverse event rates are "acceptable" and explicitly state that age alone should not classify octogenarians as high-risk for CEA.  
- The study’s sample size (103 procedures) and 12-year duration lend moderate reliability, but generalizability depends on comparison to broader data. Typical high-risk thresholds for CEA complications (e.g., >3% for asymptomatic patients, >6% for symptomatic) suggest these rates are within acceptable limits.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The data shows low perioperative morbidity/mortality in octogenarians, and the authors directly reject age as a sole high-risk criterion. Thus, octogenarians are not inherently at high risk for CEA based on this evidence.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: no**
