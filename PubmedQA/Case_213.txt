Question: Are acceptance rates of a national preventive home visit programme for older people socially imbalanced?

**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content:** The primary question seeks to determine if the acceptance rates of a national preventive home visit programme for older individuals are socially imbalanced, specifically in relation to socioeconomic status.
- **Key Information:** The study examines the association between socioeconomic status (measured by financial assets) and the acceptance of preventive home visits. Additionally, it evaluates whether the methods used by municipalities to invite participants influence this association.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results:** The study found that older individuals with higher financial assets were more likely to accept preventive home visits (adjusted OR = 1.5). However, when invitational procedures were taken into account, this association weakened. Specifically, individuals with lower financial assets were more likely to accept visits if invited by a letter with a proposed date compared to those with higher assets invited through other methods.
- **Strength and Reliability:** The study utilized logistic regression analyses with a sizable sample of 1,023 participants, enhancing the reliability of the findings. The confidence intervals provided (CI95%: 1.1-2.0) indicate a statistically significant association.
- **Relevance:** The evidence directly addresses the research question by highlighting the link between socioeconomic status and acceptance rates, as well as the impact of invitational procedures.

**3. Conclusion**
The findings suggest that there is a social imbalance in the acceptance rates of the preventive home visit programme, with individuals of higher socioeconomic status being more likely to accept. However, this imbalance can be mitigated by altering invitational procedures, indicating that the social inequality is not solely inherent but can be influenced by how the programme is offered.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether acceptance rates of a preventive home visit program for older adults in Denmark are socially imbalanced (i.e., associated with socioeconomic status). Key information to evaluate includes:  
- Whether socioeconomic status (SES) correlates with acceptance rates.  
- Whether invitational procedures modify this association.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The study found:  
- **Higher SES (measured by financial assets)** was associated with **higher acceptance rates** (adjusted OR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.1–2.0).  
- This association **weakened** when invitational procedures were accounted for.  
- Proactive invitational procedures (e.g., letters with proposed dates) increased acceptance among **lower SES individuals**, narrowing the gap but with wide confidence intervals.  

The evidence is reliable as it uses logistic regression adjusted for gender and objective data (financial assets from national registries). However, the modified association after adjusting for invitational procedures suggests that current procedures may partially mitigate SES disparities, but the baseline association (without procedure adjustment) clearly shows social imbalance.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study confirms that higher SES individuals initially accept the program more often, indicating a social imbalance. However, proactive invitational procedures can reduce this disparity. Since the question asks whether acceptance rates are *currently* socially imbalanced, the answer is **yes**, as the raw association exists. The "maybe" qualifier would apply only if procedures fully eliminated disparities, which they do not (the OR remains >1 even after adjustment).

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether acceptance rates of a preventive home visit program for older people in Denmark are socially imbalanced, specifically tied to socioeconomic status (SES). Key information includes:  
- Association between SES (measured by financial assets) and acceptance rates.  
- Role of invitational procedures in modifying this association.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study found a statistically significant association: individuals with high financial assets had higher acceptance rates (adjusted OR = 1.5, CI 1.1–2.0).  
- This association weakened when adjusted for invitational procedures, suggesting procedural differences (e.g., proactive invitations like letters with proposed dates) attenuated social disparities.  
- Proactive invitations increased acceptance among low-SES individuals, though confidence intervals for subgroup analyses were wide, indicating some uncertainty.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence confirms that high SES correlates with higher acceptance rates, indicating social imbalance. However, invitational procedures reduced this disparity. Since the core question focuses on whether such imbalance exists (not its modifiability), the answer is "yes," as socioeconomic status initially predicted acceptance rates.
