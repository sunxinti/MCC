**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content:** The question seeks to determine whether early discharge from the hospital, accompanied by nurse home visits, has an impact on the adequacy of newborn metabolic screening.
- **Key Information to Look For:** Comparative data on the adequacy of metabolic screening between early discharge infants and those with traditional hospital stays, including rates of screening, adequacy of initial specimens, and timeliness of obtaining adequate specimens.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results:** 
  - **Screening Rates:** 99.2% of early discharge infants were screened compared to 96.0% of traditional stay infants.
  - **Initial Specimen Adequacy:** 22.9% of early discharge infants had inadequate initial specimens versus 14.3% in the traditional group.
  - **Repeat Specimens:** Early discharge infants had a higher rate of repeat specimens (85.0%) compared to traditional stay infants (75.3%).
  - **Timeliness:** 98.8% of early discharge infants had an adequate specimen within the first 9 days of life, compared to 96.7% of traditional stay infants.
- **Strength and Reliability:** The study includes a substantial sample size (3860 infants) and shows statistically significant differences (P-values <.05) in key outcomes.
- **Relevance:** The data directly addresses the impact of early discharge on the adequacy of metabolic screening, indicating that while there are differences in initial adequacy and repeat testing rates, the overall adequacy within a specific timeframe is maintained or improved.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the evidence, early discharge with nurse home visits does not compromise the overall adequacy of newborn metabolic screening. While there are higher rates of initial specimen inadequacy, the higher rates of repeat testing and timely adequacy mitigate potential negative effects, leading to overall comparable or improved screening outcomes.

**4. Final Answer**
**My final choice is: "no"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether early discharge (24–47 hours) combined with nurse home visits impacts the adequacy of newborn metabolic screening (e.g., PKU, hypothyroidism, CAH). Key points to evaluate include:  
- Comparison of screening rates and specimen adequacy between early discharge and traditional stay groups.  
- Whether early discharge leads to compromised screening outcomes.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The study compared 1,324 early discharge infants and 2,536 traditional stay infants. Key findings:  
- **Screening rate**: 99.2% of early discharge infants vs. 96.0% of traditional infants had at least one test (p<0.0001).  
- **Initial specimen adequacy**: Early discharge infants had higher rates of inadequate first specimens (22.9% vs. 14.3%, p<0.0001).  
- **Repeat testing**: Early discharge infants were more likely to have a repeat test if the first was inadequate (85.0% vs. 75.3%, p=0.002).  
- **Final adequacy by day 9**: 98.8% of early discharge infants vs. 96.7% of traditional infants had an adequate specimen (p=0.0005).  

The study concludes that early discharge with nurse home visits does **not** compromise metabolic screening adequacy. The higher initial inadequacy in early discharge infants was offset by better repeat testing rates, leading to comparable or even superior final adequacy (98.8% vs. 96.7%).  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence shows that while early discharge infants had more initial inadequate specimens, the overall adequacy of screening by day 9 was higher in the early discharge group. The study explicitly states that metabolic screening is "not compromised" in their program with nurse home visits. Thus, the answer is **no**.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The core question asks whether early discharge with nurse home visits impacts the adequacy of newborn metabolic screening. Key elements to evaluate include:  
- Rates of initial inadequate specimens  
- Follow-up rates for repeat testing  
- Overall adequacy of screening within a critical timeframe (e.g., first 9 days of life).  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The study compared early discharge (24–47 hours) and traditional stay infants:  
- **Initial inadequacy**: Early discharge infants had higher rates of inadequate initial specimens (22.9% vs. 14.3%, *P*<.0001).  
- **Follow-up**: Early discharge infants had better repeat testing rates (85.0% vs. 75.3%, *P*=0.002).  
- **Final adequacy**: By day 9, 98.8% of early discharge vs. 96.7% of traditional stay infants had adequate specimens (*P*=0.0005).  

The abstract concludes that metabolic screening is "not compromised" by early discharge in this program. The evidence is statistically robust (large sample, significant *P*-values) and directly addresses adequacy through repeat testing and timeliness.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The answer is **"no"** because, despite higher initial inadequacy, the structured follow-up (enabled by nurse home visits) ensured comparable or superior overall adequacy compared to traditional care. The program’s design mitigated risks associated with early discharge, aligning with the conclusion that screening adequacy was maintained.
