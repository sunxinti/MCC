Question: The use of audit to identify maternal mortality in different settings: is it just a difference between the rich and the poor?

**1. Question Analysis**
- The core question examines whether the use of audits to identify maternal mortality in various settings is solely influenced by economic disparities between rich and poor regions.
- Key information to look for includes whether factors other than economic status contribute to differences in maternal mortality, as identified through audits in diverse settings.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- The research compares maternal mortality across high-income (Netherlands) and low-income countries (Zambia, The Gambia, Namibia).
- Findings reveal varied causes of maternal deaths: HIV/AIDS in Namibia, sepsis and HIV/AIDS in Zambia, (pre-)eclampsia in the Netherlands, and obstructed labor in The Gambia.
- The study concludes that differences in maternal mortality are influenced by factors beyond just economic status, emphasizing the importance of audits to identify specific local causes and solutions.
- The evidence is robust as it encompasses multiple regions with differing income levels and identifies distinct causes of mortality in each, highlighting the multifaceted nature of the issue.

**3. Conclusion**
- The evidence demonstrates that while economic factors are significant, they are not the sole determinants of maternal mortality differences between settings.
- Audits reveal a range of causes specific to each region, indicating that other factors such as healthcare infrastructure, prevalent diseases, and local conditions also play crucial roles.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether differences in maternal mortality identified through audit are merely a reflection of wealth disparities (rich vs. poor countries). Key points to assess:  
- Whether the study's data supports that differences in maternal mortality causes/factors are *only* due to income level.  
- Whether the abstract explicitly addresses whether other factors beyond wealth contribute to these differences.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The abstract states:  
- Maternal mortality ratios (MMR) vary widely (10 vs. 1540 per 100,000 in the Netherlands vs. The Gambia).  
- **Causes of death differ by setting**: HIV/AIDS in Namibia, sepsis/HIV in Zambia, pre-eclampsia in the Netherlands, and obstructed labor in The Gambia.  
- The conclusion explicitly states: *"Differences in maternal mortality are more than just differences between the rich and poor."*  
- The study emphasizes that solutions must be tailored to local audit findings, as causes and contributing factors are context-specific.  

This evidence directly refutes the idea that differences are *only* due to wealth. The study highlights distinct causes (e.g., HIV, pre-eclampsia, obstructed labor) and structural/local factors beyond income, such as healthcare infrastructure and political will.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The abstract explicitly states that differences in maternal mortality are **not merely** about wealth ("more than just differences between the rich and poor"). The data on causes (e.g., HIV in Namibia vs. pre-eclampsia in the Netherlands) and the call for locally tailored solutions further support this. Thus, the answer is **"no"**.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether maternal mortality audit differences across settings are solely due to economic disparities ("rich vs. poor"). Key points to evaluate include whether the study identifies factors beyond wealth (e.g., specific causes of death, local healthcare challenges) and if audits reveal context-specific contributors to maternal mortality.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The abstract highlights varying maternal mortality ratios (MMRs) across low- and high-income countries (10–1540 per 100,000) and distinct causes of death: HIV/AIDS in Namibia, sepsis/HIV in Zambia, (pre-)eclampsia in the Netherlands, and obstructed labor in The Gambia. These differences reflect local epidemiological and healthcare challenges (e.g., HIV prevalence, access to emergency obstetric care) rather than purely economic gaps. The authors explicitly state that maternal mortality differences are "more than just differences between the rich and poor," emphasizing the role of audits in identifying context-specific solutions.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence supports that audits uncover diverse, setting-specific causes and contributing factors (e.g., disease burden, clinical care gaps) beyond wealth disparities. Thus, the answer is **"no"**—differences in maternal mortality identified through audits are not merely economic but involve contextual and systemic factors.

**My final choice is: "no"**
