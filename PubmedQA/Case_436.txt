**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content:** The question seeks to determine whether septoplasty, a surgical procedure to correct a deviated nasal septum, affects the dimensions of compensatory hypertrophy in the middle turbinate, which is an enlargement that can occur to compensate for septal deviation.
- **Key Information to Look For:** The abstract should provide data comparing the dimensions of the middle turbinate before and after septoplasty, statistical significance of any changes, and the overall conclusion regarding the impact of septoplasty on compensatory hypertrophy.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results and Data:** The study measured both mucosal and bony structures of the middle turbinate on concave and convex sides of the septum before and at least one year after septoplasty. The results indicated that there were no significant changes in the dimensions of these structures post-surgery. Additionally, a significant negative correlation was found between the septum angle and the middle turbinate area on the deviated side after septoplasty (p = 0.033).
- **Strength and Reliability:** The use of paired sample t-tests and Wilcoxon rank sum tests suggests appropriate statistical methods were employed. The follow-up period of at least one year provides a reasonable timeframe to assess long-term changes.
- **Relevance to the Question:** The evidence directly addresses whether septoplasty affects the compensatory hypertrophy of the middle turbinate by providing comparative measurements before and after the procedure.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the study's findings, septoplasty does not significantly alter the dimensions of compensatory hypertrophy in the middle turbinate. The lack of significant changes in both mucosal and bony components supports the conclusion that septoplasty does not impact the hypertrophic state of the middle turbinate over the long term.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether septoplasty alters the dimensions of compensatory hypertrophy of the middle turbinate. Key points to assess in the abstract include:  
- Pre- and post-septoplasty measurements of the middle turbinate's bony and mucosal structures.  
- Statistical significance of changes (e.g., paired t-test, Wilcoxon rank sum test).  
- The study's explicit conclusion regarding whether septoplasty affects compensatory hypertrophy.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The study explicitly states:  
- "The dimensions of bony and mucosal components of the middle turbinate on concave and convex sides of the septum were **not significantly changed** by septoplasty."  
- The abstract's conclusion directly asserts, "compensatory hypertrophy of the middle turbinate is **not affected by septoplasty**, even after one year."  
The statistical tests (paired t-test, Wilcoxon) confirmed no significant changes in dimensions. While a correlation between septal angle and turbinate area was noted, this does not indicate a change in hypertrophy dimensions caused by surgery. The evidence is strong and directly addresses the question.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study provides clear evidence that septoplasty does **not** alter the dimensions of compensatory hypertrophy of the middle turbinate. The results and conclusion align, and the methodology (radiological measurements, statistical analysis) supports this finding.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "no"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether septoplasty alters the dimensions of compensatory hypertrophy of the middle turbinate. The key focus is on comparing pre- and post-septoplasty measurements of middle turbinate bony and mucosal components, particularly on the concave and convex sides of the deviated septum.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study measured middle turbinate dimensions radiologically before and â‰¥1 year post-septoplasty.  
- Paired statistical tests (t-test, Wilcoxon) showed **no significant changes** in bony/mucosal dimensions on either side after septoplasty.  
- A significant negative correlation between septal angle and turbinate area on the deviated side post-surgery was noted, but this does not directly indicate dimensional changes in hypertrophy.  
- The abstract explicitly concludes that compensatory hypertrophy is **not affected** by septoplasty, even long-term.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence strongly supports that septoplasty does not alter compensatory hypertrophy dimensions of the middle turbinate, as no significant changes were found in key measurements. The conclusion is consistent with the statistical results.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: no**
