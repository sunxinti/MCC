**1. Question Analysis**
The core question is whether technical factors in hepatic arterial embolization influence the prognosis of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). Key information includes understanding what specific technical factors (e.g., selective embolization) are evaluated and how they relate to patient survival outcomes.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
The study retrospectively analyzed 815 patients with HCC who underwent hepatic arterial embolization. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted. The findings indicate that selective embolization significantly improves overall survival, as evidenced by a hazard ratio of 0.68 (95% CI 0.48-0.97; p = 0.033) in the multivariate Cox model. The large sample size and data from 43 centers enhance the reliability and generalizability of the results. Thus, the evidence strongly supports that specific technical factors, particularly selective embolization, positively impact prognosis.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the study's robust methodology and significant findings, it is clear that certain technical factors in hepatic arterial embolization, such as selective embolization, affect the prognosis of patients with unresectable HCC.

**4. Final Answer**
**My final choice is: "yes"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether technical factors of hepatic arterial embolization influence the prognosis of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Key factors to evaluate include procedural techniques (e.g., selective embolization, use of iodized oil) mentioned in the abstract.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The abstract reports a retrospective study of 815 patients. Univariate analysis identified several prognostic factors, including "selective embolization." Critically, multivariate Cox regression confirmed that selective embolization remained an independent predictor of better survival (HR 0.68; 95% CI 0.48–0.97; p=0.033). This suggests that the technical factor "selective embolization" significantly improves survival, even after adjusting for other variables. The study’s large sample size (815 patients) and multivariate analysis strengthen the evidence’s reliability.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study explicitly links selective embolization—a technical factor—to improved survival in HCC patients. Since this factor is both statistically and clinically significant (HR <1 and p<0.05), the answer is affirmative.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether technical factors (e.g., embolization technique, materials) in hepatic arterial embolization (HAE) affect prognosis in unresectable HCC patients. The key information to identify includes study findings on technical factors (e.g., selective vs. non-selective embolization, iodized oil use) and their statistical association with survival outcomes.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study analyzed 815 HCC patients undergoing HAE.  
- **Univariate analysis** identified selective embolization and iodized oil use as significant positive prognostic factors.  
- **Multivariate analysis** confirmed selective embolization as an independent predictor of improved survival (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.48–0.97, *p*=0.033), indicating a 32% reduction in mortality risk.  
- The abstract explicitly concludes that selective embolization improves survival.  
- Other technical factors (e.g., iodized oil) showed significance in univariate analysis but were not retained in the final multivariate model.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study provides statistically robust evidence (multivariate-adjusted HR) that selective embolization—a technical factor—positively impacts prognosis. While other technical factors (e.g., iodized oil) showed univariate associations, only selective embolization remained significant after adjusting for confounders. Thus, the answer is **"yes"** based on the demonstrated survival benefit of selective embolization.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: yes**
DeepSeek selected: yes

Initial consensus: All models selected yes
