Question: Do women residents delay childbearing due to perceived career threats?

GPT is reasoning the answer...


**1. Question Analysis**
The core question is whether women medical residents delay childbearing due to perceived threats to their careers. Key information to identify includes gender differences in childbearing plans during residency, perceived career threats influencing these plans, and the extent to which these perceptions mediate the decision to delay childbearing.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
The study surveyed 424 residents with a 77% response rate. It found that a significantly lower percentage of women (27%) planned to have children during residency compared to men (41%, P = .01). Women scored higher on perceived career threats related to childbearing, and after adjusting for various factors, women were less likely to plan to have children (odds ratio 0.46). Mediation analysis revealed that perceived career threats accounted for 67% of the gender difference in childbearing plans. The study's methodology appears robust, with a reliable instrument (Cronbach alpha of 0.84) and relevant statistical analyses supporting the findings.

**3. Conclusion**
The evidence strongly supports that women residents delay childbearing due to perceived career threats.

**4. Final Answer**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether women residents delay childbearing due to perceived career threats. The key information to identify in the abstract includes:  
- Gender differences in plans to have children during residency.  
- Whether perceived career threats (measured in the study) explain these differences.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The study found:  
- **27% of women vs. 41% of men** planned to have children during residency (statistically significant, *P* = 0.01).  
- Women reported **higher perceived career threat scores** (mean 2.9 vs. 2.1 for men, *P* = 0.001) across all four threat dimensions (e.g., extended training, career interference).  
- After adjusting for confounders, women were **64% less likely** (OR = 0.46, 95% CI 0.25–0.84) to plan pregnancy during residency.  
- Mediation analysis showed that perceived career threats **explained 67% of the gender gap** in childbearing intentions.  

The study used a validated instrument (Cronbach’s α = 0.84), a reasonable sample size (77% response rate), and controlled for potential confounders. The results directly link perceived career threats to women’s decisions to delay childbearing.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence strongly supports that perceived career threats are a significant reason women residents delay childbearing. The mediation analysis quantifies this effect (67% of the gender difference explained), and the statistical significance of the findings adds reliability.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether women residents delay childbearing due to perceived career threats. Key information to identify includes:  
- Gender differences in plans to have children during residency  
- Perceived career threats as a mediating factor  
- Statistical evidence linking these perceptions to delayed childbearing  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Study Results**:  
  - 41% of men vs. 27% of women planned to have children during residency (*P = .01*).  
  - Women scored significantly higher on perceived career threats (mean 2.9 vs. 2.1 for men, *P = .001*), with the scale showing strong reliability (Cronbach alpha = 0.84).  
  - After adjusting for confounders, women were less likely to plan pregnancy (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.25–0.84).  
  - Mediation analysis attributed 67% of the gender variance to career threats.  

- **Strength and Relevance**:  
  - The study design (multi-institutional survey with high response rate) and validated scale support reliability.  
  - The direct link between career threat perceptions and delayed childbearing is statistically significant and quantitatively explained (67% mediation).  

**3. Conclusion**  
The abstract provides robust evidence that women residents perceive career threats as a major barrier to childbearing during residency, with mediation analysis confirming these perceptions explain most of the gender disparity. The findings directly align with the question.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: yes**
DeepSeek selected: yes

Initial consensus: All models selected yes
