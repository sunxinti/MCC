Question: Is laparoscopic reoperation for failed antireflux surgery feasible?

----- GPT's initial response -----
GPT is reasoning the answer...


**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content:** The primary question seeks to determine whether laparoscopic reoperation is a feasible approach for patients who have experienced a failure in their initial antireflux surgery.
- **Key Information to Look For:** Success rates of laparoscopic reoperations, complication rates, conversion rates to open surgery, mortality rates, patient satisfaction, and overall outcomes that indicate the practicality and safety of the procedure.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results:**
  - **Sample Size:** The study involved 46 patients undergoing laparoscopic reoperation.
  - **Safety:** There was a 0% mortality rate. Operative complications included fundus tears (8), significant bleeding (4), bougie perforation (1), small bowel enterotomy (1), and tension pneumothorax (1).
  - **Conversion Rate:** Overall conversion rate was 20%, but notably reduced to 0% in the last 10 patients, indicating a possible improvement with experience.
  - **Hospital Stay:** The mean hospital stay was relatively short at 2.3 days for operations completed laparoscopically.
  - **Patient Satisfaction:** High satisfaction was reported, with 89% of patients satisfied with their decision to undergo reoperation.
  - **Outcomes:** Significant improvement in well-being scores from 8.6 before surgery to 2.9 after surgery (P<.001).
- **Strength and Reliability:** The study is a case series from two academic medical centers, which provides practical insights but may have limitations in generalizability due to the sample size and study design.
- **Relevance:** The evidence directly addresses the feasibility of laparoscopic reoperations, considering multiple factors such as safety, effectiveness, and patient satisfaction.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the evidence presented, laparoscopic reoperation for failed antireflux surgery appears to be feasible. The procedure demonstrated acceptable complication rates, no mortality, high patient satisfaction, and improved clinical outcomes. Additionally, the reduction in conversion rates over time suggests that with increased experience, the feasibility and success of the procedure may further improve.

**4. Final Answer:**
**My final choice is: "yes"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether laparoscopic reoperation is feasible for patients with failed antireflux surgery. Key information to evaluate includes the success rate, complications, conversion rates to open surgery, patient outcomes, and the study's conclusions.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Results**: The study reports that laparoscopic reoperations were performed in 46 patients, with a 20% conversion rate to open surgery (though 0% conversion in the last 10 cases). Mortality was 0%, and postoperative complications (e.g., fundus tears, bleeding) were managed.  
- **Outcomes**: Follow-up showed significant improvement in well-being scores (from 8.6 to 2.9 on a 10-point scale) and high patient satisfaction (89% satisfied).  
- **Strengths**: The abstract highlights technical feasibility despite challenges, with improved outcomes and low mortality. The decreasing conversion rate over time suggests operator learning and improved techniques.  
- **Limitations**: The study is a retrospective case series with potential selection bias and lacks a control group.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence supports feasibility: the procedures were performed laparoscopically in most cases, complications were manageable, and patient outcomes were favorable. The authors explicitly state that "the laparoscopic approach may be used successfully," aligning with the positive results.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether laparoscopic reoperation for failed antireflux surgery is feasible. Key elements to evaluate include success rates, complications, conversion rates to open procedures, patient outcomes, and the authors' conclusion about feasibility.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Technical Success**: The study reports 46 patients undergoing laparoscopic reoperations with a 0% mortality rate. The conversion rate to open surgery was 20% overall but dropped to 0% in the last 10 patients, suggesting improved technique over time.  
- **Outcomes**: Postoperative satisfaction was high (89% of 35 followed patients), with significant improvement in well-being scores (from 8.6 to 2.9, *P*<0.001).  
- **Complications**: Operative complications (e.g., fundus tear, bleeding) occurred but were manageable without mortality.  
- **Authorsâ€™ Conclusion**: The abstract explicitly states that the laparoscopic approach "may be used successfully" despite technical challenges, aligning with the data.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence supports feasibility: successful outcomes, high satisfaction, manageable complications, and decreasing conversion rates indicate laparoscopic reoperation is viable. Limitations (e.g., retrospective design, small sample) do not negate the demonstrated technical feasibility.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: yes**
DeepSeek selected: yes

Initial consensus: All models selected yes
