Question: Is plate clearing a risk factor for obesity?

----- GPT's initial response -----
GPT is reasoning the answer...


**1. Question Analysis**
- The core question is whether plate clearing behavior serves as a risk factor for obesity.
- Key information to look for includes any association between plate clearing tendencies and measures of obesity, such as BMI, as well as the strength and significance of this relationship as reported in the abstract.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- The study involved 993 US adults and examined the relationship between habitual plate clearing and BMI.
- Results showed a positive association between plate clearing tendencies and BMI (β=0.18, 95% CIs=0.07, 0.29, P<0.001), indicating statistical significance.
- The association remained significant even after controlling for various demographic and behavioral factors known to influence BMI.
- The abstract concludes that plate clearing may constitute a risk factor for weight gain, based on the observed association.

**3. Conclusion**
- The evidence from the study demonstrates a significant positive association between plate clearing behaviors and higher BMI, suggesting that plate clearing is linked to increased body weight.
- Given the statistical significance and the robustness of the association after adjusting for other factors, it is reasonable to consider plate clearing as a risk factor for obesity.

**4. Final Answer:**
**My final choice is: "yes"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether plate clearing is a risk factor for obesity. Key information to identify from the abstract includes: (1) whether plate clearing is associated with increased body weight or obesity, (2) the direction and statistical significance of this association, and (3) whether confounding variables were accounted for in the analysis.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The abstract reports a positive association between plate clearing and BMI in a cohort of 993 US adults. After adjusting for demographic and behavioral predictors of BMI, the analysis showed a statistically significant increase in BMI (β=0.18, 95% CI=0.07–0.29, *P*<0.001) linked to plate clearing. This indicates that higher tendencies to clear plates were consistently associated with higher body weight. The study controlled for multiple confounders, strengthening the evidence for a direct association. While the abstract does not explicitly mention "obesity" (e.g., BMI ≥30), it directly ties plate clearing to increased BMI, a well-established marker of obesity risk. The study’s conclusion also states that plate clearing "may constitute a risk factor for weight gain," aligning with the question’s premise.

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence shows a statistically significant and independent association between plate clearing and higher BMI. Since BMI is a standard measure for obesity classification, this supports the conclusion that plate clearing is a risk factor for obesity. The study’s design and results do not suggest ambiguity or lack of evidence, so "maybe" is unwarranted.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether plate clearing (habitually eating all food on one’s plate) is a risk factor for obesity. The key information to identify in the abstract includes:  
- Whether plate clearing is statistically associated with higher BMI/body weight.  
- Whether this association persists after controlling for confounding variables.  
- The study’s conclusion regarding causality or risk.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study (n=993 US adults) found a **positive association** between plate clearing tendencies and BMI (β=0.18, *P*<0.001), even after adjusting for demographic/behavioral confounders.  
- The abstract explicitly states that plate clearing "may constitute a risk factor for weight gain," indicating a causal implication.  
- Strengths: Large sample size, adjustment for multiple covariates, statistically significant results.  
- Limitations: Observational design (cannot prove causation), self-reported plate-clearing behavior (potential bias).  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence supports a **positive association** between plate clearing and higher BMI, with the authors concluding it "may" be a risk factor. While causation is not definitively proven, the study’s rigor and explicit conclusion align with a "yes" answer based on the provided data.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: yes**
DeepSeek selected: yes

Initial consensus: All models selected yes
