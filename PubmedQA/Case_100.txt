**1. Question Analysis**
- The core question seeks to determine whether the type of remission (partial vs. complete) following a major depressive episode serves as a significant risk factor for relapse over a 4-year period.
- Key information to look for includes relapse rates associated with different types of remission and the strength of remission type as a predictive factor for relapse.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- The study followed 139 Spanish outpatients diagnosed with a unipolar major depressive episode over more than 4 years.
- Relapse rates were significantly higher in the partial remission group (91.4%) compared to the complete remission group (51.3%).
- The type of remission ("partial vs. complete") was identified as the most powerful predictive factor for relapse, along with other factors like symptom intensity, age, and number of previous depressive episodes.
- The study utilized robust methodologies including Structured Clinical Interviews and survival analysis, enhancing the reliability of the evidence.

**3. Conclusion**
- The evidence clearly indicates that the type of remission after a major depressive episode is a strong and significant predictor of relapse within a 4-year follow-up period.
- Given the substantial difference in relapse rates between partial and complete remission groups, the type of remission is indeed an important risk factor.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether the type of remission (complete vs. partial) after a major depressive episode is an important risk factor for relapse over 4 years. Key information to identify in the abstract includes:  
- Comparison of relapse rates between remission types.  
- Whether the study identifies remission type as a predictive factor for relapse.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The abstract states:  
- **Partial remission group had a 91.4% relapse rate**, compared to **51.3% in the complete remission group**.  
- "Partial remission versus complete remission" was identified as **the most powerful predictive factor** for relapse, along with other factors like symptom intensity, age, and prior episodes.  
- The study used survival analysis and proportional hazards models, which are robust methods for assessing predictive factors.  

The evidence is strong and directly addresses the question. While limitations like decreasing sample size and treatment compliance are noted, the conclusion explicitly states that partial remission is an important predictor.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study provides clear, statistically significant data showing that partial remission is strongly associated with higher relapse rates. Since the abstract explicitly names remission type as the **most powerful predictive factor**, the answer is supported by the evidence.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**
Qwen selected: yes

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether the type of remission (partial vs. complete) after a major depressive episode (MDE) is a significant risk factor for relapses during a 4-year follow-up. Key information to evaluate includes relapse rates in partial vs. complete remission groups and predictive factors identified in the study.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study followed 139 outpatients with MDE for over 4 years, categorizing remission using Frank criteria and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale.  
- Relapse rates were substantially higher in the partial remission group (91.4%) compared to the complete remission group (51.3%).  
- Partial remission was identified as the strongest predictive factor for relapse, alongside symptom intensity, age, and prior depressive episodes.  
- The abstract explicitly states that "partial remission after a depressive episode seems to be an important predictive factor for relapses," aligning with the study’s conclusion.  
- Limitations include potential attrition bias (decreasing sample size) and treatment compliance issues, but these do not negate the primary finding’s statistical significance.

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence strongly supports that partial remission significantly increases relapse risk compared to complete remission. The study directly links remission type to relapse outcomes, making the answer "yes."

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: yes**
DeepSeek selected: yes

Initial consensus: All models selected yes
