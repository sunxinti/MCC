Question: Do nomograms designed to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) do a better job of predicting more clinically relevant prostate cancer outcomes than BCR?

----- GPT's initial response -----
GPT is reasoning the answer...


**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content:** The question seeks to determine whether nomograms created to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) are more effective at predicting more clinically significant outcomes, specifically prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM), compared to their ability to predict BCR itself.
- **Key Information:** The abstract indicates that the nomograms not only predict aggressive BCR and PCSM effectively but also do so with higher accuracy (higher c-index values) for PCSM than for BCR.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results:** The study analyzed four postoperative nomograms and found that all could predict aggressive BCR and PCSM significantly. Importantly, the nomograms had higher predictive accuracy for PCSM than for BCR, as evidenced by higher c-index values.
- **Strength and Reliability:** The study included a substantial sample size of 1,778 men from the SEARCH database, spanning nearly two decades, which adds robustness to the findings. The use of Cox analyses and c-index values provides a strong methodological approach to assess predictive accuracy.
- **Relevance:** The evidence directly addresses the research question by comparing the predictive capabilities of the nomograms for both BCR and PCSM, demonstrating superior performance for the more clinically relevant outcome (PCSM).

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the abstract, the nomograms not only predict BCR but do so with greater accuracy for PCSM, a more clinically relevant outcome. The evidence is strong and directly relevant to the question posed.

**4. Final Answer:**
**My final choice is: "yes"**
GPT selected: yes

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether nomograms designed to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) are better at predicting more clinically relevant outcomes (e.g., prostate cancer-specific mortality [PCSM]) than they are at predicting BCR itself. Key information to identify in the abstract includes:  
- Whether the nomograms predict PCSM and other clinically relevant outcomes.  
- Comparison of their predictive accuracy for PCSM versus BCR.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The study analyzed four nomograms (DPC, Kattan, JHH, CPDR/CaPSURE) in 1,778 men who underwent radical prostatectomy. Results showed:  
- All nomograms significantly predicted PCSM and aggressive BCR (PSADT <9 months).  
- The **c-index values** (measures of predictive accuracy) for PCSM were **higher** than those for BCR across all nomograms, indicating better accuracy for PCSM.  
- The abstract explicitly states: *"they predicted PCSM more accurately than they predicted BCR (ie, with higher c-index values)"* and *"nomograms... predict PCSM and other more clinically relevant endpoints... with generally greater accuracy than BCR."*  

The evidence is strong, as the study used a large, long-term dataset and validated multiple established nomograms. The statistical comparison of c-indices directly addresses the question.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study provides clear evidence that nomograms predict PCSM (a clinically relevant outcome) with greater accuracy than BCR. The higher c-index values for PCSM confirm this. Thus, the answer is **"yes"**.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**
Qwen selected: yes

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether nomograms designed to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) outperform BCR in predicting more clinically relevant prostate cancer outcomes (e.g., prostate cancer-specific mortality [PCSM]). Key information to identify includes whether the nomogramsâ€™ predictive accuracy for PCSM or other definitive endpoints is superior to their accuracy for BCR, as measured by statistical metrics like c-index values.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study tested four nomograms (DPC, Kattan, JHH, CPDR/CaPSURE) using Cox analyses and c-index comparisons in 1778 men post-radical prostatectomy.  
- Results showed all nomograms predicted **aggressive BCR (PSADT <9 months)** and **PCSM** significantly.  
- Critically, the c-index values for predicting **PCSM** were **higher** than those for predicting **BCR**, indicating superior accuracy for PCSM.  
- The abstract explicitly states that nomograms predict PCSM "more accurately than they predicted BCR," confirming their better performance for clinically definitive endpoints.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence supports that nomograms designed for BCR prediction are indeed more accurate for PCSM (a clinically relevant outcome) than for BCR itself. The higher c-index values for PCSM validate this conclusion.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: yes**
DeepSeek selected: yes

Initial consensus: All models selected yes
