**1. Question Analysis**
The core research question is whether local anesthesia is necessary to reduce patient pain during intra-articular contrast medium administration for magnetic resonance arthrography (MRa) of the shoulder. Key information to look for includes the comparison of pain levels between patients who received local anesthesia and those who did not, statistical significance of any differences observed, and any potential implications on patient comfort and procedural costs or risks.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
The study involved 249 outpatients who underwent MRa of the shoulder, divided into three groups: one receiving local anesthesia (group A) and two control groups not receiving anesthesia (groups B and C). Pain levels were measured using a visual analog scale (VAS). The results showed mean pain levels of 2.6 ± 2.3 for group A, 2.6 ± 2.2 for group B, and 2.7 ± 2.4 for group C. Statistical analysis revealed no significant difference in pain intensity among the three groups (p=.960). Additionally, while there was a significant difference in pain perception between men and women (p=.009), this difference was consistent across all groups (p=.934), indicating that the use of local anesthesia did not differentially affect pain perception based on sex. The study appears to be well-conducted with a reasonable sample size and appropriate statistical analysis, enhancing the reliability of the findings.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the evidence presented, the use of local anesthesia does not significantly reduce pain during intra-articular contrast medium administration for shoulder MRa. Therefore, local anesthesia may not be necessary for this procedure, potentially leading to reduced costs and lower risk of adverse reactions without compromising patient comfort.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The core question is whether local anesthesia is necessary to reduce pain during intra-articular contrast medium injection for shoulder MR arthrography. Key information to identify includes:  
- Comparison of pain levels with vs. without local anesthesia.  
- Statistical significance of pain differences between groups.  
- Study design, sample size, and methodology.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Results**: The study compared three groups: Group A (local anesthesia) had a mean pain VAS of 2.6 ± 2.3, while Groups B and C (no anesthesia) had 2.6 ± 2.2 and 2.7 ± 2.4, respectively. The p-value for group differences was **0.960**, indicating **no statistically significant difference in pain intensity** between groups.  
- **Strength/Reliability**: This was a prospective, randomized study with a large sample size (249 patients), proper controls, and validated pain assessment (VAS). The high p-value strongly supports the lack of effect.  
- **Relevance**: The study directly addresses the question by comparing pain outcomes with and without local anesthesia during the same procedure (MR arthrography of the shoulder).  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study provides robust evidence that local anesthesia does not reduce pain during shoulder MR arthrography, as pain levels were statistically indistinguishable between groups. The authors’ conclusion aligns with the data, suggesting local anesthesia is unnecessary.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether local anesthesia is necessary prior to intraarticular contrast administration for MR arthrography of the shoulder. Key information to evaluate includes pain intensity comparisons between groups with and without local anesthesia, statistical significance of results, and study design validity.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Results**: Pain levels (VAS scores) were nearly identical across groups:  
  - Group A (local anesthesia): 2.6 ± 2.3  
  - Groups B/C (no anesthesia): 2.6 ± 2.2 and 2.7 ± 2.4.  
  - No statistically significant difference (p=0.960).  
- **Study Design**: Randomized, controlled, with 249 patients. Exclusion criteria minimized confounding factors (prior surgery, repeated MRa).  
- **Sex Differences**: Pain perception differed between sexes (p=0.009), but this did not interact with anesthesia use (p=0.934), strengthening the conclusion that anesthesia itself had no effect.  
- **Conclusion**: The abstract explicitly states local anesthesia is unnecessary, as it does not reduce pain.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study provides strong evidence that local anesthesia does not reduce pain during MR arthrography of the shoulder. The lack of statistical significance (p=0.960) and consistent results across groups support the conclusion. The randomized design and adequate sample size enhance reliability.
