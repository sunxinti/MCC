**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content:** The question seeks to determine whether long-term continuation of folic acid (FA) supplements is necessary for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients who are on a stable regimen of methotrexate and daily FA.
- **Key Information to Extract:** 
  - Impact of discontinuing FA on methotrexate toxicity and efficacy.
  - Incidence of adverse effects (like neutropenia, nausea) when FA is stopped.
  - Any changes in the efficacy of methotrexate when FA is discontinued.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results:**
  - Stopping FA led to a higher discontinuation rate due to adverse effects (21% vs. 46% in placebo).
  - Increased incidence of nausea in the placebo group (45% vs. 7%).
  - Placebo group experienced some reduction in disease activity, though not clinically significant.
  - Instances of neutropenia were observed only in the placebo group.
- **Strength and Reliability:**
  - The study was prospective, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled, enhancing its reliability.
  - Sample size was 75 patients, which is modest but adequate for preliminary conclusions.
- **Relevance:**
  - Directly addresses the necessity of continuing FA in the specified patient population on methotrexate.

**3. Conclusion**
The evidence strongly suggests that continuing FA supplementation in RA patients on methotrexate reduces the likelihood of adverse effects leading to discontinuation of therapy and lowers the risk of neutropenia without significantly compromising the efficacy of methotrexate.

**4. Final Answer:**
**My final choice is: "yes"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on methotrexate and folic acid (5 mg daily) should continue folic acid long term. Key points to assess:  
- Does stopping folic acid increase methotrexate toxicity (e.g., hematologic or liver toxicity, nausea)?  
- Does stopping folic acid reduce methotrexate efficacy?  
- The study’s results on discontinuation rates, toxicity, and efficacy are critical.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The study was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 75 RA patients on methotrexate (<20 mg/week) and folic acid 5 mg daily. Patients were randomized to continue folic acid or switch to placebo. Key findings:  
- **Toxicity**:  
  - Placebo group had higher early discontinuation (46% vs. 21% in folic acid group, *P* = 0.02).  
  - Two placebo-group patients discontinued due to neutropenia.  
  - Nausea was significantly more frequent in the placebo group (45% vs. 7%, *P* = 0.001).  
- **Efficacy**:  
  - Placebo group showed slightly lower disease activity on some variables, but this was deemed clinically insignificant.  
- **Conclusion from the abstract**: Folic acid prevents treatment discontinuation due to toxicity (e.g., nausea, neutropenia) without meaningful loss of methotrexate efficacy.  

The study’s design (randomized, controlled) and statistical significance (*P* values) support the reliability of these results. The primary limitation is the 33% overall dropout rate, but this itself highlights folic acid’s role in tolerability.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence strongly suggests that continuing folic acid reduces adverse effects (neutropenia, nausea) and prevents early treatment discontinuation, without compromising methotrexate efficacy. The study’s results align with the abstract’s conclusion, making a “yes” the most supported answer.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients on methotrexate and daily folic acid (FA) 5 mg require long-term FA supplementation to prevent toxicity and maintain methotrexate efficacy. Key elements include assessing evidence for FA's role in reducing methotrexate toxicity (e.g., nausea, neutropenia) and whether stopping FA compromises treatment safety or efficacy.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study compared continuing FA (5 mg/day) vs. placebo in 75 RA patients on methotrexate.  
- **Toxicity**: Placebo group had higher discontinuation rates (46% vs. 21%, *P=0.02*), including neutropenia cases. Nausea incidence was significantly higher in placebo at 9 months (45% vs. 7%, *P=0.001*).  
- **Efficacy**: Placebo group showed slightly lower disease activity in some measures, but the difference was deemed clinically insignificant.  
- The authors conclude that FA prevents treatment discontinuation due to toxicity (mouth ulcers, nausea, neutropenia) with minimal impact on methotrexate efficacy.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study provides strong evidence (via a rigorous design) that discontinuing FA increases toxicity-related dropout and adverse effects (e.g., nausea, neutropenia) without clinically meaningful efficacy loss. Thus, long-term FA supplementation is warranted to mitigate toxicity.
