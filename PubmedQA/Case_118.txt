**1. Question Analysis**

- **Core Content**: The research question seeks to determine whether the level of experience of pediatric housestaff (interns vs. residents) affects the number and types of tests ordered for infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).
  
- **Key Information to Look For**:
  - Comparison between different experience levels of housestaff (interns vs. residents).
  - Specific tests analyzed (arterial blood gases, radiographs, electrolytes).
  - Outcomes indicating a difference in test ordering based on experience.
  - Statistical significance of any observed differences.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**

- **Research Results and Data**:
  - Interns ordered a significantly higher number of arterial blood gases per infant compared to residents (3.22 vs. 2.89 per night, p = .02).
  - No significant differences were found between interns and residents in ordering radiographs or electrolytes.
  
- **Strength and Reliability**:
  - The study was a prospective cohort study with a substantial sample size (785 infants) over an academic year.
  - Multiple linear regression was used to control for confounding variables, enhancing the reliability of the findings.
  
- **Relevance to the Question**:
  - The evidence directly addresses the influence of housestaff experience on test ordering, at least for arterial blood gases.
  - While the study focused primarily on arterial blood gases, the methodology supports the applicability of the findings to the broader question of test ordering behavior.

**3. Conclusion**

Based on the evidence, there is a demonstrated influence of housestaff experience on the ordering of arterial blood gases in the NICU. While no differences were observed for other tests like radiographs and electrolytes, the presence of a significant difference in at least one test suggests that experience does influence test ordering practices.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether the experience level of pediatric housestaff (e.g., interns vs. residents) influences the number of tests ordered for infants in the neonatal ICU. Key variables to assess include the comparison between interns and residents, the types of tests examined (arterial blood gases, radiographs, electrolytes), and whether statistical controls for confounding factors (e.g., illness severity, workload) were applied.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The study found that **interns ordered significantly more arterial blood gases per infant than residents (p = 0.02)**, with a difference of 0.33 blood gases per infant per night. This difference was statistically significant and translated to increased costs. However, no significant differences were observed in radiographs or electrolytes. The analysis controlled for severity of illness, workload, and supervision, strengthening the validity of the findings. The limitation is that the effect was specific to one test (arterial blood gases), not all tests.  

**3. Conclusion**  
Since the study demonstrates a statistically significant association between housestaff experience (interns vs. residents) and the ordering of **arterial blood gases**, the answer is "yes." The effect is specific to one test, but the question does not restrict the analysis to all tests. The controlled variables and prospective design enhance the reliability of the evidence.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether pediatric housestaff experience (interns vs. residents) influences the number of tests ordered for infants in the neonatal ICU. Key elements to evaluate include differences in test ordering (arterial blood gases, radiographs, electrolytes) between interns and residents, while accounting for confounding factors like infant severity-of-illness, workload, and supervision.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The study found that interns ordered **significantly more arterial blood gases** per infant than residents (3.22 vs. 2.89, p = 0.02), even after controlling for severity-of-illness, workload, and supervision. No differences were observed for radiographs or electrolytes. The results directly link less experienced housestaff (interns) to increased ordering of one specific test type. However, the effect was not universal across all tests, and the study explicitly states that broader outcomes (e.g., morbidity/mortality) were not assessed.

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence supports a "yes" answer because the study demonstrates that housestaff experience (interns vs. residents) significantly influences the ordering of arterial blood gases, a specific test category. While other tests showed no difference, the question broadly asks about "tests ordered," and the study confirms an association for at least one critical test. The statistical significance and adjustment for confounders strengthen the reliability of this finding.

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: yes**
DeepSeek selected: yes

Initial consensus: All models selected yes
