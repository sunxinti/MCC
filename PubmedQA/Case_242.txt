**1. Question Analysis**

The core question investigates whether trabecular bone is associated with the primary stability of miniscrews. Key information to examine includes the relationship between trabecular bone properties (such as trabecular thickness, number, separation, bone volume density, and bone mineral density) and measures of primary stability (insertion torque, implant mobility, and pull-out strength).

**2. Evidence Evaluation**

The study compared the primary stability of miniscrews inserted into bone blocks with varying bone mineral densities and the presence or absence of cortical bone. The findings indicate that lower bone mineral density in trabecular bone correlates with reduced primary stability. Additionally, there are significant correlations between trabecular properties (e.g., number, thickness, bone volume density) and stability measures (insertion torque, implant mobility, pull-out strength). The use of statistical tests (P≤.05) supports the reliability of these associations. The abstract succinctly states that cancellous (trabecular) bone plays an important role in the primary stability of mini-implants, regardless of cortical bone presence.

**3. Conclusion**

The evidence strongly suggests that trabecular bone characteristics are significantly related to the primary stability of miniscrews. The study's results demonstrate clear correlations between trabecular bone properties and stability measures, indicating a meaningful relationship.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether trabecular bone is related to the primary stability of miniscrews. Key information to assess includes:  
- Whether trabecular bone properties (e.g., trabecular thickness, BMD) correlate with primary stability metrics (insertion torque, mobility, pull-out strength).  
- The study’s conclusion about the role of cancellous (trabecular) bone in primary stability.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The abstract states:  
- Lower trabecular BMD and absence of cortical bone were associated with reduced primary stability (P ≤ 0.05).  
- Trabecular properties (trabecular number, thickness, BV/TV, trabecular BMD, total BMD) showed significant positive correlations with insertion torque, mobility, and pull-out strength (P ≤ 0.05).  
- The conclusion explicitly states that cancellous bone plays an important role in primary stability, even in the absence of cortical bone.  

The evidence is strong, as statistical correlations (Pearson test) and direct comparisons between groups with varying trabecular properties are reported. The study’s design (controlled bone blocks, measured outcomes) supports the reliability of these findings.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The abstract provides clear evidence that trabecular bone properties (e.g., BMD, trabecular thickness, BV/TV) are statistically correlated with primary stability metrics. The conclusion directly affirms the role of trabecular bone. Thus, the answer is "yes."

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether trabecular bone is related to the primary stability of miniscrews. Key information to evaluate includes:  
- The role of trabecular bone properties (e.g., thickness, number, BMD) in primary stability metrics (insertion torque, mobility, pull-out strength).  
- Whether correlations between trabecular parameters and stability outcomes are demonstrated.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study found significant correlations (P≤0.05) between trabecular bone properties (trabecular number, thickness, BV/TV, BMD) and primary stability measures (IT, PTV, PS).  
- Lower trabecular BMD and absence of cortical bone reduced primary stability, but trabecular metrics independently correlated with stability even in the absence of cortical bone.  
- The abstract explicitly states that "cancellous [trabecular] bone plays an important role in primary stability," confirming its relevance.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence strongly supports a relationship between trabecular bone properties and primary stability, as trabecular parameters directly correlated with stability outcomes. The study’s findings and statistical significance justify a definitive answer.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**
