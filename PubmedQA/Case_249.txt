Question: Adults with mild intellectual disabilities: can their reading comprehension ability be improved?

GPT is reasoning the answer...


**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content**: The question seeks to determine whether the reading comprehension abilities of adults with mild intellectual disabilities (ID) can be enhanced.
- **Key Information to Look For**:
  - Presence and nature of any intervention or instructional program aimed at improving reading comprehension.
  - Measurable outcomes indicating improvement in reading comprehension.
  - Comparison between different instructional methods, if any.
  - Long-term retention or transfer effects of the intervention.
  - The reliability and significance of the results.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Intervention**: The study implemented a 15-week intervention program teaching four specific reading comprehension strategies (summarizing, questioning, clarifying, predicting) through individual and group instruction.
- **Results**:
  - **Instruction Methods**: No significant difference was found between individual and group instruction, suggesting both methods are equally effective.
  - **Direct Effects**: Substantial improvements were noted in most of the taught strategies, except for questioning.
  - **Transfer Effects**: There was a significant and maintained improvement in general text comprehension, indicating that the skills acquired transferred to overall reading ability.
  - **Reliability**: The study included 38 participants with a range of IQs, and results were maintained at follow-up, supporting the reliability of the findings.
- **Relevance**: The evidence directly addresses the question by demonstrating that targeted instructional strategies can improve reading comprehension in adults with mild ID.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the study's findings, the intervention program effectively enhanced reading comprehension abilities in adults with mild intellectual disabilities. The significant improvements in both specific strategies and general reading comprehension, along with maintained results at follow-up, provide strong evidence supporting the effectiveness of such educational programs.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether adults with mild intellectual disabilities (ID) can improve their reading comprehension ability. Key information to identify in the abstract includes the study's intervention (teaching text comprehension strategies), outcomes (effects on reading comprehension), and conclusions.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Direct Effects**: The study found "substantial" posttest improvements on strategy tests (except for questioning).  
- **Transfer Effects**: The abstract states that "even more substantial" transfer effects occurred on general reading comprehension, which were maintained at follow-up.  
- **Long-term Maintenance**: Results on general text comprehension were "well maintained" at follow-up, indicating sustained improvement.  
- **Intervention Program Conclusion**: The abstract explicitly states, "The presently used intervention programme provides a good starting point for adults with ID to become better readers."  

The evidence is strong, as the intervention showed measurable and maintained improvements in general reading comprehension. The sample size (38 adults) and structured intervention (15 weekly lessons) add reliability. The question is directly addressed by the study's primary outcomes.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study provides clear evidence that teaching text comprehension strategies improved general reading comprehension in adults with mild ID, with effects sustained over time. The authors' conclusion supports this. Thus, the answer is "yes."  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**
Qwen selected: yes

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether reading comprehension ability in adults with mild intellectual disabilities (ID) can be improved through intervention. Key elements to evaluate include:  
- Direct effects of strategy instruction on reading comprehension.  
- Transfer effects to general reading comprehension.  
- Long-term maintenance of improvements.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study tested 38 adults with ID using strategy instruction (summarizing, questioning, clarifying, predicting).  
- **Direct effects**: Posttest-pretest contrasts showed substantial improvements for most strategies (except questioning).  
- **Transfer effects**: Significant improvement in general text comprehension, maintained at follow-up.  
- The authors conclude the intervention is "a good starting point for adults with ID to become better readers."  
- Limitations include no significant difference between group/individual instruction and questioning strategy’s lack of improvement. However, the transfer effects and maintenance support efficacy.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence demonstrates meaningful improvements in general reading comprehension, sustained over time. While some strategies (e.g., questioning) showed limited direct effects, the overall transfer effects and the authors’ conclusion strongly support a positive outcome.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: yes**
