**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content:** The question seeks to determine the safety of performing rectal anastomosis without a diverting stoma during gynecological debulking surgery.
- **Key Information to Look For:** Incidence of anastomotic leakage, complications, the presence or absence of diverting stomas, and the expertise of the surgeons involved.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results:** The study retrospectively analyzed 43 major colorectal procedures in 37 women undergoing gynecological cancer procedures. Only 3 patients had a diverting loop ileostomy, and 5 underwent Hartmann's procedure. The abstract concludes that low rectal resection can be performed safely without a diverting stoma by an experienced surgeon.
- **Strength and Reliability:** The study's retrospective nature may limit the strength of evidence due to potential biases. However, the specific mention of safety in the hands of experienced surgeons adds credibility.
- **Relevance to Question:** The evidence directly addresses the safety of rectal anastomosis without a diverting stoma in the context of gynecological debulking surgery.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the abstract, performing rectal anastomosis without a diverting stoma appears to be safe when conducted by an experienced surgeon. However, the retrospective design and limited sample size suggest that while the evidence is supportive, it may not be definitive.

**4. Final Answer:**
**My final choice is: "yes"**
GPT selected: yes

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether performing a rectal anastomosis during gynecological debulking surgery without a diverting stoma is safe. Key information to identify in the abstract includes the primary outcome (anastomotic leakage) and the study's conclusion regarding safety, particularly in cases without a stoma.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The abstract states that **"Low rectal resection during debulking procedures for gynaecological cancers with peritoneal carcinomatosis can safely be performed by an experienced surgeon without a diverting stoma."** This conclusion is explicitly supported by the study's findings. While the abstract does not provide detailed numerical comparisons of leakage rates between patients with and without stomas, the authors' conclusion directly addresses the question and is based on their analysis of complications (including anastomotic leakage) in 43 colorectal procedures. The study's focus on low rectal resections (the most common procedure, n=22) and the mention of only 3 patients receiving a diverting stoma suggest that the majority of cases did not use a stoma, yet the conclusion affirms safety in experienced hands.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The abstract's conclusion directly answers the question, asserting safety without a diverting stoma when performed by an experienced surgeon. While the data lacks explicit numerical comparisons, the authors' conclusion is definitive, and the study's context supports it. Thus, the answer is "yes."  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether rectal anastomosis during gynecological debulking surgery is safe without a diverting stoma. Key elements to evaluate include anastomotic leakage rates, complications, and the role of surgeon experience, as these are directly tied to safety outcomes.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The abstract states that among 37 patients undergoing colorectal resection during cytoreduction, low rectal resection (59% of cases) was performed without a diverting stoma in most cases (only 8% received one). The authors conclude that this approach is safe when performed by an experienced surgeon. However, specific leakage rates, comparative data between stoma and non-stoma groups, and statistical significance are not provided. The retrospective design and small sample size limit generalizability, but the explicit conclusion from the authors supports safety in experienced hands.  

**3. Conclusion**  
While the abstract lacks granular data, the authors’ direct assertion—based on their clinical experience and outcomes—suggests safety without a stoma in this context. The absence of reported high complication rates reinforces this, though the limited evidence quality warrants cautious interpretation.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: yes**
DeepSeek selected: yes

Initial consensus: All models selected yes
