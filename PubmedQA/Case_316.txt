**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content**: The primary question investigates whether the long-term outcomes of the transanal endorectal pull-through (TERPT) procedure are equivalent to those of the conventional transabdominal (ABD) pull-through in treating Hirschsprung disease (HD).
- **Key Information to Look For**:
  - Comparative long-term outcome scores between TERPT and ABD groups.
  - Specific aspects of outcomes, such as continence and stool patterns.
  - Statistical significance of any differences observed.
  - Consideration of confounding factors, such as age differences between groups.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results and Data**:
  - Total outcome scores were similar between TERPT and ABD groups after controlling for age.
  - The continence score was significantly better in the ABD group.
  - The stool pattern score was better in the TERPT group.
- **Strength and Reliability**:
  - The study included 41 patients, which is a relatively small sample size.
  - Statistical methods used (Student t test, analysis of covariance, logistic and linear regression) are appropriate for comparing groups.
  - The transition from ABD to TERPT over the study period may introduce selection bias.
- **Relevance to the Question**:
  - The findings directly address the long-term outcomes of both procedures.
  - The abstract concludes that more cases need to be studied for a definitive conclusion, indicating that the current evidence is not conclusive.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the study, there are some differences in specific outcome measures between TERPT and ABD pull-throughs, with ABD showing better continence scores and TERPT showing better stool patterns. However, overall scores were similar after adjusting for age, and the authors themselves indicate that more research is needed for a definitive conclusion.

**4. Final Answer**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether the long-term results of transanal pull-through (TERPT) are equivalent to those of transabdominal pull-through (ABD) for Hirschsprung disease (HD). Key outcomes to evaluate include continence, stool patterns, and overall scores. The study’s abstract provides comparative data on these metrics between the two surgical approaches.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Continence Score**: The ABD group had significantly better continence scores than the TERPT group.  
- **Stool Pattern Score**: TERPT performed better in stool pattern scores.  
- **Overall Scores**: Total scores were similar between groups.  
- **Age Adjustment**: Age differences between groups were controlled for, and it was found not to affect outcomes.  
- **Study Limitations**: The sample size (n=20 TERPT, n=21 ABD) is small, and the authors note that more cases are needed for definitive conclusions.  

The continence score, a critical aspect of quality of life, is explicitly worse in TERPT compared to ABD. While overall scores were similar, the question specifically asks if the **long-term results are equal**. Since continence—a key outcome—is significantly different, equivalence cannot be confirmed. However, the study’s small sample size and acknowledgment of the need for further research introduce some uncertainty.

**3. Conclusion**  
The results are not entirely equal because the ABD approach showed significantly better continence outcomes, a key long-term outcome measure. However, the study’s limitations (small sample size, non-definitive conclusions) suggest caution. The answer is "no" because the continence difference indicates non-equivalence, but the abstract’s mention of needing more data complicates a definitive "no." However, the study’s explicit finding of a statistically significant difference in continence (a critical outcome) outweighs the overall similarity in total scores. Thus, the answer is "no."

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether the long-term results of transanal pull-through (TERPT) are equal to transabdominal pull-through (ABD) for Hirschsprung disease. Key information to evaluate includes comparative outcomes (e.g., continence, stool patterns, enterocolitis) and statistical significance of differences between groups.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study found **similar overall scores** between TERPT and ABD groups.  
- **Significant differences** in specific outcomes:  
  - ABD had a **2-fold better continence score** (critical for quality of life).  
  - TERPT had better stool pattern and enterocolitis scores.  
- The authors acknowledged limitations (small sample size, retrospective design) and called for more studies to confirm findings.  
- Statistical adjustments for age did not alter the conclusion, strengthening internal validity.  

**3. Conclusion**  
While overall scores were similar, the significant difference in continence—a critical long-term outcome—indicates the results are **not fully equivalent**. The authors’ caution about needing further research introduces uncertainty, but the evidence presented shows clinically relevant disparities.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: no**

**1. Position Statement**

**I agree with the shared perspective of Qwen and DeepSeek.**

**2. Evaluation of Other Models**

Both Qwen and DeepSeek have thoroughly analyzed the provided study and reached the conclusion that the long-term results of the transanal pull-through (TERPT) are not equal to those of the transabdominal pull-through (ABD). Their arguments are well-founded based on the data:

- **Qwen** emphasized the significantly better continence scores in the ABD group, a critical long-term outcome that directly impacts the patient's quality of life. Despite acknowledging the study's limitations, Qwen correctly identified that a key outcome measure showed a substantial difference.
  
- **DeepSeek** similarly highlighted the significant disparity in continence scores, reinforcing the argument that the results are not fully equivalent. Additionally, DeepSeek noted the study's internal validity despite its limitations, lending weight to its conclusion.

Both models appropriately prioritized the continence score, a vital metric in assessing the long-term success of Hirschsprung disease surgeries, over the overall similarity in total scores.

**3. Medical Analysis and Argumentation**

Upon reevaluating the study's findings, it becomes evident that while the overall outcome scores between TERPT and ABD groups may appear similar after adjusting for age, the significant difference in continence scores cannot be overlooked. Continence is a paramount factor in the long-term management and quality of life for patients with Hirschsprung disease. A two-fold improvement in continence scores for the ABD group suggests a clinically meaningful advantage over TERPT.

Moreover, the study's abstract indicates better stool patterns and lower enterocolitis scores in the TERPT group, which are important but may not compensate for the deficits in continence. The necessity for more extensive research, as stated by the authors, points to the preliminary nature of these findings. However, the existing evidence presents a clear disparity in a critical outcome measure.

**4. Self-Questioning**

- **Has the rationale for my original choice truly been completely refuted?**
  
  Yes. The significant difference in continence scores, a crucial long-term outcome, strongly suggests non-equivalence between TERPT and ABD procedures. The other models effectively highlighted this point.

- **Is the new choice better than my original choice?**
  
  Yes. Aligning with the other models provides a more accurate and clinically relevant interpretation of the study's findings.

- **Why do I persist with or change my choice?**
  
  The compelling evidence regarding continence scores outweighs the notion of overall score similarity. Given that continence directly affects patient well-being, the "no" choice is more appropriate.

**5. Final Decision**

**My final choice is: "no"**

**1. Position Statement**  
**I agree with the common viewpoint of GPT and DeepSeek.**  

**2. Evaluation of Other Models**  
Both GPT and DeepSeek correctly identified the key findings of the study, particularly the significant disparity in continence scores favoring the abdominal approach. Their analyses appropriately prioritized continence as a critical long-term outcome, which directly impacts quality of life and functional recovery in Hirschsprung disease. However, two minor gaps exist:  
- **Underemphasis on "overall scores"**: While the abstract states that total scores were "somewhat better" for TERPT in stool pattern and enterocolitis but "similar" overall, both models did not clarify whether the total score equivalence was statistically tested.  
- **Limited discussion of study design**: The abstract mentions the study was "long-term" but does not specify follow-up duration or whether outcomes were assessed using validated tools (e.g., specific continence scoring systems). This context could strengthen or weaken the conclusions.  

**3. Medical Analysis and Argumentation**  
- **Key Outcomes**: Continence is a cardinal long-term outcome for patients with HD, as bowel control significantly affects daily functioning and psychosocial well-being. The two-fold improvement in continence scores for ABD is clinically meaningful and cannot be dismissed, even if other metrics (e.g., stool pattern, enterocolitis) favor TERPT.  
- **Study Limitations**: While the small sample size (n=41 total) and retrospective design limit generalizability, the statistically significant difference in continence suggests a real effect that warrants further investigation. The authors’ call for larger studies does not negate the current findings but highlights the need for validation.  
- **Overall Scores**: The abstract states "total scores were somewhat better for the TERPT group" but does not specify if this difference reached statistical significance. If total scores were not statistically different, the conclusion of "non-equivalence" due to the continence disparity remains valid.  

**4. Self-Questioning**  
- **Has the rationale for my original choice been refuted?**  
  No. The continence disparity, a critical outcome, remains unchallenged. Other models’ arguments reinforce this point.  
- **Is the new choice better than my original choice?**  
  No change is needed. Maintaining "no" aligns with the evidence and clinical context.  
- **Why I persist:** The study explicitly highlights a significant difference in continence, a key long-term outcome. Equivalence requires similarity in *all* critical outcomes, which is not met here.  

**5. Final Decision**  
**My final choice is: no**
Qwen selected: no

**1. Position Statement**  
**I agree with the shared viewpoint of GPT and Qwen.**  

**2. Evaluation of Other Models**  
Both GPT and Qwen provided robust analyses, emphasizing the critical disparity in continence scores favoring the abdominal approach (ABD). Their conclusions align with the evidence that continence—a pivotal long-term outcome—is significantly better in ABD, justifying the "no" answer. However, two minor gaps persist:  
- **Overemphasis on "overall similarity"**: While the abstract mentions "similar overall scores," this does not negate the clinically meaningful difference in continence. Neither model explicitly clarified that equivalence requires parity in *all* critical outcomes, not just aggregated scores.  
- **Study design limitations**: Qwen correctly noted the lack of follow-up duration details and validated scoring tools, but neither model addressed how these limitations might *weaken* the validity of the observed differences. For instance, retrospective designs risk selection bias, which could exaggerate the reported effect sizes.  

**3. Medical Analysis and Argumentation**  
- **Continence as a Decisive Factor**: Continence directly impacts quality of life and social integration in Hirschsprung disease. A 2-fold improvement in ABD’s continence score represents a **clinically significant advantage** that outweighs TERPT’s marginally better stool/enterocolitis outcomes.  
- **Statistical vs. Clinical Relevance**: The abstract does not specify whether the stool/enterocolitis differences reached statistical significance, whereas the continence disparity is explicitly described as significant. This hierarchy of evidence strengthens the argument for ABD’s superiority in critical domains.  
- **Study Validity**: While the small sample size and retrospective design limit generalizability, the authors’ adjustment for age and consistent findings after statistical corrections enhance internal validity.  

**4. Self-Questioning**  
- **Has the rationale for my original choice been refuted?**  
  No. The continence disparity remains the cornerstone of the argument, and no counterarguments from other models challenge this.  
- **Is the new choice better than my original choice?**  
  No change is needed. The shared conclusion aligns with the evidence and clinical prioritization of continence.  
- **Why I persist**: Equivalence requires comparable outcomes across *all* critical measures. The significant difference in continence—a cornerstone of long-term success—renders TERPT and ABD non-equivalent.

**My final choice is: no**
