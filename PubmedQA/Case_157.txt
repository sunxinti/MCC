**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content:** The question aims to determine whether ethnicity influences the location where cancer patients die.
- **Key Information to Look For:** Data on place of death categorized by ethnicity, statistical associations between ethnicity and place of death, and any trends or patterns observed in the study.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results:** The study analyzed 93,375 cancer deaths among individuals aged ≥65 in London from 2001-2010. It found that:
  - BAME groups were more likely to die in hospitals (PR > 1) and less likely to die at home or in hospices (PR < 1) compared to those born in the UK.
  - Statistical analyses (linear and Poisson regressions) confirmed these associations with high significance (p<0.001).
  - Although hospital deaths decreased over time across all groups, consistent gaps remained between different ethnicities.
- **Strength and Reliability:** The large sample size and use of robust statistical methods (linear and Poisson regression) enhance the reliability of the findings.
- **Relevance:** The evidence directly addresses the research question by linking ethnicity (proxied by country of birth) to place of death among cancer patients.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the study's findings, there is a statistically significant association between ethnicity and the place of death for cancer patients. BAME groups are more likely to die in hospitals and less likely to die at home or in hospices, indicating that ethnicity does affect where people with cancer die.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether ethnicity influences the place of death (PoD) for cancer patients. Key information to assess includes: (1) whether the study found differences in PoD across ethnic groups, (2) the statistical significance of these differences, and (3) whether the study’s proxy for ethnicity (country of birth) is valid for drawing conclusions.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The study analyzed 93,375 cancer deaths in London, using country of birth as an ethnicity proxy. Key findings:  
- Hospital deaths were **more likely** for those born in Asia (PR 1.12) and Africa (PR 1.11).  
- Hospice deaths were **less likely** for those born in Asia (PR 0.73), Africa (PR 0.83), and other regions.  
- Home deaths were **less likely** for Caribbean-born individuals (PR 0.91).  
- These associations persisted after adjusting for temporal trends.  

The large sample size, longitudinal analysis (2001–2010), and use of Poisson regression with adjusted estimates strengthen the evidence. The study explicitly states that PoD "varies by country of birth" and acknowledges persistent gaps despite overall trends. While country of birth is a proxy for ethnicity, it is a commonly accepted measure in such studies and sufficiently relevant for the question.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study provides clear statistical evidence that PoD differs significantly across ethnic groups (proxied by country of birth). Groups from Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean had systematically different odds of dying in hospitals, homes, or hospices compared to UK-born individuals. These differences were consistent over time and remained after adjusting for trends, suggesting ethnicity is a meaningful factor in PoD. The answer is "yes."

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether ethnicity influences where cancer patients die. The abstract examines place of death (PoD) patterns among UK BAME groups using country of birth as an ethnicity proxy. Key information includes trends in hospital, home, and hospice deaths across ethnic groups and statistical associations between ethnicity and PoD.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study analyzed 93,375 cancer deaths in London (2001–2010), finding significant differences in PoD by country of birth.  
- Adjusted analyses showed higher hospital death likelihood for Asian- and African-born individuals (PR 1.12 and 1.11, respectively) and lower hospice/home deaths for these groups (e.g., Asian-born: hospice PR 0.73, home PR 0.91 for Caribbean-born).  
- Time trends revealed persistent disparities despite overall improvements in home deaths.  
- The evidence is robust due to large sample size, longitudinal design, and statistical adjustments. However, country of birth as an ethnicity proxy may not fully capture cultural or socioeconomic factors.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The data strongly supports ethnic disparities in PoD, with BAME groups more likely to die in hospitals and less likely in hospices or at home. The study attributes these differences to ethnicity-linked factors, though it acknowledges unmeasured variables (e.g., preferences, access to care). The evidence directly answers the question affirmatively.
