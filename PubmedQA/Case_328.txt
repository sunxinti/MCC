**1. Question Analysis**

- **Core Content:** The research question seeks to determine whether uterine myomas (fibroids) increase in volume during pregnancy.
  
- **Key Information to Look For in the Abstract:**
  - Changes in uterine myoma volume across different pregnancy periods.
  - Percentage of myomas that decreased or increased in size.
  - Statistical significance and confidence intervals of the findings.
  - Overall conclusion drawn by the study authors.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**

- **Research Results and Data:**
  - **First to Second Trimester:**
    - 55.1% of uterine myomas decreased in size (mean decrease of 35%).
    - 44.9% increased in size (mean increase of 69%).
  - **Second to Third Trimester:**
    - 75% decreased in size (mean decrease of 30%).
    - 25% increased in size (mean increase of 102%).
  
- **Strength and Reliability:**
  - The study sample size of 107 patients provides a reasonable dataset.
  - Use of standardized ultrasound measurements adds reliability.
  - Confidence intervals indicate statistical robustness.
  
- **Relevance to the Question:**
  - The data directly addresses the volume changes of uterine myomas during pregnancy.
  - The overall trend shows a higher percentage of myomas decreasing in size, especially in the later stages of pregnancy.

**3. Conclusion**

Based on the evidence, uterine myomas are more likely to decrease in volume during pregnancy rather than grow. While a notable percentage does increase in size, the majority demonstrate a reduction in volume, especially as pregnancy progresses.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether uterine myomas grow during pregnancy. The key information to evaluate is whether the study's data supports growth of myomas, considering changes in volume across pregnancy stages. The abstract provides specific percentages of myomas that increased or decreased in volume at different intervals.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The study tracked 107 patients with uterine myomas and measured volume changes during three pregnancy intervals. Key findings:  
- Between the first and second periods (up to 19 weeks), **44.9% of myomas enlarged** (mean increase 69%), while **55.1% shrank**.  
- Between the second and third periods (20–30 weeks), **25% of myomas enlarged** (mean increase 102%), while **75% shrank**.  
The abstract concludes that myomas **commonly decrease in volume**, contradicting the belief that they grow. While a minority of myomas did grow (44.9% initially, then 25%), the majority shrank, and the mean volume changes indicated overall decreases.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study's conclusion explicitly states that myomas **do not commonly grow** during pregnancy. Although some myomas enlarged, the majority decreased, and the overall trend contradicts the belief

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether uterine myomas truly grow during pregnancy, challenging a common belief. The key information to evaluate includes the study's design, the proportion of myomas that increased/decreased in volume during specific pregnancy periods, and the statistical significance of these changes.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study tracked myoma volume in 107 patients across pregnancy stages.  
- Between the first half (≤19 weeks) and third quarter (20-30 weeks), **44.9% of myomas enlarged** (mean increase: 69%), while **55.1% decreased** (mean decrease: 35%).  
- Between the third quarter and last quarter (31 weeks to term), **25% enlarged** (mean increase: 102%) and **75% decreased** (mean decrease: 30%).  
- The abstract concludes that myomas **"commonly decrease in volume"** during pregnancy, contradicting the assumption of growth.  

The data shows that while a subset of myomas grow (especially earlier in pregnancy), the majority decrease in volume, particularly in later stages. The study’s conclusion is supported by statistically significant proportions (e.g., 75% decreasing in later pregnancy with 95% CIs), though variability exists.

**3. Conclusion**  
The answer is **"no"**: The study demonstrates that uterine myomas do not universally grow during pregnancy. Instead, a majority decrease in volume, especially in later stages. While growth occurs in some cases, the overall trend contradicts the common belief that myomas consistently enlarge.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: "no"**

**1. Position Statement**

I agree with DeepSeek's perspective.

**2. Evaluation of Other Models**

Qwen's answer of "maybe" suggests uncertainty regarding whether uterine myomas grow during pregnancy. While Qwen acknowledges that some myomas do increase in size, the predominant data indicates that the majority decrease in volume. Qwen's conclusion appears to lean towards ambiguity, which may stem from recognizing the subset of myomas that do grow. However, this does not adequately reflect the overall trend demonstrated by the study, where the majority of myomas decrease in size during pregnancy.

DeepSeek, on the other hand, provides a comprehensive analysis that aligns with the study's findings. By emphasizing that 75% of myomas decrease in size in the later stages of pregnancy and highlighting the statistical significance of these results, DeepSeek accurately represents the predominant outcome. This alignment with the study's conclusion reinforces the validity of the "no" answer.

**3. Medical Analysis and Argumentation**

The study in question presents compelling evidence that uterine myomas generally decrease in volume during pregnancy. Specifically:

- **First to Second Trimester:** 55.1% of myomas decreased in size with a mean decrease of 35%, while 44.9% increased in size with a mean increase of 69%.
  
- **Second to Third Trimester:** The trend becomes more pronounced, with 75% of myomas decreasing in size (mean decrease of 30%) and only 25% increasing (mean increase of 102%).

These findings suggest a temporal pattern where myomas are more likely to shrink as pregnancy progresses. The use of standardized ultrasound measurements and a reasonable sample size of 107 patients adds robustness to the study. The statistical significance, as indicated by confidence intervals, further supports the reliability of these outcomes.

While it is true that a subset of myomas does increase in size, the majority trend towards reduction, especially in the later stages of pregnancy. This challenges the common belief that myomas typically grow during pregnancy and aligns with the study's conclusion that myomas commonly decrease in volume.

**4. Self-Questioning**

Has the rationale for my original choice truly been completely refuted? No. The evidence presented in both my analysis and DeepSeek's aligns with the study's findings, which indicate that myomas are more likely to decrease in size during pregnancy.

Is the new choice better than my original choice? No change is necessary as my original choice is well-supported by the evidence.

**1. Position Statement**  
**I disagree with their viewpoints because:** the medical literature abstract explicitly states that myomas "commonly decrease in volume" during pregnancy, and the data provided supports a majority trend toward shrinkage. However, my original analysis concluded "maybe" due to recognizing the variability in individual myoma behavior. While GPT and DeepSeek argue "no," I maintain that the question’s phrasing ("do myomas *really* grow?") allows for nuance, as a subset of myomas *does* enlarge despite the overall trend.  

**2. Evaluation of Other Models**  
- **GPT and DeepSeek’s "no" conclusion** overemphasizes the majority trend while underestimating the significance of the 44.9% (first interval) and 25% (second interval) of myomas that *did* grow. The question asks whether myomas "really grow," not whether growth is the *most common* outcome.  
- Both models dismiss the "maybe" answer as overly ambiguous, but this ignores the study’s acknowledgment of variability (e.g., "some myomas enlarged"). The abstract itself states that the finding contradicts "common belief," implying that growth is not *universal*, not that it is *impossible*.  

**3. Medical Analysis and Argumentation**  
- **Key Data Nuances:**  
  - **First Interval (≤19 weeks):** While 55.1% of myomas shrank, **44.9% still grew significantly** (mean increase of 69%). This is a substantial minority.  
  - **Second Interval (20–30 weeks):** Although shrinkage becomes more common (75%), **25% of myomas continued to grow** (mean increase of 102%), which is clinically meaningful.  
  - **Overall:** The study does not state that myomas *never* grow during pregnancy but rather that shrinkage is more common.  

- **Clinical Context:**  
  - Uterine myomas are heterogeneous, and individual tumor behavior varies based on factors like location, size, and hormonal sensitivity. The study’s conclusion addresses the *common* outcome but does not negate the possibility of growth in specific cases.  
  - The abstract’s wording ("commonly decrease") supports "no" for the *common belief* of universal growth, but the question asks whether myomas *really grow* (i.e., whether growth is possible). This distinction justifies "maybe."  

- **Statistical Considerations:**  
  - The mean volume changes (e.g., 69% increase for growing myomas) highlight that while fewer myomas grow, those that do may enlarge substantially. This variability is clinically relevant and supports the need for cautious interpretation.  

**4. Self-Questioning**  
- **Has the rationale for my original choice been refuted?** No. The study confirms growth occurs in a subset of myomas, even if it is less common.  
- **Is "no" a better choice?** Not entirely. The question’s phrasing ("do myomas *really* grow?") implies inquiry into whether growth is plausible, not whether it is the dominant outcome. Thus, "maybe" remains valid to reflect this nuance.  

**5. Final Decision**  
**My final choice is: "maybe"**
Qwen selected: maybe

**1. Position Statement**  
**I disagree with their viewpoints because:** While Qwen’s emphasis on variability in myoma behavior is valid, the study’s conclusion directly addresses the *common belief* that myomas grow during pregnancy. The question ("do myomas *really* grow?") challenges this belief, and the data shows that the majority of myomas *decrease* in volume, especially in later stages. "No" is the correct answer because it aligns with the study’s conclusion that growth is not the predominant outcome.  

**2. Evaluation of Other Models**  
- **Qwen’s "maybe"** conflates the existence of growth in a minority of cases with the question’s focus on refuting the *common belief* in universal or predominant growth. The study explicitly states that myomas "commonly decrease," which directly contradicts the assumption that they "really grow" as a general rule.  
- **GPT’s "no"** correctly emphasizes the majority trend but could better address the clinical relevance of minority growth. However, this does not invalidate the conclusion that the *common belief* is incorrect.  

**3. Medical Analysis and Argumentation**  
- **Study Design and Clinical Context:**  
  - The study’s longitudinal design (tracking 107 patients) and use of standardized ultrasound measurements provide robust evidence for temporal trends.  
  - **Key Data:**  
    - **First half to third quarter (≤19 to 20–30 weeks):** 55.1% of myomas decreased (mean: -35%), while 44.9% increased (mean: +69%).  
    - **Third quarter to term (31+ weeks):** 75% decreased (mean: -30%), 25% increased (mean: +102%).  
  - **Interpretation:** The increasing proportion of shrinking myomas as pregnancy progresses (55.1% → 75%) demonstrates a clear trend toward volume reduction. While growth occurs in subsets, the abstract’s conclusion explicitly states that myomas "commonly decrease," which answers the question’s challenge to the common belief.  

- **Question Framing:**  
  - The phrase "do myomas *really* grow?" implicitly questions whether growth is a universal or typical phenomenon. The study’s findings confirm that it is *not* typical, even though growth occurs in some cases. Clinically, this distinction is critical for counseling patients: while monitoring is necessary for the minority with enlarging myomas, the majority can expect stability or regression.  

- **Statistical Significance:**  
  - The confidence intervals (not explicitly provided in the abstract but implied by the study’s methodology) likely support the statistical significance of the majority shrinkage trend, particularly in later stages.  

**4. Self-Questioning**  
- **Has the rationale for my original choice been refuted?** No. The study’s conclusion and data remain consistent with "no" as the answer to whether myomas "really grow" during pregnancy.  
- **Is "maybe" a better choice?** No. While Qwen’s argument highlights variability, the question’s focus on the *common belief* necessitates a response that reflects the predominant trend, not individual exceptions.

**1. Position Statement**

**I agree with DeepSeek's perspective.**

**2. Evaluation of Other Models**

Qwen's argument for selecting "maybe" emphasizes the subset of uterine myomas that do increase in size during pregnancy. While it is accurate that approximately 44.9% of myomas increased in size during the first to second trimester and 25% continued to grow into the second to third trimester, Qwen's conclusion may overemphasize these subsets in the context of the overall findings. The majority of myomas (55.1% initially and 75% later) decreased in volume, which is a significant trend that challenges the common belief of myoma growth during pregnancy. Qwen's "maybe" reflects an acknowledgment of variability but may inadvertently suggest that growth is as prevalent as reduction, which is not supported by the data.

DeepSeek maintains that the predominant trend is a decrease in myoma volume, aligning with the study's conclusion that myomas "commonly decrease in volume." This perspective accurately represents the overall finding that the majority of myomas do not grow during pregnancy, even though a notable minority does experience growth. DeepSeek effectively balances the acknowledgment of variability with the emphasis on the predominant trend.

**3. Medical Analysis and Argumentation**

The study provides robust evidence that uterine myomas generally decrease in volume during pregnancy. Key findings include:

- **First to Second Trimester:** 55.1% of myomas decreased in size (mean decrease of 35%), while 44.9% increased (mean increase of 69%).
  
- **Second to Third Trimester:** The trend towards reduction becomes more pronounced, with 75% of myomas decreasing in size (mean decrease of 30%) and only 25% increasing (mean increase of 102%).

These results demonstrate a clear temporal pattern where the likelihood of myoma shrinkage increases as pregnancy progresses. The significant decrease in the percentage of growing myomas from the first trimester to later stages underscores that while growth is possible, it is not the prevailing outcome.

Furthermore, the study's methodology—using standardized ultrasound measurements and a substantial sample size of 107 patients—adds validity to the findings. The statistical significance of the results, as implied by confidence intervals, reinforces the reliability of the observed trends.

Clinically, this information is crucial for managing expectations and treatment plans for pregnant patients with uterine myomas. While healthcare providers should remain vigilant for cases where myomas may grow, the overarching evidence supports that such growth is not the norm.

**4. Self-Questioning**

- **Has the rationale for my original choice truly been completely refuted?**
  
  No. While Qwen highlights the subset of myomas that do grow, the overarching data indicates that the majority decrease in size during pregnancy. The study's conclusion emphasizes the commonality of volume reduction, aligning with the "no" response.

- **Is the new choice better than my original choice?**
  
  No change is necessary. The original choice of "no" remains well-supported by the evidence. While acknowledging the variability in myoma behavior is important, the predominant trend toward shrinkage justifies maintaining the original position.

**1. Position Statement**  
**I agree with GPT and DeepSeek's viewpoints** because the study’s conclusion directly refutes the common belief that myomas grow during pregnancy by emphasizing that shrinkage is the predominant trend. While acknowledging variability, the question’s focus on whether myomas "really grow" aligns with the study’s conclusion that growth is not the common outcome.  

**2. Evaluation of Other Models**  
- **My original "maybe" stance** overemphasized the minority cases of growth while underweighting the study’s explicit conclusion that myomas "commonly decrease in volume." The question challenges the validity of the belief that myomas grow, not whether growth is possible. The abstract’s framing supports "no" as the answer to this challenge.  
- GPT and DeepSeek correctly highlight the majority trend toward shrinkage (55.1% initially, 75% later) as the key takeaway. While my argument about variability is valid, it does not negate the study’s primary conclusion.  

**3. Medical Analysis and Argumentation**  
- **Study’s Primary Conclusion:** The abstract explicitly states that myomas “commonly decrease in volume,” directly contradicting the common belief. This framing prioritizes the majority outcome over individual exceptions.  
- **Clinical Relevance:** The question’s phrasing (“do myomas *really* grow?”) implies inquiry into whether the belief is valid. Since the study demonstrates that shrinkage is the common outcome, the answer is “no.”

**1. Position Statement**  
**I disagree with their viewpoints because:** While Qwen acknowledges the majority trend toward shrinkage, their final choice of "maybe" inappropriately elevates minority growth cases to a level of clinical equivalence with the predominant outcome. The study’s conclusion explicitly refutes the common belief that myomas grow during pregnancy by stating they "commonly decrease in volume." The question’s phrasing ("do myomas *really* grow?") challenges this belief, and the data overwhelmingly supports "no" as the answer.  

---

**2. Evaluation of Other Models**  
- **Qwen’s "maybe"** conflates statistical variability with clinical relevance. While 25% of myomas grew in later pregnancy (with a mean increase of 102%), this does not justify hedging the answer to "maybe." The study’s conclusion prioritizes the majority outcome (75% shrinkage) as the defining trend, which directly answers the question. Qwen’s stance risks perpetuating the very misconception the study aims to correct.  
- **GPT’s "no"** aligns with the study’s conclusion but could strengthen its argument by explicitly addressing why minority growth cases do not undermine the validity of "no" as the correct answer.  

---

**3. Medical Analysis and Argumentation**  
- **Temporal Dynamics of Myoma Behavior:**  
  - The study demonstrates a *progressive shift* toward shrinkage: 55.1% of myomas decreased in the first interval (≤19–30 weeks), rising to 75% in the second interval (31+ weeks). This trend highlights that **shrinkage becomes more dominant as pregnancy advances**, further undermining the notion of universal growth.  
  - **Mean Volume Changes:** Even in the subset of growing myomas, the *absolute volume increase* (e.g., +102% in later stages) must be contextualized. A doubling in size for a small myoma (e.g., 2 cm³ → 4 cm³) may not pose clinical risks comparable to larger myomas that shrink (e.g., 10 cm³ → 7 cm³). The abstract does not stratify outcomes by baseline size, but the overall trend favors regression.  

- **Clinical Implications of the Question’s Framing:**  
  - The question challenges whether myomas "really grow" as a general rule. The study’s data shows that **growth is the exception, not the rule**, with only 25% of myomas enlarging in later pregnancy. Clinically, this supports counseling patients that *shrinkage or stability is more likely than growth*.  

- **Limitations of Minority Growth:**  
  - While growth in 25% of cases warrants monitoring, it does not validate the common belief. The study’s conclusion explicitly states that myomas "commonly decrease," which directly answers the question.  

---

**4. Self-Questioning**  
- **Has the rationale for my original choice been refuted?** No. The study’s conclusion and temporal data remain unambiguously supportive of "no." Qwen’s "maybe" overemphasizes exceptions rather than the predominant trend.  
- **Is "maybe" a better choice?** No. The question’s focus on refuting the common belief requires prioritizing the majority outcome. "Maybe" introduces unnecessary ambiguity that misrepresents the study’s conclusion.

**1. Position Statement**

**I agree with DeepSeek's perspective.**

**2. Evaluation of Other Models**

- **Qwen's "maybe":** Qwen initially adopted a "maybe" stance, highlighting that a subset of uterine myomas do increase in size during pregnancy (44.9% in the first to second trimester and 25% in the second to third trimester). While acknowledging these cases is important, the "maybe" response introduces ambiguity that doesn't fully align with the study's overarching conclusion. The majority of myomas (55.1% initially and 75% later) decrease in volume, which is a more definitive trend. Qwen's approach may inadvertently suggest that growth is as prevalent as reduction, which misrepresents the data's emphasis on shrinkage.

- **DeepSeek's "no":** DeepSeek maintains that the predominant trend is a decrease in myoma volume, aligning well with the study's conclusion that myomas "commonly decrease in volume." This perspective accurately reflects the majority of cases and appropriately downplays the minority where growth occurs, providing a clear and evidence-based response to the question.

**3. Medical Analysis and Argumentation**

The study in question presents compelling evidence that uterine myomas typically decrease in volume during pregnancy. Key findings include:

- **First to Second Trimester:** 55.1% of myomas decreased in size with a mean decrease of 35%, while 44.9% increased with a mean increase of 69%.
  
- **Second to Third Trimester:** The trend towards reduction becomes more pronounced, with 75% of myomas decreasing in size (mean decrease of 30%) and only 25% increasing (mean increase of 102%).

These results indicate a clear temporal pattern where the likelihood of myoma shrinkage increases as pregnancy progresses. The initial near-equilibrium between growth and shrinkage in the first trimester shifts significantly towards reduction in the later stages of pregnancy. 

The study's methodology, which involved standardized ultrasound measurements and a substantial sample size of 107 patients, adds robustness to the findings. The statistical significance implied by the reported confidence intervals supports the reliability of the observed trends.

From a clinical standpoint, these findings are vital for managing pregnant patients with uterine myomas. While it is essential to monitor cases where myomas may grow, the predominant trend of volume reduction should inform patient counseling and treatment planning, alleviating undue concern based on common misconceptions.

**4. Self-Questioning**

- **Has the rationale for my original choice truly been completely refuted?**
  
  No. The study's data overwhelmingly support that the majority of uterine myomas decrease in volume during pregnancy. While Qwen rightly points out the instances of growth, these cases are a minority and do not negate the predominant trend.

- **Is the new choice better than my original choice?**
  
  No change is necessary. The original choice of "no" remains well-supported by the evidence. Emphasizing the majority trend towards shrinkage provides a clear and accurate answer to the question posed.

**1. Position Statement**  
**I agree with the common viewpoint of GPT and DeepSeek** because the study’s data and conclusion decisively emphasize that uterine myomas predominantly shrink during pregnancy. While acknowledging variability, the question explicitly challenges the validity of the belief that myomas "really grow," which the study refutes by demonstrating shrinkage as the common outcome. My original "maybe" stance overemphasized minority cases, misrepresenting the study’s primary conclusion.  

**2. Evaluation of Other Models**  
- **GPT’s "no":** Strongly aligned with the study’s conclusion by highlighting the progressive shift toward shrinkage (55.1% initially to 75% later). However, it could have more explicitly addressed why minority growth cases do not invalidate the "no" answer.  
- **DeepSeek’s "no":** Effectively critiqued the ambiguity of "maybe" and emphasized the study’s explicit conclusion. However, it overstates the need to "contextualize absolute volume changes," as the question focuses on whether growth is the common outcome, not clinical severity.  
- **My original "maybe":** Incorrectly treated growth and shrinkage as clinically equivalent outcomes, despite the study’s emphasis on shrinkage as the common trend. This misaligned with the question’s intent to validate or refute the belief that myomas grow.  

**3. Medical Analysis and Argumentation**  
- **Study’s Temporal Dynamics:** The shift from 55.1% shrinkage (first interval) to 75% shrinkage (second interval) underscores that growth becomes less common as pregnancy progresses. This trend supports the conclusion that shrinkage is the dominant pattern.  
- **Clinical Relevance of the Question:** The phrasing “do myomas *really* grow?” implies a yes/no challenge to the common belief. Since only 25% of myomas grew in later stages, the answer must prioritize the majority outcome.  
- **Statistical Nuance:** While growth cases had a mean increase of 102%, this reflects a small subset (25%) and does not negate the overarching trend. The study’s confidence intervals (not detailed in the abstract) likely reinforce the statistical significance of the shrinkage trend.  

**4. Self-Questioning**  
- **Has the rationale for my original choice been refuted?** Yes. The study’s explicit conclusion that myomas “commonly decrease” directly contradicts the premise of “maybe,” which implies equal likelihood of growth or shrinkage.  
- **Is the new choice better than my original choice?** Yes. “No” accurately reflects the majority trend, aligns with the study’s conclusion, and appropriately addresses the question’s intent to challenge the belief that myomas grow during pregnancy.

**1. Position Statement**  
**I agree with the shared viewpoint of GPT and Qwen** because their final "no" aligns with the study’s explicit conclusion that myomas "commonly decrease in volume," directly refuting the common belief in universal growth. However, I maintain that my original critique of Qwen’s initial "maybe" stance remains valid, as it risked overemphasizing minority growth cases.  

---

**2. Evaluation of Other Models**  
- **GPT’s "no":** Correctly emphasizes the majority trend (75% shrinkage in later pregnancy) but inadequately addresses why the 25% growth cases (with a mean 102% increase) do not warrant a "maybe." While statistically minor, these cases are clinically significant for affected patients. GPT’s argument would benefit from explicitly distinguishing between population-level trends (supporting "no") and individual variability.  
- **Qwen’s revised "no":** Appropriately rectifies its earlier "maybe" by prioritizing the study’s conclusion but glosses over the methodological nuance that growth cases, though minority, are non-trivial (25% in late pregnancy). This could mislead clinicians into dismissing growth entirely, which is inconsistent with the study’s full data.  

---

**3. Medical Analysis and Argumentation**  
- **Clinical vs. Statistical Significance:**  
  - While 75% shrinkage is the dominant trend, the 25% of myomas that grow (with a mean doubling in volume) represent a clinically actionable subgroup. For example, a myoma increasing from 5 cm³ to 10 cm³ may cause pain, preterm labor, or obstetric complications. The study’s abstract does not stratify outcomes by baseline size or location, leaving room for clinically relevant growth in specific cases.  
  - However, the question’s phrasing ("do myomas *really* grow?") challenges the *general belief* in universal growth, not the existence of exceptions. The study’s conclusion explicitly prioritizes shrinkage as the common outcome, making "no" the evidence-based answer.  

- **Temporal Dynamics Revisited:**  
  - The shift from 44.9% growth in early pregnancy to 25% in later stages underscores that growth becomes less frequent over time. This progression reinforces that shrinkage is the predominant *final* outcome, aligning with "no" as the answer.  

- **Limitations of the Abstract:**  
  - The abstract lacks data on absolute volumes (e.g., baseline sizes of growing vs. shrinking myomas) and clinical outcomes (e.g., complications). Without this, the 102% mean increase in growing myomas cannot be fully contextualized. However, the study’s conclusion remains unambiguous: shrinkage is common.  

---

**4. Self-Questioning**  
- **Has the rationale for my original choice been refuted?** No. The study’s conclusion and temporal data still support "no" as the majority trend. GPT and Qwen’s alignment with this position strengthens its validity.  
- **Is "maybe" a better choice?** No. While growth occurs in 25% of cases, the question targets the validity of the *common belief* in myoma growth during pregnancy. The study’s conclusion explicitly rejects this belief, making "no" the only answer consistent with the evidence.
