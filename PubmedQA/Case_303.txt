Question: Thrombosis prophylaxis in hospitalised medical patients: does prophylaxis in all patients make sense?

**1. Question Analysis**
   
The core question is whether implementing thrombosis prophylaxis for all hospitalized medical patients is justified. The key information to look for in the abstract includes the overall incidence of venous thrombosis in the general internal ward population, the incidence among specific subgroups (e.g., patients with malignancy), and the comparison of these findings to existing literature.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
   
The study investigated 6,332 hospitalized patients over four years, finding a low overall incidence of symptomatic venous thrombosis (0.6%). However, among patients with malignancies, the incidence was significantly higher (2.7%) compared to those without cancer (0.3%). The relative risk associated with malignancy was substantial (10.0 with a 95% confidence interval of 5.3-18.9), indicating a strong association between cancer and increased risk of venous thrombosis. The overall low incidence in the general patient population suggests that universal prophylaxis may not be necessary. The evidence is reliable within the context of this study, but it highlights the need for targeted prophylaxis in high-risk groups, such as cancer patients.

**3. Conclusion**
   
Based on the low overall incidence of venous thrombosis among all hospitalized medical patients and the significantly higher risk in specific subgroups like those with malignancies, the evidence suggests that universal thrombosis prophylaxis for all medical inpatients may not be justified. Instead, a more selective approach targeting high-risk groups appears to be more feasible and evidence-based.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether thrombosis prophylaxis should be given to **all hospitalized medical patients**. Key points to evaluate:  
- Overall incidence of venous thrombosis in the studied population.  
- Presence of risk factors (e.g., malignancy) that significantly increase thrombosis risk.  
- Whether the data support universal prophylaxis or targeted prophylaxis in high-risk subgroups.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Incidence Data**: The study reports an overall incidence of **0.6%** (39/6332 patients) for symptomatic venous thrombosis during hospitalization.  
  - **Cancer patients**: 2.7% incidence (24/876), with a **relative risk of 10** compared to non-cancer patients.  
  - **Non-cancer patients**: 0.3% incidence (15/5456).  
- **Conclusion from the Study**: The authors explicitly state that the **overall low incidence (0.6%) does not justify prophylaxis for all medical patients**. They highlight cancer as a strong risk factor and suggest further studies on prophylaxis in this subgroup.  
- **Strength of Evidence**: The study includes a large sample size (6,332 patients) and calculates relative risks with confidence intervals, supporting the conclusion that cancer is a critical risk factor.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The studyâ€™s data shows that thrombosis prophylaxis for **all hospitalized medical patients** is unnecessary, as the overall incidence is low (0.6%). However, cancer patients have a markedly higher risk (2.7%), suggesting prophylaxis should be targeted to this subgroup. The abstract explicitly concludes that universal prophylaxis is unjustified.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether universal thrombosis prophylaxis for all hospitalized medical patients is justified. Key information to evaluate includes the overall incidence of venous thrombosis in medical inpatients, subgroup risk differences (e.g., cancer vs. non-cancer patients), and the study's conclusions regarding prophylaxis feasibility.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study found a low overall incidence of symptomatic venous thrombosis (0.6%) during hospitalization in a general internal medicine ward.  
- Cancer patients had a significantly higher incidence (2.7%) compared to non-cancer patients (0.3%), with a relative risk of 10.0.  
- The authors concluded that the low overall incidence does not justify universal prophylaxis but identified cancer as a high-risk subgroup warranting further study for targeted prophylaxis.  
- The evidence is observational and retrospective, with a large sample size (6,332 patients), but the study design limits causal inference. The conclusions align with the data, emphasizing risk stratification over blanket prophylaxis.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study explicitly states that universal prophylaxis is not justified due to the low overall thrombosis risk. While cancer patients represent a high-risk subgroup, the question specifically addresses prophylaxis for *all* patients. Thus, the evidence supports a "no" answer.
