Question: Quaternary cytoreductive surgery in ovarian cancer: does surgical effort still matter?

----- GPT's initial response -----

**1. Question Analysis**

The core question is whether surgical effort, specifically quaternary cytoreductive surgery (QC), remains significant in the treatment of ovarian cancer (epithelial ovarian cancer, EOC) during relapse. Key information to identify includes the impact of QC on surgical outcomes and overall survival (OS) in patients with EOC relapse, as well as factors influencing these outcomes.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**

The abstract presents a study of 49 EOC patients undergoing QC over 12 years. Key findings include:

- **Survival Benefit:** Patients achieving complete tumor clearance had a significantly longer OS (43 months) compared to those with residual tumors (13.4 months, P=0.001).
- **Postoperative Chemotherapy:** Patients receiving chemotherapy post-QC had a longer OS (40.5 months) versus those who did not (12.03 months, P<0.001).
- **Predictive Factors:** Multifocal tumor dissemination was associated with incomplete resection, higher morbidity, and lower survival.
- **Operative Morbidity and Mortality:** Major operative morbidity was 28.6%, and 30-day mortality was 2%.

The abstract concludes that maximal therapeutic effort through optimal surgery and chemotherapy significantly prolongs survival in a selected group of patients, even during the third relapse of EOC.

**3. Conclusion**

The evidence suggests that surgical effort, in the form of QC, significantly impacts survival outcomes in relapsed EOC patients. Achieving complete tumor clearance and administering postoperative chemotherapy are associated with improved OS. However, patient selection is crucial, as factors like multifocal tumor dissemination affect outcomes.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether surgical effort (specifically quaternary cytoreductive surgery) in recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) still confers a survival benefit. Key factors to evaluate include surgical outcomes (e.g., residual tumor status), survival data, and the impact of postoperative chemotherapy. The abstract must be analyzed to determine if maximal surgical effort (e.g., achieving no macroscopic tumor residuals) correlates with improved survival.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Surgical Outcomes and Survival**: The abstract states that patients with **no tumor residuals** after quaternary cytoreduction had a **mean OS of 43 months**, compared to **13.4 months** for those with residuals (P=0.001). This strong statistical significance (p=0.001) indicates that complete cytoreduction is associated with significantly better survival.  
- **Postoperative Chemotherapy**: Patients who received chemotherapy after surgery had a **mean OS of 40.5 months**, versus 12.03 months without it (P<0.001). However, the question focuses on surgical effort, not chemotherapy.  
- **Multivariate Analysis**: Optimal surgery (maximal cytoreduction) was identified as a protective factor for survival, while multifocal tumor dissemination predicted worse outcomes. The conclusion explicitly states that combining surgery and chemotherapy prolongs survival in selected patients.  
- **Limitations**: The study is retrospective (12-year observational data), and the sample size (n=49) is small. However, the survival differences are large and statistically significant, supporting the conclusion.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence clearly shows that achieving **no residual tumor** after quaternary cytoreduction is strongly associated with prolonged survival (43 vs. 13.4 months, P=0.001). The abstractâ€™s conclusion directly states that maximal surgical effort combined with chemotherapy improves outcomes. Thus, surgical effort (aiming for complete cytoreduction) does matter in this advanced setting.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether surgical effort (specifically achieving optimal tumor resection) remains relevant in quaternary cytoreductive surgery (QC) for recurrent ovarian cancer. Key information to evaluate includes survival outcomes linked to residual tumor status and surgical morbidity/mortality.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study reports that patients with **no residual tumors** after QC had significantly longer mean overall survival (OS) compared to those with residual disease (43 vs. 13.4 months; *P=0.001*).  
- Postoperative chemotherapy further improved survival (40.5 vs. 12.03 months; *P<0.001*).  
- Multivariate analysis identified **multifocal tumor dissemination** as a predictor of incomplete resection and worse outcomes, while postoperative chemotherapy improved OS.  
- The abstract concludes that combining **optimal surgery** (maximal tumor clearance) with chemotherapy prolongs survival in selected patients.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The data strongly associate **complete tumor resection** (a marker of surgical effort) with survival benefits, even in this advanced relapse setting. While patient selection and postoperative chemotherapy influence outcomes, surgical effort (achieving no residuals) remains a critical factor. Thus, the answer is **"yes"**.

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: yes**
DeepSeek selected: yes

Initial consensus: All models selected yes
