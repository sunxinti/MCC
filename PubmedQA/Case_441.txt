**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content:** The research question seeks to determine whether treating amblyopia in children leads to the normalization of subfoveal choroidal thickness in amblyopic eyes.
- **Key Information to Look For:**
  - Measurements of choroidal thickness before and after amblyopia treatment.
  - Comparison between amblyopic eyes and fellow (non-amblyopic) eyes post-treatment.
  - Statistical significance of any changes observed in choroidal thickness following treatment.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results and Data:**
  - Initial choroidal thickness was significantly higher in amblyopic eyes compared to fellow eyes (p = 0.019).
  - After six months of treatment:
    - No significant change in choroidal thickness in amblyopic eyes (p = 0.428).
    - No significant change in fellow eyes (p = 0.343).
    - Amblyopic eyes still exhibited higher choroidal thickness than fellow eyes (p = 0.006).
- **Strength and Reliability:**
  - The study involved a prospective analysis of 32 children, which provides a controlled environment for assessing changes over time.
  - Use of spectral domain enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography ensures precise measurement of choroidal thickness.
- **Relevance to the Question:**
  - Directly measures the variable of interest (choroidal thickness) before and after amblyopia treatment.
  - Addresses the comparison between treated amblyopic eyes and fellow eyes, which is essential for assessing normalization.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the study, while amblyopia treatment effectively improved visual acuity in children, it did not lead to a significant change in subfoveal choroidal thickness. Moreover, the treated amblyopic eyes continued to have a higher choroidal thickness compared to fellow eyes even after treatment, indicating that normalization was not achieved.

**4. Final Answer**
**My final choice is: "no"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether amblyopia treatment (specifically a six-month regimen including glasses, refractive adaptation, and occlusion) normalizes subfoveal choroidal thickness in anisometropic hyperopic amblyopic children. The key focus is whether treatment reduces choroidal thickness in the amblyopic eye to match that of the fellow eye.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Results from the study**:  
  - Pre-treatment: Amblyopic eyes had significantly thicker choroids than fellow eyes (p=0.019).  
  - Post-treatment: No significant change in choroidal thickness in either the amblyopic eyes (p=0.428) or fellow eyes (p=0.343).  
  - Despite improved visual acuity in amblyopic eyes (p<0.001), choroidal thickness remained significantly higher in amblyopic eyes compared to fellow eyes post-treatment (p=0.006).  
- **Strength/Reliability**: The study is prospective, uses objective imaging (SD-OCT), and directly measures the outcome. The lack of change in choroidal thickness is statistically supported.  
- **Relevance**: The question directly addresses whether treatment normalizes choroidal thickness, and the results explicitly show no normalization (thickness remained higher in amblyopic eyes post-treatment).  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study demonstrates that amblyopia treatment improved visual acuity but did not reduce subfoveal choroidal thickness in amblyopic eyes to levels comparable with fellow eyes. Since choroidal thickness remained abnormal (thicker) post-treatment, the answer is **"no"**.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "no"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether amblyopia treatment normalizes subfoveal choroidal thickness in amblyopic children. Key points to evaluate include:  
- Pre- and post-treatment choroidal thickness measurements in amblyopic vs. fellow eyes.  
- Statistical significance of changes in choroidal thickness after treatment.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study found significantly thicker choroids in amblyopic eyes pre-treatment compared to fellow eyes (*p=0.019*).  
- After six months of treatment (glasses, patching), visual acuity improved significantly (*p<0.001*), but **no significant changes** occurred in choroidal thickness for amblyopic (*p=0.428*) or fellow eyes (*p=0.343*).  
- Post-treatment, amblyopic eyes still had thicker choroids than fellow eyes (*p=0.006*), indicating no normalization.  
- The evidence is robust: prospective design, objective measurements (OCT), and clear statistical results.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The treatment improved visual acuity but did not reduce choroidal thickness in amblyopic eyes. The persistent thickening suggests choroidal changes are not normalized by standard amblyopia therapy.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: no**
