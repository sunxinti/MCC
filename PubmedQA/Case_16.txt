**1. Question Analysis**

The core question is whether the knowledge of estimated fetal weight obtained through ultrasound (US-EFW) is a modifiable risk factor for cesarean delivery (CD). Key information to look for includes:

- The association between US-EFW and CD rates.
- Whether this association remains significant after controlling for confounding factors.
- The potential for modifying US-EFW practices to influence CD rates.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**

The study presented is a retrospective cohort analysis involving 2,329 singleton, term live births. Key findings include:

- **CD Rates:** Women with US-EFW had higher CD rates (15.7%) compared to those without US-EFW (10.2%), which was statistically significant (P<.001).
- **Adjusted Analysis:** After adjusting for potential confounders, US-EFW remained an independent risk factor for CD with an odds ratio of 1.44 (95% CI: 1.1-1.9).
- **Fetal Weight Specifics:** The risk of CD increased further when the US-EFW was greater than 3,500 grams, with an odds ratio of 1.8 (95% CI: 1.3-2.7).

The study's strengths include a sizable cohort and adjustment for confounders, enhancing the reliability of the association between US-EFW and CD. However, as a retrospective study from a single center, there may be limitations regarding generalizability and potential unmeasured confounding factors.

**3. Conclusion**

The evidence suggests that knowledge of US-EFW is associated with an increased risk of cesarean delivery, and this association persists even after adjusting for other factors. Moreover, the study posits that acquiring US-EFW near term is a potentially modifiable risk factor, implying that changes in how and when US-EFW information is used could influence CD rates.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether "estimated fetal weight by ultrasound (US-EFW) is a modifiable risk factor for cesarean delivery (CD)." The key elements to address are:  
- Whether US-EFW itself (not just fetal size) influences CD rates.  
- Whether this relationship is independent of other confounders.  
- Whether the factor (US-EFW knowledge) is modifiable.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The study found:  
- **Unadjusted analysis**: CD rates were higher in the US-EFW group (15.7% vs. 10.2%, P<0.001).  
- **Adjusted analysis**: US-EFW remained an independent risk factor for CD (odds ratio 1.44; 95% CI 1.1–1.9).  
- **Subgroup analysis**: The risk increased further when US-EFW exceeded 3500 g (OR 1.8; 95% CI 1.3–2.7).  
- The abstract explicitly states that "knowledge of US-EFW, above and beyond the impact of fetal size itself, increases the risk of CD," and concludes that US-EFW acquisition is an "independent and potentially modifiable risk factor."  

The study’s design (retrospective cohort) has limitations, but the adjusted analysis accounts for confounders, strengthening the conclusion. The term "modifiable" is supported because the decision to obtain or share US-EFW near term can be altered in clinical practice.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study provides evidence that knowledge of US-EFW, independent of fetal size, increases CD risk. Since the practice of obtaining or communicating US-EFW near term can be modified (e.g., avoiding late-term US-EFW or not sharing it with clinicians/patients), the answer is **yes**.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether knowledge of ultrasound-estimated fetal weight (US-EFW) is a **modifiable risk factor** for cesarean delivery (CD). Key elements include:  
- Whether US-EFW itself (not just fetal size) influences CD rates.  
- Whether this factor is "modifiable" (i.e., actionable through clinical decisions).  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study found significantly higher CD rates in women with US-EFW (15.7% vs. 10.2%, *P*<.001), even after adjusting for confounders (adjusted OR: 1.44).  
- Risk escalated with US-EFW >3500 g (OR: 1.8), suggesting a dose-response relationship.  
- The abstract explicitly concludes that **acquisition of US-EFW** (the act of performing/using the ultrasound) is an **independent and potentially modifiable risk factor**, distinct from fetal size.  
- While observational, the study controlled for confounders and demonstrated statistical significance, strengthening its reliability.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence supports that **knowledge of US-EFW itself** (independent of actual fetal size) increases CD risk. Since the decision to perform US-EFW near term is clinician-dependent, it qualifies as a **modifiable** factor. The study’s conclusions directly align with the question.
