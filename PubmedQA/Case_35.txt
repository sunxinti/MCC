Question: Can teaching medical students to investigate medication errors change their attitudes towards patient safety?

----- GPT's initial response -----
GPT is reasoning the answer...


**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content:** The primary inquiry is whether instructing medical students to investigate medication errors has an impact on their attitudes towards patient safety.
- **Key Information to Look For:** Evidence of attitude changes towards patient safety resulting from specific teaching methods focused on investigating medication errors.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results:** The study involved 108 medical students who underwent a patient-safety curriculum that included investigating medication errors using the Learning From Defects framework. The outcomes showed significant changes in attitudes towards patient safety as measured by the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire.
- **Strength and Reliability:** With a sample size of 108 students and all participating groups successfully completing the curriculum activities, the evidence appears robust. The use of a validated questionnaire (Safety Attitudes Questionnaire) adds to the reliability.
- **Relevance:** The evidence directly addresses the research question by linking the educational intervention (investigating medication errors) to measurable changes in attitudes toward patient safety.

**3. Conclusion**
The study provides clear scientific evidence that teaching medical students to investigate medication errors positively influences their attitudes towards patient safety.

**4. Final Answer**
**My final choice is: "yes"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether teaching medical students to investigate medication errors changes their attitudes toward patient safety. Key information to evaluate includes:  
- The study's intervention (curriculum components like online videos, faculty examples, and the Learning From Defects tool).  
- Measured outcomes (changes in patient safety attitudes via the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire).  
- Student feedback and study results.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The study reports:  
- **Significant changes** on questionnaire items related to patient safety attitudes.  
- All 25 student groups successfully identified and analyzed medication errors using the Learning From Defects framework.  
- The majority of students found the curriculum relevant and recommended its continuation.  
While the study lacks explicit details about a control group or long-term follow-up, the authors conclude that the curriculum "can change learners' attitudes toward patient safety," supported by statistically significant attitudinal shifts and positive student feedback. The evidence is relevant and directly addresses the question.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study demonstrates a clear, measurable improvement in medical students' attitudes toward patient safety after the intervention. Though methodological details (e.g., control group comparison) are limited in the abstract, the reported outcomes and student endorsement strongly suggest the curriculum was effective. The answer is "yes."  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**
Qwen selected: yes

DeepSeek is reasoning the answer...

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether teaching medical students to investigate medication errors can alter their attitudes toward patient safety. The key information to assess includes whether the study demonstrated attitudinal changes and whether the curriculum specifically involving error investigation contributed to these changes.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study implemented a curriculum where students analyzed medication errors using the Learning From Defects tool during clinical rotations.  
- Outcomes showed **significant changes** in patient safety attitudes, measured via validated Safety Attitudes Questionnaire items.  
- All student groups successfully identified and presented safety concerns, and the majority found the curriculum relevant and recommended its continuation.  
- The abstract explicitly states that the curriculum "changed learners' attitudes towards patient safety," directly linking the intervention to the outcome.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence strongly supports that the curriculum, which included investigating medication errors, led to measurable improvements in students' attitudes toward patient safety. The study design, use of validated tools, and consistent results across participants justify confidence in the conclusion.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**
DeepSeek selected: yes

Initial consensus: All models selected yes
