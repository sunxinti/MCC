Question: Should chest wall irradiation be included after mastectomy and negative node breast cancer?

**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content:** The central question investigates whether chest wall irradiation should be administered to patients who have undergone a mastectomy for breast cancer with negative lymph nodes.
- **Key Information to Look For:**
  - Effectiveness of chest wall irradiation in preventing local recurrence.
  - Specific patient subgroups that might benefit from irradiation (e.g., based on age or tumor size).
  - Statistical significance and reliability of the study findings.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results and Data:** The study retrospectively analyzed 92 node-negative breast cancer cases treated with post-mastectomy radiotherapy targeting the internal mammary chain. The local recurrence rate was low (5%), with recurrences occurring at the operative site and chest wall.
- **Strength and Reliability:** The study has a relatively small sample size and is retrospective in nature, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, factors like age ≤40 years and tumor size >20mm were associated with increased local failure, though these associations lacked statistical significance.
- **Relevance to the Question:** The evidence suggests that while overall local recurrence is low, certain subgroups may be at higher risk and could potentially benefit from chest wall irradiation. However, the lack of statistical significance in the identified risk factors indicates that more robust studies are needed to make definitive recommendations.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the analysis, chest wall irradiation may be beneficial for specific subsets of node-negative breast cancer patients, particularly those who are younger and have larger tumors. However, the evidence is not strong enough to universally recommend its inclusion for all node-negative patients.

**4. Final Answer**
**My final choice is: "maybe"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether chest wall irradiation should be included after mastectomy in patients with node-negative breast cancer. Key points to assess:  
- The study's findings on local recurrence patterns and risk factors.  
- Whether the evidence supports the inclusion of chest wall irradiation, particularly in specific subgroups.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Results**: The study found a 5% local recurrence rate (5/92 patients), with recurrences occurring in the mastectomy scar/chest wall. Risk factors were age ≤40 years and tumor size >20 mm, though not statistically significant.  
- **Study Design**: Retrospective analysis with a moderate sample size (92 patients) and limited statistical power, given the low recurrence rate.  
- **Relevance**: The study evaluates radiotherapy targeting the *internal mammary chain*, not the chest wall itself. However, recurrences were noted in the chest wall/scar, suggesting that standard post-mastectomy radiotherapy (including internal mammary chain) may not fully prevent chest wall failure. The abstract concludes that radiotherapy should be considered for high-risk subgroups (young age, large tumor), but the recommendation is cautious.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence suggests that chest wall irradiation (or broader radiotherapy coverage) might be warranted in high-risk patients (e.g., age ≤40, tumor size >20 mm), but the study’s limitations (retrospective design, non-statistically significant risk factors) and focus on internal mammary chain irradiation weaken the certainty. The conclusion leans toward a conditional recommendation ("maybe") rather than a definitive "yes" or "no."  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "maybe"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether chest wall irradiation should be included in post-mastectomy radiotherapy for node-negative breast cancer patients. Key information to evaluate includes recurrence patterns, risk factors, and the study's recommendations regarding radiotherapy in this population.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study retrospectively analyzed 92 node-negative patients who received internal mammary chain (IMC) irradiation (50 Gy) but **not chest wall irradiation**.  
- Local recurrences (5%) occurred specifically in the chest wall and surgical scar.  
- Risk factors (age ≤40 years, tumor size >20 mm) were associated with higher local failure rates, though statistical significance was not achieved.  
- The authors recommend discussing post-mastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) for high-risk subgroups but did not explicitly test chest wall irradiation in their protocol.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence indirectly suggests that chest wall irradiation *might* reduce recurrences in high-risk node-negative patients (e.g., younger age, larger tumors), as failures occurred in unirradiated chest wall sites. However, the study did not directly evaluate chest wall irradiation, and its retrospective design limits causal inference. The recommendation to "discuss" PMRT implies uncertainty, supporting a **"maybe"** answer.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: maybe**
