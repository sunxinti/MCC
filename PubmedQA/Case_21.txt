**1. Question Analysis**
The core question investigates whether flexible instruments are capable of creating femoral tunnel lengths greater than 20 mm when the knee is flexed at 90°, specifically in the context of Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Key information to look for includes the femoral tunnel lengths achieved at 90° flexion and the safety concerning nearby lateral structures.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
The study utilized ten fresh cadaveric knees to measure femoral tunnel lengths using a flexible reamer system at various knee flexion angles (70°, 90°, and 120°). At 90° of flexion, the mean intra-osseous length achieved was 32.1 mm, well above the 20 mm threshold. The statistical significance (p<0.05) indicates that these results are reliable. Additionally, the study found no significant differences concerning the safety of lateral structures (LCL and common peroneal nerve) at 90° flexion, suggesting that the technique is safe at this angle.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the evidence, flexible instruments successfully create femoral tunnel lengths exceeding 20 mm at 90° knee flexion without compromising the safety of critical lateral structures. The study's findings support the effectiveness and safety of using flexible instruments at this specific knee flexion angle in ACL reconstruction.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The core question is whether flexible instruments can create femoral tunnel lengths ≥20 mm at 90° knee flexion during ACL reconstruction, while ensuring safety regarding lateral structures (common peroneal nerve and LCL). Key data points to evaluate include tunnel length measurements at 90° flexion and distances to critical structures.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Tunnel Length**: The study reports a mean intra-osseous length of **32.1 mm (range 22–45 mm)** at 90° flexion, which exceeds the 20 mm threshold. This is statistically significant compared to 70° flexion (25.2 mm) and aligns with longer lengths at higher flexion angles.  
- **Safety**:  
  - **LCL Distance**: No significant differences in distance to the LCL across flexion angles, including 90°, indicating no increased risk of LCL injury.  
  - **Common Peroneal Nerve**: While distances trended longer with higher flexion (e.g., 120° vs. 70°), the abstract does not explicitly report distances at 90°. However, the conclusion states that "adequate femoral tunnel lengths can be safely created without knee hyperflexion," implying 90° flexion is safe.  

The study’s cadaveric design and statistical comparisons (p<0.05) suggest reliable evidence. The conclusion directly answers the question, affirming safety and adequacy at 90° without hyperflexion.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The data confirm that flexible instruments achieve tunnel lengths >20 mm at 90° flexion. Safety is supported by no LCL proximity issues and the study’s conclusion emphasizing safety without hyperflexion. Thus, the answer is **yes**.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether flexible instruments can create femoral tunnel lengths ≥20 mm at 90° knee flexion during ACL reconstruction while avoiding damage to lateral knee structures. Key information includes tunnel length measurements at 90° flexion and safety data (distances to the LCL and common peroneal nerve).  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Tunnel Lengths**: At 90° flexion, mean intra-osseous length was **32.1 mm** (range: 22–45 mm), exceeding the 20 mm threshold. Statistical significance (p<0.05) was noted compared to 70° flexion.  
- **Safety**: Distances to the LCL showed no significant differences across flexion angles. Distances to the common peroneal nerve increased with flexion (statistically significant at 120° vs. 70°).  
- **Study Design**: Cadaveric study with 10 specimens, direct measurements, and statistical analysis. Results support the feasibility and safety of the technique at 90° flexion without hyperflexion (≤120°).  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study demonstrates that femoral tunnels >20 mm are consistently achieved at 90° flexion (mean: 32.1 mm) with no safety concerns for lateral structures. The evidence directly supports the question’s premise.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: yes**
DeepSeek selected: yes
