Question: Are patients with Werlhof's disease at increased risk for bleeding complications when undergoing cardiac surgery?

**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content:** The question seeks to determine whether patients with Werlhof's disease (WD) have an increased risk of bleeding complications when undergoing cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation.
- **Key Information to Look For:** Comparative data on bleeding complications between WD patients and matched controls without WD, platelet counts, transfusion requirements, and any reported adverse outcomes related to bleeding.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Study Design:** A case-control study comparing 10 WD patients undergoing cardiac surgery with 50 matched controls.
- **Platelet Counts:** WD-group had significantly lower platelet counts preoperatively, which improved with immunoglobulin treatment.
- **Transfusion Requirements:** WD-group required more platelet transfusions (2.3 vs. 0.7 on average), indicating a higher transfusion need.
- **Bleeding Outcomes:** Total drainage loss was nearly identical between the groups (1197 ml vs. 1140 ml). Bleeding complications requiring re-exploration occurred in 10% of WD patients compared to 6% of controls, which is not a statistically significant difference.
- **Mortality:** Postoperative mortality was similar and unrelated to WD.
- **Reliability:** The study includes matched controls and statistical analysis of key outcomes, lending reliability to the findings. However, the sample size is relatively small, which may limit the generalizability.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the study, patients with Werlhof's disease did not exhibit a markedly increased risk of bleeding complications during cardiac surgery compared to matched controls, despite lower platelet counts and higher transfusion requirements. The similarity in drainage loss and bleeding complication rates supports the conclusion that WD does not significantly elevate bleeding risk in this context.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether patients with Werlhof's disease (WD) face an increased risk of bleeding complications during cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation. Key factors to evaluate include platelet counts, transfusion requirements, drainage volume, and re-exploration rates compared to matched controls.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Platelet Counts**: WD patients had significantly lower platelet counts pre- and post-immunoglobulin treatment, but drainage volume (a proxy for bleeding) was nearly identical between groups (1197 mL vs. 1140 mL).  
- **Bleeding Complications**: Only one patient in each group required re-exploration for bleeding, indicating no significant difference in complication rates.  
- **Transfusion Requirements**: WD patients received more platelet transfusions (2.3 vs. 0.7), but this reflects compensatory treatment rather than worsened bleeding outcomes.  
- **Mortality**: Postoperative mortality was similar and unrelated to WD.  
- **Study Limitations**: Small sample size (10 WD patients) introduces uncertainty, but the abstract emphasizes "no markedly enhanced risk" despite lower platelets.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study’s data show comparable bleeding complications (re-exploration rates and drainage) between WD and control groups. While WD patients required more transfusions due to lower platelet counts, the actual bleeding outcomes did not differ significantly. The abstract’s conclusion supports "no markedly enhanced risk," but the small sample size and phrasing like "may possibly" suggest some uncertainty.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether patients with Werlhof’s disease (WD) face an increased risk of bleeding complications during cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation. Key information to evaluate includes perioperative platelet counts, transfusion requirements, drainage loss, and bleeding-related outcomes (e.g., reexploration rates).

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Platelet Counts & Transfusions**: WD patients had significantly lower platelet counts perioperatively but received more platelet transfusions (2.3 vs. 0.7 units, *P=0.007*).  
- **Drainage Loss**: Total mediastinal chest tube drainage was comparable (1140 ml vs. 1197 ml, WD vs. controls).  
- **Bleeding Complications**: Both groups had one reexploration each for bleeding. Mortality rates were similar and unrelated to WD.  
- **Study Limitations**: Small sample size (10 WD patients) and retrospective design may limit generalizability, but matched controls strengthen internal validity.  

**3. Conclusion**  
Despite lower platelet counts and higher transfusion needs, WD patients did not experience significantly increased bleeding complications compared to controls. The authors conclude that WD does not confer a "markedly enhanced risk," though caution remains due to limited sample size. The evidence supports **"no"** for an increased risk of bleeding complications.

**My final choice is: no**
