Question: Is there a favorable subset of patients with prostate cancer who develop oligometastases?

**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content:** The question seeks to determine whether there exists a subgroup of prostate cancer patients with oligometastases (defined as having five or fewer metastatic lesions) who exhibit favorable outcomes.
- **Key Information to Identify:** The number of metastatic lesions in patients, survival rates associated with different numbers of lesions, and any statistical significance supporting the existence of a favorable subset.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results and Data:** The study analyzed 369 prostate cancer patients, identifying that those with ≤5 metastatic lesions had significantly better survival rates (73% at 5 years and 36% at 10 years) compared to those with >5 lesions (45% at 5 years and 18% at 10 years, p = 0.02). Additionally, metastasis-free survival and the interval to bone metastasis were superior in the ≤5 lesions group.
- **Strength and Reliability:** The study is retrospective with a substantial sample size and a long follow-up period (minimum 10 years). The statistical significance (p-values) supports the reliability of the findings.
- **Relevance to the Question:** Directly addresses whether a subgroup based on the number of metastatic lesions has different outcomes, providing clear evidence relevant to the question.

**3. Conclusion**
The evidence strongly suggests that prostate cancer patients with five or fewer metastatic lesions constitute a favorable subset with improved survival outcomes compared to those with more than five lesions.

**4. Final Answer**
**My final choice is: "yes"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether a subset of prostate cancer patients with oligometastases (≤5 metastatic lesions) has a favorable outcome compared to those with >5 lesions. Key information to evaluate includes survival rates, statistical significance, and the study's methodology.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study found that patients with ≤5 metastases had significantly better overall survival (73% vs. 45% at 5 years; 36% vs. 18% at 10 years; p=0.02).  
- Metastasis-free survival and the interval to metastasis development were also better in the ≤5 group (p=0.01 and p=0.02).  
- However, survival *after* metastasis diagnosis did not differ between groups (p=0.17 and p=0.27).  
- The statistical significance of survival differences (p=0.02) and the clear numerical优势 for ≤5 lesions suggest the evidence is strong and directly relevant to the question.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The data shows that patients with ≤5 metastatic lesions have significantly improved long-term survival compared to those with >5 lesions. The study’s statistical analysis supports the existence of a favorable subset (oligometastatic prostate cancer patients). Thus, the answer is "yes."  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**
Qwen selected: yes

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether a favorable subset of prostate cancer patients with oligometastases (≤5 lesions) exists, based on improved outcomes compared to those with >5 lesions. Key information includes survival rates, metastasis-free intervals, and statistical significance of differences between the two groups.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study found significantly higher 5- and 10-year survival rates for patients with ≤5 metastases (73%/36%) vs. >5 lesions (45%/18%) (*p* = 0.02).  
- Patients with ≤5 lesions also had superior metastasis-free survival and longer intervals to bone metastasis development (*p* = 0.01 and 0.02).  
- Survival after metastasis diagnosis did not differ between groups, suggesting the benefit arises earlier in the disease course.  
- The retrospective design and focus on bone metastases limit generalizability, but the statistical significance and alignment with oligometastasis theory strengthen the findings.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The data supports that patients with ≤5 metastatic lesions have better survival and delayed progression than those with >5 lesions, consistent with the oligometastatic hypothesis. While retrospective, the evidence strongly suggests a favorable subset exists.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: yes**
DeepSeek selected: yes

Initial consensus: All models selected yes
