Question: Is Bare-Metal Stent Implantation Still Justifiable in High Bleeding Risk Patients Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention?

----- GPT's initial response -----

**1. Question Analysis**

The core question is whether Bare-Metal Stent (BMS) implantation remains justifiable for patients with high bleeding risk (HBR) undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI). Key information to identify includes comparative outcomes between BMS and Drug-Eluting Stents (DES) in HBR patients, specifically regarding ischemic events, bleeding risks, and overall safety and efficacy.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**

The referenced study (PMID: 26965932) is a randomized, single-blinded trial comparing zotarolimus-eluting Endeavor Sprint stent (E-ZES) with BMS in 828 HBR patients undergoing PCI. The primary endpoint was the 12-month major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) rate. The results indicated that E-ZES had a significantly lower MACE rate (22.6%) compared to BMS (29%), driven by reductions in myocardial infarction and target vessel revascularization. Additionally, stent thrombosis was lower in the E-ZES group, and bleeding events were comparable between the two groups. The study appears robust with a sizable sample and clear endpoints, directly addressing the research question.

**3. Conclusion**

Based on the evidence, DES (specifically E-ZES) demonstrates superior efficacy and safety compared to BMS in HBR patients, with better cardiovascular outcomes and no increase in bleeding events. This suggests that BMS may no longer be the preferred option in this patient population.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether using bare-metal stents (BMS) in high bleeding risk (HBR) patients undergoing PCI is still justifiable, given concerns about long-term dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with drug-eluting stents (DES). The key information to evaluate is whether the study (ZEUS trial) shows superiority or non-inferiority of BMS or DES in terms of ischemic and bleeding outcomes in HBR patients.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Primary Endpoint (MACE at 12 months):** E-ZES (DES) had a lower MACE rate (22.6% vs. 29% in BMS; HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.57–0.98, p=0.033). This was driven by fewer myocardial infarctions (3.5% vs. 10.4%) and target vessel revascularizations (5.9% vs. 11.4%).  
- **Bleeding Events:** No significant difference between stent groups.  
- **Stent Thrombosis:** Significantly lower in the E-ZES group.  
- **Study Design:** Multinational, randomized, single-blinded trial with 828 HBR patients, using a 30-day abbreviated DAPT protocol.  

The results show that E-ZES (DES) outperformed BMS in reducing ischemic events without increasing bleeding risk in HBR patients. The trial’s design and sample size add credibility to these findings.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study provides strong evidence that DES (E-ZES) is superior to BMS in HBR patients, with lower MACE rates and comparable bleeding outcomes. Since DES reduces ischemic risks without increasing bleeding in this population, BMS appears less justifiable compared to DES under the trial’s protocol (shortened DAPT).

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether BMS implantation remains justifiable in HBR patients undergoing PCI, given concerns about bleeding risks and DAPT duration. Key information to evaluate includes comparative outcomes (ischemic/bleeding events) between E-ZES (a DES) and BMS in HBR patients using abbreviated DAPT (30 days).

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The ZEUS trial showed that E-ZES with 30-day DAPT significantly reduced 12-month MACE (22.6% vs. 29% for BMS), driven by lower myocardial infarction (3.5% vs. 10.4%) and target vessel revascularization (5.9% vs. 11.4%).  
- Stent thrombosis was reduced with E-ZES, and bleeding events were comparable between groups.  
- The study design (randomized, stratified, multinational) and statistically significant hazard ratio (HR: 0.75, p=0.033) support robust evidence.  
- The findings directly address the controversy of DES vs. BMS in HBR patients, demonstrating superior efficacy without increased bleeding risk.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence indicates that E-ZES with short DAPT provides better ischemic outcomes and similar bleeding risks compared to BMS in HBR patients. Since BMS did not demonstrate safety advantages and had worse efficacy, its justification in this population is weakened.
