**1. Question Analysis**

The core question is whether there is a quantitative change in left ventricular (LV) regional wall motion after fibrous tissue resection in patients with endomyocardial fibrosis. Key information to identify in the abstract includes:

- Measurement of LV regional wall motion pre- and post-surgery.
- Methodology for assessing wall motion (centerline method).
- Comparison of regional wall motion across specific LV segments.
- Statistical significance of any changes observed.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**

The study prospectively analyzed 30 patients with endomyocardial fibrosis before and after fibrous tissue resection surgery. The primary findings related to the question are:

- **LV Regional Wall Motion:** The study measured wall motion in five LV segments using the centerline method and expressed abnormalities in units of standard deviation from the normal mean. The results indicated that there was no significant difference in LV regional wall motion between preoperative and postoperative measurements.
  
- **Ejection Fraction:** Similarly, the global left ventricular ejection fraction remained unchanged post-surgery (0.45±0.13% preoperative vs. 0.43±0.12% postoperative).
  
- **Clinical Outcomes:** Despite the lack of change in wall motion and ejection fraction, there was a significant improvement in the New York Heart Association functional class postoperatively, suggesting improved clinical symptoms.

The evidence is reliable as it involves a prospective study with a clear methodology and statistical analysis. However, the sample size is relatively small (30 patients), which may affect the generalizability of the results.

**3. Conclusion**

Based on the study's findings, quantitative left ventricular regional wall motion does not change after fibrous tissue resection in endomyocardial fibrosis patients, despite improvements in clinical symptoms. Therefore, the answer to the research question is supported by the evidence presented.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether quantitative left ventricular regional wall motion improves after fibrous tissue resection in endomyocardial fibrosis (EMF). Key information to assess includes pre- and postoperative measurements of regional wall motion, the study's methodology, and statistical significance of changes.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The abstract states that regional left ventricular motion was measured in five segments using the centerline method. The results explicitly mention:  
- "Left ventricular wall motion in the five regions did not differ between pre- and postoperative measurements."  
- Global left ventricular ejection fraction also remained unchanged (0.45% vs. 0.43%, respectively).  
- Clinical improvement (NYHA class) occurred but was not linked to changes in regional wall motion.  

The study’s design (prospective, 30 patients) and methods (standardized measurements) suggest reliable evidence. The lack of difference in regional wall motion is directly addressed, and no subgroup analysis or confounding factors are mentioned that would weaken the conclusion.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The abstract provides clear evidence that regional wall motion did not change post-surgery. The clinical improvement (NYHA class) is attributed to factors other than regional wall motion or global EF, as stated in the abstract’s conclusion. Thus, the answer is "no."  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "no"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether quantitative left ventricular (LV) regional wall motion improves after fibrous tissue resection in endomyocardial fibrosis (EMF). Key information to evaluate includes preoperative vs. postoperative measurements of regional wall motion and LV ejection fraction (LVEF), as well as clinical outcomes (NYHA class).

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study prospectively assessed 30 EMF patients pre- and postoperatively.  
- Regional LV wall motion (measured via the centerline method in 5 segments) showed **no significant difference** pre- vs. post-surgery.  
- LVEF remained unchanged (0.45 ± 0.13% pre-op vs. 0.43 ± 0.12% post-op).  
- Despite no improvement in wall motion or LVEF, NYHA functional class improved significantly (83% to class I/II post-op).  
- The authors conclude that clinical improvement likely stems from mechanisms unrelated to systolic function (e.g., diastolic function).  

The evidence is robust: standardized methods (centerline, area-length), prospective design, and statistically supported clinical outcomes. The data directly addresses the question and shows no postoperative change in regional wall motion.

**3. Conclusion**  
The study explicitly states that regional LV wall motion and LVEF did not change postoperatively, despite symptomatic improvement. Thus, the answer is **"no"**, as resection of fibrous tissue does not alter quantitative LV regional wall motion in EMF patients.

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: no**
DeepSeek selected: no
