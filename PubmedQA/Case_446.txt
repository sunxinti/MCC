**1. Question Analysis**

The core question is whether calprotectin can predict the risk of relapse in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Key information to look for includes the effectiveness of calprotectin as a predictive marker, the specific types of IBD it applies to (e.g., ulcerative colitis vs. Crohn's disease), the statistical significance of the findings, and the reliability of the study results.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**

The study included 97 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 65 with Crohn's disease (CD) in clinical remission. For UC patients, a positive calprotectin test was significantly associated with a higher relapse rate (26 out of 44) compared to those with a negative test (11 out of 53), with a P-value of 0.000, indicating strong statistical significance. In CD patients, the overall correlation was not significant; however, among those with colonic CD, a positive calprotectin test was significantly associated with relapse (4 out of 6, P=0.02). The study's prospective design and the use of appropriate statistical analyses enhance the reliability of the evidence.

**3. Conclusion**

Based on the evidence, calprotectin is a reliable predictor of relapse risk in patients with ulcerative colitis and those with colonic Crohn's disease. However, its predictive value may not extend to all forms of Crohn's disease. Therefore, while it is effective in specific subgroups within IBD, its generalizability to all IBD patients is limited.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether calprotectin can predict relapse risk in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Key information to evaluate includes:  
- The study’s design (prospective cohort), patient groups (UC vs. CD), calprotectin cutoff (130 mg/kg), relapse rates in positive vs. negative groups, and statistical significance.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **UC Patients**: Among 97 UC patients in remission, those with a positive calprotectin test (≥130 mg/kg) had a significantly higher relapse rate (26/44 relapsed) compared to those with a negative test (11/53 relapsed; *P = 0.000*). This strong statistical significance supports calprotectin’s predictive value in UC.  
- **CD Patients**: Overall CD results were not significant, but **colonic CD** (a subset of CD) showed a significant correlation (4/6 relapsed with positive calprotectin; *P = 0.02*). Non-colonic CD did not show a significant association.  
- The study’s conclusion explicitly states calprotectin helps identify UC and colonic CD patients at higher relapse risk.  

**3. Conclusion**  
Calprotectin predicts relapse risk in **UC patients** and **colonic CD patients**, but not in all CD patients. Since the question refers to IBD broadly (which includes UC and CD), the answer depends on the subset. The abstract confirms calprotectin’s utility in specific IBD subgroups, so the answer is **yes**, as the question does not restrict to all IBD patients universally.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether calprotectin can predict relapse risk in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Key information to identify includes the study's findings on the correlation between calprotectin levels and relapse rates in IBD subtypes (ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn's disease [CD]).

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **UC Patients**: A significant correlation was observed between positive calprotectin tests (≥130 mg/kg) and relapse risk (26/44 relapsed vs. 11/53 with negative tests; *P* = 0.000).  
- **CD Patients**: Only colonic CD showed a significant correlation (4/6 relapsed with positive tests vs. 7/35 with negative tests; *P* = 0.02), while no significant association was found for non-colonic CD.  
- The study prospectively followed patients for 1 year, used Kaplan-Meier analysis, and reported statistically robust results (log-rank test). However, the predictive utility is limited to UC and colonic CD, not all IBD subtypes.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence supports calprotectin as a predictor of relapse in UC and colonic CD, but not universally across all IBD (e.g., non-colonic CD). Since the question broadly refers to IBD, the answer is **"yes"** with the caveat that predictive utility is subtype-specific.
