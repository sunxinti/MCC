**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content:** The research question investigates whether evaluating the bactericidal activity of three antiseptic solutions (chlorhexidine-benzalkonium [CB], hexamidine-chlorhexidine-chlorocresol [HCC], and povidone iodine [P]) in the presence of interfering substances can lead to an improvement of the NF EN 13727 European Standard for assessing antiseptics used on skin and mucous membranes.
- **Key Information to Look For:** 
  - How the study adapted the NF EN 13727 standard.
  - The bactericidal effectiveness of each antiseptic under the new conditions.
  - Whether the adaptations provided a more accurate or reliable assessment relevant to clinical practice.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results and Data:** 
  - Only the CB combination demonstrated consistent bactericidal activity across all tested concentrations and bacterial strains in the presence of interfering substances.
  - HCC and P showed limited or no bactericidal activity under the same conditions.
- **Strength and Reliability:** The study systematically adapted the existing standard and tested multiple antiseptics under controlled in vitro conditions, providing clear comparative data.
- **Relevance to the Question:** The findings indicate that the adapted protocol can effectively differentiate the efficacy of antiseptics in "dirty" conditions, suggesting that the NF EN 13727 standard can be improved by incorporating such modifications.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the abstract, the study successfully adapted the NF EN 13727 standard to better evaluate antiseptics in the presence of interfering substances. The reliable differentiation in bactericidal activity, particularly highlighting the efficacy of CB in practical conditions, supports the notion that these adaptations improve the standard.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether the study (PMID: 25779009) supports an improvement of the NF EN 13727 European Standard for evaluating antiseptics in the presence of interfering substances. The key focus is whether the adapted protocol (dilutions, solvent, interfering substances) provides a better method than the original standard.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study adapted the NF EN 13727 standard by introducing interfering substances and testing diluted antiseptic concentrations (1%, 10%, 50%, and 97%).  
- Results showed that only the chlorhexidine-benzalkonium (CB) solution met the bactericidal requirement (≥5 log reduction in 60 seconds) across most tested bacteria and concentrations, including in "dirty" conditions (with interfering substances).  
- Other antiseptics (HCC and P) failed to meet standards under certain conditions (e.g., HCC lacked activity except on P. aeruginosa; P failed against E. hirae and S. aureus).  
- The abstract explicitly states that adapting the standard allowed assessment of antiseptics "in current practice conditions," particularly for use on skin/mucous membranes in gynecology/dermatology.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The adaptation improved the standard by incorporating interfering substances and diluted concentrations, which better mimic real-world clinical conditions. The results demonstrated that only CB performed effectively under these conditions, highlighting the adapted method's utility in evaluating antiseptic efficacy in practical scenarios. This suggests the adaptation is a meaningful improvement over the original standard.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether adapting the NF EN 13727 standard improved the evaluation of bactericidal activity for three antiseptic solutions (CB, HCC, P) in the presence of interfering substances. Key points include:  
- Whether the adapted protocol effectively assessed bactericidal activity under "dirty conditions" (with interfering substances).  
- Whether the results validated the antiseptic solutions' efficacy per the standard's requirements (≥5 log reduction after 60 seconds).  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study adapted the NF EN 13727 standard by modifying dilutions, solvents, and interfering substances to mimic real-world clinical use.  
- Results showed:  
  - **HCC** was only bactericidal against *P. aeruginosa* at 97% concentration.  
  - **P** failed against *E. hirae* at all concentrations and *S. aureus* at 97%.  
  - **CB** achieved >5 log reduction on all four bacterial strains at 97%, 50%, and 10% concentrations, meeting bactericidal criteria in dirty conditions.  
- The abstract concludes that the adapted standard successfully identified CB as effective, demonstrating its utility for validating antiseptic choices in clinical practice.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The adapted protocol allowed differentiation between antiseptics, confirming CB's efficacy while exposing HCC and P's limitations. This validates the adaptation as an improvement to the standard for real-world conditions.
