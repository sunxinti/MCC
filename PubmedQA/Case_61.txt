Question: Preoperative tracheobronchoscopy in newborns with esophageal atresia: does it matter?

----- GPT's initial response -----
GPT is reasoning the answer...


**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content**: The primary question investigates whether preoperative tracheobronchoscopy (TBS) significantly impacts outcomes in newborns with esophageal atresia (EA).
- **Key Information to Look For**:
  - The effectiveness of TBS in preventing complications.
  - The role of TBS in improving diagnosis and surgical treatment.
  - Data on how often TBS influenced surgical decisions.
  - Safety and reliability of the TBS procedure in this patient population.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results and Data**:
  - In a study of 62 newborns with EA, preoperative TBS was used.
  - TBS was clinically useful in 28 patients (45.2%).
  - In 15 patients (24.2%), TBS was crucial in modifying the surgical approach.
  - TBS identified previously undetected malformations in 4 patients.
  - No complications from the TBS procedure were observed.
- **Strength and Reliability**:
  - The study includes a reasonable sample size (62 patients) over a 6-year period.
  - The findings indicate a significant proportion of cases where TBS influenced clinical decisions.
  - The absence of complications suggests the procedure is safe.
- **Relevance to the Question**:
  - The evidence directly addresses the utility of TBS in preoperative settings for EA, demonstrating both diagnostic and surgical benefits.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the provided abstract, preoperative tracheobronchoscopy appears to play a significant role in improving surgical outcomes and diagnosing associated anomalies in newborns with esophageal atresia. The procedure was both safe and effective in nearly half of the cases, with a substantial subset where it was crucial for modifying the surgical approach.

**4. Final Answer**
**My final choice is: "yes"**
GPT selected: yes

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether preoperative tracheobronchoscopy (TBS) matters in newborns with esophageal atresia (EA) regarding preventing complications, improving diagnosis, or surgical outcomes. Key points to evaluate include:  
- Whether TBS altered surgical management.  
- Whether TBS identified undetected anomalies.  
- Whether complications from TBS occurred.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The abstract reports:  
- **Diagnostic Utility**: TBS reclassified 3/9 patients initially diagnosed as type A EA to type B due to unsuspected proximal fistulas. It also detected respiratory anomalies (e.g., aberrant bronchi, hypoplastic bronchi) in 4 patients and carinal fistulas in 14 patients.  
- **Surgical Impact**: TBS modified the surgical approach in 24.2% (15/62) of cases (e.g., cervical approach for H-type or type B fistulas).  
- **Safety**: No complications were observed.  
- **Conclusion**: The authors explicitly state TBS is "useful and safe" and recommend it in tertiary centers.  

The study’s data show TBS had a clinically significant impact on diagnosis and surgical planning (affecting 45% of patients) without complications. While the study is retrospective and from a single center, the observed benefits directly address the question’s concerns.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence strongly supports that preoperative TBS matters in EA cases. It improved diagnostic accuracy, altered surgical strategies in a meaningful subset of patients, and was complication-free. The study’s conclusions align with the findings, reinforcing the recommendation for its use.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether preoperative tracheobronchoscopy (TBS) in newborns with esophageal atresia (EA) improves diagnosis, surgical treatment, or prevents complications. Key points to evaluate include changes in surgical approach, detection of missed anomalies, and safety outcomes.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study (n=62) found preoperative TBS altered the Gross classification in 3/9 type A EA patients (revealing proximal fistulas, changing them to type B) and identified 2 H-type fistulas.  
- TBS detected respiratory malformations (e.g., aberrant bronchi) in 4 patients and guided Fogarty catheter occlusion of carinal fistulas in 14 patients, improving intraoperative ventilation.  
- TBS directly modified the surgical approach in 15/62 (24.2%) patients (e.g., cervical repair for proximal/H-type fistulas) and was deemed clinically useful in 45.2% of cases.  
- No complications were reported, supporting safety.  
- Limitations include the absence of a control group and potential selection bias, but the data demonstrates diagnostic and therapeutic utility.

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence indicates preoperative TBS improves diagnostic accuracy, identifies critical anomalies, and modifies surgical management in a significant proportion of EA cases without complications. While stronger comparative studies are needed, the findings support its clinical value.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**
DeepSeek selected: yes

Initial consensus: All models selected yes
