Question: Convulsions and retinal haemorrhage: should we look further?

----- GPT's initial response -----
GPT is reasoning the answer...


**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content**: The question seeks to determine whether retinal hemorrhages observed after convulsions warrant further investigation into potential underlying causes, such as child abuse.
- **Key Information**: The prevalence of retinal hemorrhages post-convulsions, their association with child abuse, and the outcomes of the study involving retinal examinations after convulsive episodes.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results**: In a prospective study of 153 children aged 2 months to 2 years presenting with convulsions, only one child exhibited unilateral retinal hemorrhages following a simple febrile convulsion. Further investigation in this case revealed no other underlying reason for the hemorrhage.
- **Strength and Reliability**: The study provides empirical data from a sizable sample in an emergency department setting. However, the occurrence of retinal hemorrhages was rare (1 out of 153), which may limit the generalizability of the findings.
- **Relevance**: The evidence directly addresses the relationship between convulsions and retinal hemorrhages and supports the notion that such findings are significant enough to prompt further investigation.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the study, retinal hemorrhages following convulsions are uncommon but significant findings. Even though only one case was identified without an alternative cause in this particular study, the association with child abuse necessitates thorough investigation when such hemorrhages are present.

**4. Final Answer**
**My final choice is: "yes"**
GPT selected: yes

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether the presence of retinal hemorrhages in children with convulsions should prompt further investigation (e.g., for systemic disorders or child abuse). The key information from the abstract includes:  
- Retinal hemorrhages are considered characteristic of child abuse.  
- A prospective study of 153 children found only 1 case of unilateral retinal hemorrhage after a simple febrile convulsion.  
- Further investigations in that case found no other cause.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Study Results**: The study found retinal hemorrhages to be rare (1/153 cases) after convulsions. Even in this rare case, no systemic disorder or abuse was identified despite thorough investigation.  
- **Strength/Reliability**: The prospective design and ophthalmologist-performed exams add credibility. However, the small number of cases (only 1 positive) limits generalizability.  
- **Relevance**: The study directly addresses the question by linking retinal hemorrhages to convulsions and advocating for further investigation due to rarity.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The abstract concludes that retinal hemorrhages post-convulsion are rare and should trigger an extensive search for other causes (including abuse). Even though the single case had no identified cause, the rarity itself justifies further investigation. Thus, the answer aligns with the study’s conclusion.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**
Qwen selected: yes

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether retinal hemorrhage observed after convulsions should prompt further investigation, particularly to rule out systemic disorders or child abuse. Key information to evaluate includes the prevalence of retinal hemorrhages post-convulsions and the study's recommendations regarding clinical follow-up.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The study prospectively examined 153 children (2 months–2 years) after convulsive episodes. Only **1 child** (0.65%) had unilateral retinal hemorrhages following a simple febrile convulsion, with no other identifiable cause despite thorough investigation. The abstract concludes that retinal hemorrhages after convulsions are rare but emphasizes that their presence should trigger an extensive evaluation for systemic disorders or abuse. The evidence is methodologically robust (prospective design, ophthalmologist-confirmed findings) but limited by the low prevalence (n=1), reducing statistical power to definitively exclude convulsions as a sole cause.

**3. Conclusion**  
The study explicitly recommends further investigation for retinal hemorrhages post-convulsions, even though they are rare. The single unexplained case underscores the need to rule out abuse or systemic conditions. Thus, the answer is **"yes"**—retinal hemorrhage should prompt additional evaluation.

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: yes**
DeepSeek selected: yes

Initial consensus: All models selected yes
