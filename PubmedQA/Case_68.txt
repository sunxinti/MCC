Question: Multidisciplinary decisions in breast cancer: does the patient receive what the team has recommended?

----- GPT's initial response -----
GPT is reasoning the answer...


**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content**: The research question seeks to determine whether patients with breast cancer receive the treatment recommendations made by a multidisciplinary team (MDT).
- **Key Information to Identify**: The proportion of MDT decisions that are implemented ("concordant") versus those that are not ("discordant"), including reasons for any discrepancies.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results and Data**:
  - **Concordant Decisions**: 91.5% of MDT recommendations were followed.
  - **Discordant Decisions**: 4.5% were not followed, with 17.8% of these being 'unjustifiable'.
  - **Reasons for Discordance**: Mainly patient choice or additional information post-MDT.
- **Strength and Reliability**: The large sample size (3230 MDT decisions) over a two-year period enhances the reliability of the findings.
- **Relevance**: The data directly addresses whether MDT recommendations are implemented in patient management.

**3. Conclusion**
The evidence indicates that a significant majority (over 90%) of MDT recommendations are implemented in patient care. Although there is a small percentage of discordant decisions, the primary reasons for these discrepancies are justifiable, such as patient choice or new information.

**4. Final Answer**
**My final choice is: "yes"**
GPT selected: yes

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether patients with breast cancer receive the treatment recommended by the multidisciplinary team (MDT). Key information to identify includes the concordance rate between MDT recommendations and actual patient management, reasons for discordance, and whether discordance is justified or unjustified.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Concordance Rate**: 91.5% of MDT decisions were implemented ("concordant").  
- **Discordance Rate**: 4.5% were discordant. Of these:  
  - 17.8% (26/146) were "unjustifiable" (no new information to explain the change).  
  - 82.2% (120/146) were "justifiable" due to patient choice (41.8% of discordant cases), new information (37.7%), or MDT error (3.4%).  
- The study highlights that most discordant decisions had valid reasons (e.g., patient preference or new data), while only a small fraction (0.8% of total decisions) were unjustifiable.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The vast majority (91.5%) of MDT recommendations were followed. While discordance occurred in 4.5% of cases, most of these were justifiable (e.g., patient choice or new information). Only a small minority (unjustifiable discordance: ~0.8% of total decisions) represented deviations without valid reasons. Since the question asks if patients "receive what the team recommended," the high concordance rate and the legitimacy of most discordant changes support a **yes** answer.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**
Qwen selected: yes

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether breast cancer patients receive the treatment recommended by the multidisciplinary team (MDT). Key information includes the concordance rate between MDT decisions and actual patient management, reasons for discordance, and the proportion of unjustified deviations.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study analyzed 3,230 MDT decisions for 705 patients.  
- **91.5% (2,956/3,230)** of decisions were concordant (implemented as recommended).  
- Discordance occurred in **4.5% (146/3,230)**, with **17.8% (26/146)** of these being "unjustifiable" (no new information post-MDT).  
- Justifiable discordance (82.2% of cases) stemmed from patient choice (61), additional post-MDT information (54), or MDT error (5).  
- The evidence is robust, with clear categorization of discordance reasons, supporting high implementation rates.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The data show that the **vast majority (91.5%) of MDT recommendations are implemented**, and most discordance is justifiable. Thus, the answer is **"yes"**, as patients overwhelmingly receive MDT-recommended care.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: yes**
DeepSeek selected: yes

Initial consensus: All models selected yes
