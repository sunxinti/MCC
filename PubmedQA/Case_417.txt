Question: Attaining negative margins in breast-conservation operations: is there a consensus among breast surgeons?

**1. Question Analysis**
The core question seeks to determine whether there is a consensus among breast surgeons regarding the attainment of negative (tumor-free) margins in breast-conservation operations for breast cancer treatment. Key information to look for includes variations in surgical practices, consistency in defining acceptable margins, and the presence or absence of standardized protocols among surgeons.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
The survey sent to 1,000 surgeons received 351 usable responses, indicating a response rate of 38%. The results revealed significant variability in surgical practices:
- Only 48% of surgeons examined margins grossly with a pathologist.
- A minority used frozen sections or imprint cytology for intraoperative margin analysis.
- Decisions to reexcise margins varied, with 57% never reexcising positive deep margins and 53% always reexcising positive anterior margins.
- There was a wide range in acceptable margin sizes: 15% accepted any negative margin, 28% accepted a 1-mm margin, 50% accepted a 2-mm margin, 12% accepted a 5-mm margin, and 3% accepted a 10-mm margin.
The abstract concludes that there is no prevailing standard of care and highlights the controversy and variability in practice patterns, indicating a lack of consensus.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the survey results, there is clear evidence of varied practices and a lack of uniformity among breast surgeons in attaining negative margins during breast-conservation operations. This variability suggests that no consensus exists within the surgical community on this issue.

**4. Final Answer**
**My final choice is: "no"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether there is a consensus among breast surgeons regarding the practices for attaining negative (tumor-free) surgical margins during breast-conservation operations. The key information to assess includes the consistency of surgical practices, margin assessment methods, and definitions of acceptable margins (e.g., margin width) among surveyed surgeons.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The abstract reports a survey of 351 breast surgeons, revealing significant variability in clinical practices:  
- Only 48% examine margins grossly with a pathologist, and fewer use frozen sections or cytology.  
- Decisions to reexcise margins differ widely (e.g., 57% never reexcise for a positive deep margin vs. 53% always reexcise for a positive anterior margin).  
- Acceptable margin widths vary dramatically: 15% accept any negative margin, 28% a 1-mm margin, 50% a 2-mm margin, and smaller subsets accept larger margins.  
The abstract explicitly states that "no prevailing standard of care" exists and that "additional study is needed" due to the lack of consensus. The surveyâ€™s large sample size (351 respondents) and direct focus on practice patterns strengthen the reliability of these conclusions.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence clearly demonstrates that breast surgeons in the U.S. exhibit significant discrepancies in their approaches to margin assessment, reexcision criteria, and acceptable margin widths. The study explicitly concludes that no consensus exists, supporting a "no" answer.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "no"**
Qwen selected: no

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether a consensus exists among breast surgeons regarding surgical practices for attaining negative margins in breast-conservation operations. Key information to assess includes survey results on intraoperative margin evaluation, reexcision decisions, and acceptable margin widths for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive carcinoma.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The abstract reveals significant variability:  
- Intraoperative margin assessment methods (e.g., gross examination, frozen sections) were inconsistently used.  
- Reexcision practices varied widely (e.g., 57% never reexcise a positive deep margin vs. 53% always reexcising a positive anterior margin).  
- Acceptable margin widths for DCIS/invasive carcinoma lacked agreement: responses ranged from "any negative margin" (15%) to 10 mm (3%), with no majority (50% favored 2 mm, but others diverged).  
- The authors explicitly state there is "no prevailing standard of care" and emphasize controversy in practice patterns.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The data demonstrates substantial heterogeneity in surgical practices and margin definitions, with no clear majority agreement. The authors conclude no consensus exists, directly aligning with the evidence.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: no**
DeepSeek selected: no

Initial consensus: All models selected no
