Question: Is there a need for pelvic CT scan in cases of renal cell carcinoma?

**1. Question Analysis**
The core question is whether pelvic CT scans are necessary for patients diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Key information to consider includes the prevalence of pelvic abnormalities detected via CT scans in RCC patients and whether these findings provide additional clinically significant information beyond other diagnostic methods.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
The study reviewed 400 RCC patients who underwent both ultrasonograms (USG) and contrast-enhanced CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis. Pelvic CT revealed abnormalities in 3.5% of cases, but all such abnormalities were already identified through other investigations like USG or plain X-ray. Specifically, among the malignant findings detected by pelvic CT, none provided new actionable information that wasn't already available through less invasive or less costly methods. The evidence suggests that pelvic CT scans rarely contribute additional diagnostic value in the management of RCC.

**3. Conclusion**
Given that pelvic CT scans did not identify any additional significant abnormalities beyond what was already detected by USG or plain X-rays in the vast majority of cases, the routine use of pelvic CT in RCC patients may not be justified. Therefore, pelvic CT scans should be reserved for selective cases where clinical indications warrant their use.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether a pelvic CT scan is necessary for patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Key information to evaluate includes the study's findings on the utility of pelvic CT in detecting clinically relevant abnormalities in the pelvis, the overlap with other diagnostic tests (e.g., ultrasound, X-ray), and the study's conclusions on cost-effectiveness and clinical necessity.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Results**: In 400 RCC patients, pelvic CT detected abnormalities in only 14 (3.5%). Of these, 6 (1.5%) were categorized as malignant (e.g., bladder cancer, RCC in a pelvic kidney, bone metastases). However, **all abnormalities were already identified by other pre-CT imaging (USG or plain X-ray)** before the pelvic CT.  
- **Strength**: The study includes a large sample size (n=400) and clearly categorizes pelvic findings. The conclusion that pelvic CT adds no new information is strongly supported by the data.  
- **Relevance**: The question directly aligns with the study's objective (evaluating necessity of pelvic CT in RCC). The key limitation is the study's timeframe (1988–2001), but imaging techniques for RCC staging have not fundamentally changed in terms of pelvic CT's role.  

**3. Conclusion**  
Since all pelvic abnormalities detected by CT were already identified by prior tests (USG/X-ray) and pelvic CT provided no additional clinically significant information in the vast majority of cases, the evidence strongly supports that routine pelvic CT is unnecessary. The study explicitly states pelvic CT should be performed "selectively," further justifying a "no" answer.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether pelvic CT scans are necessary for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients. The key focus is whether pelvic CT provides additional diagnostic value beyond other pre-operative imaging (e.g., ultrasound, abdominal CT, or X-ray) in detecting clinically significant pelvic abnormalities.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study reviewed 400 RCC patients who underwent pelvic CT alongside other imaging.  
- Pelvic CT detected abnormalities in 14 patients (3.5%), but **all** were already identified by prior investigations (ultrasound/X-ray).  
- Of the 6 patients with malignant pelvic findings (1.5%), diagnoses included bladder cancer, pelvic kidney RCC, and bone metastases—all detected pre-CT.  
- The authors conclude pelvic CT rarely adds unique information and recommend selective use to reduce imaging costs.  

The evidence is robust: a large sample size, clear methodology, and explicit results showing no unique pelvic CT findings. Reliability is strengthened by the absence of missed diagnoses when pelvic CT was omitted.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The data strongly indicate pelvic CT does not provide additional diagnostic value in RCC staging when combined with standard imaging (ultrasound, abdominal CT, X-ray). Routine pelvic CT is unnecessary, though selective use in specific clinical scenarios (e.g., suspected pelvic metastases) may still apply.
