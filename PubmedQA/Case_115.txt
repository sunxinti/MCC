**1. Question Analysis**
The research question seeks to determine whether the Obsessive-Compulsive (O-C) dimension of the Symptom Checklist 90-R (SCL 90-R) can identify cognitive impairments in individuals with brain tumors. Key information to look for includes the relationship between the O-C scores and objective cognitive measures (like attention and verbal memory) versus their relationship with emotional symptoms (such as depression and anxiety).

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
The study involved 19 adults with malignant brain tumors who were assessed using various neuropsychological tests alongside the SCL 90-R. The findings indicate that the SCL 90-R O-C subscale was **not** related to objective measures of attention, verbal memory, or age. Instead, it showed significant correlations with symptoms of depression (r = .81), anxiety (r = .66), and subjective complaints of memory problems (r = .75). Additionally, multivariate analyses revealed that depression symptoms accounted for 66% of the variance in O-C scores, while anxiety contributed an additional 6%.

The strength of this evidence lies in its clear distinction between emotional symptoms and objective cognitive measures, demonstrating that the O-C dimension is more closely tied to emotional distress rather than direct cognitive impairments.

**3. Conclusion**
The evidence suggests that the SCL 90-R O-C dimension does not effectively identify objective cognitive impairments in individuals with brain tumors. Instead, it primarily reflects emotional distress, particularly symptoms of depression and anxiety.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether the SCL-90-R obsessive-compulsive subscale identifies cognitive impairments. Key information to assess includes:  
- Whether the SCL-90-R obsessive-compulsive dimension correlated with objective cognitive measures (e.g., attention, verbal memory).  
- The study's conclusion regarding the SCL-90-R's role in assessing cognition versus emotional distress.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The abstract states:  
- The SCL-90-R Obsessive-Compulsive subscale was **not related** to **objective measures of attention, verbal memory, or age**.  
- It was significantly correlated with **depression (r = 0.81)**, **anxiety (r = 0.66)**, and **subjective memory complaints (r = 0.75)**.  
- Multivariate analysis showed that **66% of the variance in SCL-90-R scores was explained by depression**, with anxiety contributing an additional 6%.  
- The authors conclude the SCL-90-R is best viewed as an **indicator of unidimensional emotional distress**, not cognitive impairment.  

The evidence is strong and directly addresses the question. The study used objective neuropsychological tests and statistically ruled out cognitive correlates while emphasizing emotional distress as the primary driver of SCL-90-R scores.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The SCL-90-R obsessive-compulsive dimension does **not** identify cognitive impairments. It correlates strongly with emotional symptoms (depression, anxiety) and subjective complaints but lacks objective cognitive correlates. The study explicitly states the scale reflects emotional distress, not cognition.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "no"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether the SCL 90-R Obsessive-Compulsive (OC) subscale identifies cognitive impairments in individuals with brain tumors. Key information to evaluate includes the relationship between the OC subscale and objective cognitive measures (e.g., attention, verbal memory) versus its association with emotional/somatic factors.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study explicitly states the OC subscale was **not related to objective cognitive measures** (attention, verbal memory) but correlated strongly with **depression**, **anxiety**, and **subjective memory complaints**.  
- Multivariate analysis showed depression and anxiety accounted for 72% of the variance in OC scores, while objective cognitive measures contributed no significant variance.  
- The abstract concludes the SCL 90-R reflects **emotional distress and somatic effects** rather than cognitive deficits.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence robustly demonstrates that the OC subscale does not identify objective cognitive impairments but instead reflects psychological distress. Thus, the answer is **"no"**.

**My final choice is: no**
