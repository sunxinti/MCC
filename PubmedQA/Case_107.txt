**1. Question Analysis**
The core question is whether radiotherapy (RT) administered around the time of pregnancy for Hodgkin's disease affects the subsequent risk of developing breast cancer. Key information to identify includes:
- Comparison between pregnant and nonpregnant women receiving RT.
- Incidence rates of breast cancer in both groups.
- Statistical significance of the findings.
- Consideration of confounding factors through multivariate analysis.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
The study reviewed 382 women treated with RT for Hodgkin's disease, comparing those treated around the time of pregnancy with those who were not pregnant. Key findings include:
- A significantly higher overall incidence of breast cancer in the pregnant group (16.0% vs. 2.3%, p = 0.0001).
- The actuarial rate of breast cancer was significantly higher in the pregnant group (p = 0.011).
- Multivariate analysis identified pregnancy around the time of RT as the only variable associated with increased breast cancer risk, with a hazard ratio of 22.49 (95% CI: 5.56-90.88; p < 0.001).
- The study's strengths include statistical significance and the use of multivariate analysis to control for confounders.
- However, limitations such as a small sample size (382 women with only 14 developing breast cancer) and limited follow-up time may affect the reliability and generalizability of the results.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the abstract, the evidence suggests a strong association between RT around the time of pregnancy and an increased risk of breast cancer. Despite the study's limitations, the statistical significance and the magnitude of the hazard ratio support the conclusion that RT during this sensitive period may modify breast cancer risk.

**4. Final Answer**
**My final choice is: "yes"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether radiotherapy (RT) administered around the time of pregnancy for Hodgkin's disease alters the risk of developing breast cancer. Key information to evaluate includes:  
- Comparison of breast cancer incidence between pregnant and nonpregnant groups.  
- Statistical significance of differences in actuarial rates and latency.  
- Multivariate analysis results identifying pregnancy as a contributing factor.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The study found:  
- **Significantly higher breast cancer incidence** in the pregnant group (16.0% vs. 2.3%, *p* = 0.0001).  
- **Actuarial rates** at 10 and 15 years were markedly higher in the pregnant group (6.7%–32.6% vs. 0.4%–1.7%, *p* = 0.011).  
- **Multivariate analysis** confirmed pregnancy around RT as the **only significant predictor** of increased risk (hazard ratio 22.49, 95% CI 5.56–90.88, *p* < 0.001).  
- The shorter latency period in the pregnant group supports biological plausibility (pregnancy increases breast tissue sensitivity to radiation).  

However, limitations include a **small sample size** (only 14 breast cancer cases) and **limited follow-up**. Despite these, the results are statistically robust and consistently point to an association.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence strongly suggests that RT around the time of pregnancy increases breast cancer risk compared to nonpregnant periods. While the study has limitations, the statistical significance, hazard ratio, and biological rationale support a definitive answer.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether radiotherapy (RT) administered around the time of pregnancy for Hodgkin's disease increases the risk of subsequent breast cancer. Key information to evaluate includes differences in breast cancer incidence, actuarial rates, latency periods, and statistical significance between pregnant and nonpregnant groups, as well as multivariate adjustments for confounding factors.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study found a significantly higher overall incidence (16.0% vs. 2.3%, *p* = 0.0001) and actuarial rates of breast cancer in the pregnant group (10-year: 6.7% vs. 0.4%; 15-year: 32.6% vs. 1.7%).  
- Multivariate Cox regression identified pregnancy around RT as the sole significant risk factor, especially when RT occurred during pregnancy or ≤1 month postpartum (HR = 22.49, 95% CI: 5.56–90.88, *p* < 0.001).  
- Limitations include small sample size (14 breast cancer cases) and limited follow-up, which the authors acknowledge. However, the statistical strength of the hazard ratio and actuarial rates supports a robust association.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study provides statistically significant evidence that RT near pregnancy increases breast cancer risk, likely due to heightened radiation sensitivity of breast tissue during pregnancy. While the authors recommend further validation, the data strongly support a "yes" answer.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: yes**
DeepSeek selected: yes

Initial consensus: All models selected yes
