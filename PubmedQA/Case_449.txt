Question: Treatment of contralateral hydrocele in neonatal testicular torsion: Is less more?

**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content:** The research question investigates whether a less invasive approach (scrotal incision only) for treating contralateral hydrocele in neonatal testicular torsion is as effective and safe as the traditional method that includes inguinal exploration.
- **Key Information to Identify:** 
  - Outcomes of using only a scrotal approach versus inguinal exploration.
  - Incidence of complications such as hydrocele or hernia following the chosen treatment method.
  - Long-term safety and effectiveness data supporting the approach.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results and Data:** 
  - Study reviewed 37 neonatal testicular torsion cases; 22 had contralateral hydrocele.
  - All hydroceles were managed exclusively through a scrotal approach without inguinal exploration.
  - No patients developed clinical hydrocele or hernia during an average follow-up of 7.5 years.
- **Strength and Reliability:** 
  - The study spans multiple years (1999-2006) with long-term follow-up, enhancing reliability.
  - Sample size is relatively small (37 patients), which may limit generalizability.
- **Relevance to the Question:** 
  - Directly addresses the safety and effectiveness of a scrotal-only approach versus traditional methods.
  - Provides empirical evidence supporting the minimal intervention strategy.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the data presented, managing contralateral hydrocele solely through a scrotal approach in neonatal testicular torsion cases appears to be safe and effective, with no reported long-term complications. Despite the small sample size, the consistent positive outcomes suggest that less invasive management ("less is more") is a viable approach.

**4. Final Answer:**
**My final choice is: "yes"**
GPT selected: yes

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether managing a contralateral hydrocele in neonatal testicular torsion using a scrotal approach (instead of an inguinal approach) is safe and effective, i.e., if "less intervention" (avoiding inguinal exploration) is better. Key points to address:  
- Does a scrotal approach alone for contralateral hydroceles prevent future complications (e.g., hernias, recurrent hydroceles)?  
- Does avoiding inguinal exploration reduce risks (e.g., spermatic cord injury)?  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Study Design**: Retrospective review of 37 neonates with testicular torsion between 1999–2006.  
- **Findings**:  
  - 22/37 had a contralateral hydrocele, all treated via scrotal approach.  
  - **No patient** developed a hydrocele or hernia after an average 7.5-year follow-up.  
  - Inguinal exploration was not performed, and no adverse outcomes were linked to omitting it.  
- **Strengths**: Long-term follow-up (up to 11.2 years) and clear absence of complications.  
- **Limitations**: Small sample size (37 patients), non-randomized, and single-institution data.  

The evidence directly addresses the question: avoiding inguinal exploration (a "less" approach) did not lead to complications and eliminated risks of inguinal surgery (e.g., cord injury).  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study demonstrates that managing contralateral hydroceles via scrotal incision alone is safe and effective, with no hernias or hydroceles developing post-treatment. Since inguinal exploration added no benefit and posed risks, the answer supports "less intervention."  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether avoiding inguinal exploration (a "less" invasive approach) for contralateral hydrocele management in neonatal testicular torsion is safe and effective, compared to formal inguinal exploration. Key points include evaluating outcomes like subsequent hydrocele/hernia development and risks of spermatic cord injury.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Study Design**: Retrospective review of 37 neonatal torsion cases (1999–2006), with 22 having contralateral hydroceles managed via scrotal fixation without inguinal exploration.  
- **Findings**: No patient developed hydrocele/hernia during long-term follow-up (average 7.5 years). No testicular or vasal injuries occurred.  
- **Strengths**: Long follow-up period (4.3–11.2 years) and clear clinical outcomes.  
- **Limitations**: Retrospective design and lack of direct comparison with inguinal exploration. However, the absence of complications strongly supports the safety of avoiding inguinal intervention.  
- **Relevance**: Directly addresses the safety and efficacy of a conservative (scrotal-only) approach for contralateral hydroceles.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence demonstrates that managing contralateral hydroceles through a scrotal approach alone prevented complications (hernia/recurrent hydrocele) and avoided risks associated with inguinal exploration. The study’s long-term follow-up and consistent outcomes strongly support the conclusion that "less" (no inguinal exploration) is safe and effective.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: yes**
DeepSeek selected: yes

Initial consensus: All models selected yes
