**1. Question Analysis**

- **Core Content**: The question seeks to determine if severe macrosomia (a condition where a newborn has an excessively high birth weight) is evident or can be identified at 11-14 weeks of gestation.
- **Key Information to Look For**: Evidence from the abstract that links fetal measurements or indicators at 11-14 weeks with the occurrence of severe macrosomia at delivery.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**

- **Study Design**: The case-control study compared 30 term severely macrosomic neonates with 90 appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA) neonates.
- **Measurements Taken**: All pregnancies underwent nuchal translucency (NT) screening between 11-14 weeks gestation, and crown-rump length (CRL) was measured.
- **Findings**:
  - Severe macrosomic neonates showed a statistically significant greater discrepancy between measured and expected CRL compared to controls (mean difference of 6.66 mm vs. 1.17 mm, P<0.0001).
  - There were significant correlations between the extent of macrosomia and the discrepancy in fetal size at the time of NT screening.
- **Strength and Reliability**: The results are statistically significant, indicating a strong association between early fetal biometric measurements and severe macrosomia.
- **Relevance**: Directly addresses the ability to identify severe macrosomia based on measurements taken at 11-14 weeks gestation.

**3. Conclusion**

Based on the study's findings, severe macrosomia can be associated with specific fetal biometric discrepancies detectable as early as 11-14 weeks of gestation. This suggests that severe macrosomia is manifested or can be predicted during this early period of pregnancy.

**4. Final Answer**

**My final choice is: "yes"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether severe macrosomia (excessive fetal growth) is detectable as early as 11-14 weeks of gestation. The key evidence to evaluate is whether fetal biometric measurements in this early period correlate with severe macrosomia at birth.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The study compared 30 severe macrosomic neonates with 90 appropriate-for-gestational-age controls. Fetal crown-rump length (CRL) was measured at 11-14 weeks. The macrosomic group had significantly larger CRL measurements compared to expected values (mean difference: 6.66 mm vs. 1.17 mm, *P* < 0.0001). This discrepancy also translated to a gestational age advancement of ~3 days in macrosomic cases. Strong correlations (*r* = 0.47–0.48, *P* < 0.01) between the CRL discrepancy and macrosomia severity further support the association. The study explicitly concludes that severe macrosomia manifests as early as 11-14 weeks.

**3. Conclusion**  
The data show that severe macrosomia is associated with accelerated fetal growth detectable via CRL measurements at 11-14 weeks. The significant differences and correlations between early fetal size and later macrosomia strongly support the conclusion that manifestations are present in this early gestational window.

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether severe macrosomia (excessive fetal growth) is detectable at 11-14 weeks of gestation. Key information to evaluate includes whether early fetal biometry (e.g., crown-rump length [CRL] at NT screening) correlates with later severe macrosomia at delivery.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study found a statistically significant difference in CRL measurements between severely macrosomic neonates and controls at 11-14 weeks: macrosomic neonates had a larger discrepancy between measured and expected CRL (6.66 mm vs. 1.17 mm, *P*<0.0001).  
- The correlation between CRL discrepancy and macrosomia severity was moderate but significant (*r* = 0.47–0.48, *P*<0.01).  
- The abstract explicitly concludes that severe macrosomia "manifests as early as 11-14 weeks' gestation," directly linking early biometry to later macrosomia.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence supports that severe macrosomia is associated with measurable differences in fetal size at 11-14 weeks. While the study design (case-control) cannot prove causation, the statistical significance, correlation strength, and explicit conclusion in the abstract strongly indicate that early manifestations exist.
