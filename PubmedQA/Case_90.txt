**1. Question Analysis**
The research question seeks to determine whether assessing urinary biomarkers is a non-invasive method for identifying tubular lesions in individuals with a solitary kidney (SK). Key aspects to consider include the effectiveness, sensitivity, and reliability of urinary biomarkers in detecting tubular damage without the need for invasive procedures.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
The abstract presents a cross-sectional study involving 37 patients with SK, divided into acquired and congenital groups. Urinary biomarkers measured include NAG, alpha-1-microglobulin, and albuminuria, alongside eGFR measurements. Key findings include:

- A significant increase in NAG and albuminuria levels in both acquired and congenital SK groups.
- Strong inverse correlations between urinary biomarkers and eGFR in both groups, indicating that higher biomarker levels are associated with declining renal function.
- The study concludes that urinary biomarkers provide a non-invasive, sensitive, and early assessment of tubular lesions, complementing eGFR measurements.

While the sample size is relatively small, the statistically significant correlations (p-values < 0.05) suggest reliability in the findings.

**3. Conclusion**
The study provides scientific evidence supporting the use of urinary biomarkers as a non-invasive approach to assessing tubular lesions in solitary kidney cases. The significant correlations between biomarker levels and renal function reinforce their potential utility in clinical settings.

**4. Final Answer**
**My final choice is: "yes"**
GPT selected: yes

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether urinary biomarkers can serve as a **non-invasive approach** to assess tubular (specifically tubulointerstitial) lesions in patients with a solitary kidney (SK). Key information to evaluate includes:  
- Whether the study confirms that urinary biomarkers are non-invasive.  
- Whether the biomarkers correlate with tubulointerstitial lesions or renal function in SK patients.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The abstract states that urinary biomarkers (NAG, α1-microglobulin, albuminuria) were measured in 37 SK patients (18 acquired, 19 congenital). Key findings include:  
- **Non-invasive nature**: Urinary biomarkers are inherently non-invasive because they require only urine collection, not invasive procedures like kidney biopsy.  
- **Correlation with renal function**: All three biomarkers inversely correlated with eGFR in both groups (e.g., R² = 0.743–0.821, p < 0.001), indicating their ability to track tubulointerstitial damage and renal function decline.  
- **Study conclusion**: The abstract explicitly states, "Urinary biomarkers allow a non-invasive, sensitive, early assessment of the tubular lesions of the SK," directly supporting the question.  

The evidence is strong because:  
- The study measured clinically relevant biomarkers known to reflect tubular injury (NAG, α1-microglobulin) and glomerular damage (albuminuria).  
- Statistical correlations were robust (high R² values and significant p-values).  
- The conclusion directly aligns with the question’s premise.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study provides clear evidence that urinary biomarkers are a **non-invasive method** for assessing tubulointerstitial lesions in SK patients. The biomarkers’ correlation with eGFR and the authors’ explicit conclusion confirm this. Thus, the answer is **"yes"**.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**
Qwen selected: yes

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether urinary biomarkers assessment is a non-invasive method to evaluate tubular lesions in solitary kidneys (SK). Key elements include:  
- **Non-invasiveness** of urinary biomarkers.  
- Association of biomarkers (e.g., NAG, alpha-1-microglobulin, albuminuria) with **tubulointerstitial lesions** in SK.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study measured urinary biomarkers (NAG, alpha-1-microglobulin, albuminuria) and eGFR in 37 SK patients (acquired and congenital).  
- Elevated urinary biomarkers (e.g., NAG in 60.66% of acquired SK, 52.63% of congenital SK) and inverse correlations with eGFR (statistically significant, e.g., \( p < 0.001 \)) suggest these markers reflect tubular injury and parallel renal function decline.  
- The abstract explicitly states urinary biomarkers enable **"non-invasive, sensitive, early assessment"** of tubular lesions, emphasizing their clinical utility.  
- Limitations include a small sample size (\( n = 37 \)), but robust correlations and statistical significance strengthen reliability.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study directly supports that urinary biomarkers (measured via non-invasive urine tests) correlate with tubular injury in SK and provide early, sensitive detection. The authors conclude this approach is non-invasive and clinically valuable.

**My final choice is: yes**
