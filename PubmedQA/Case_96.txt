**1. Question Analysis**

The core question investigates whether complex coronary lesions, specifically bifurcation and ostial lesions, are more frequent in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) compared to those without diabetes (nondiabetics). Key information to look for includes the prevalence rates of these lesions in both diabetic and nondiabetic groups, as well as any statistical significance indicating a difference between the two populations.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**

The study examined 1,014 patients, categorizing them into diabetic (281) and nondiabetic (733) groups. The prevalence of bifurcation lesions was 9.8% in diabetics versus 4.3% in nondiabetics (P=0.001), and ostial lesions were present in 38.4% of diabetics compared to 29.2% of nondiabetics (P=0.003). Both differences are statistically significant, suggesting that diabetes is associated with a higher prevalence of these complex coronary lesions. Additionally, multivariate analysis confirmed that DM is an independent predictor for both bifurcation and ostial lesions, further strengthening the evidence that diabetes is linked to an increased frequency of complex coronary lesions.

**3. Conclusion**

Based on the presented data, there is clear scientific evidence supporting that complex coronary lesions are more frequent in patients with diabetes mellitus compared to those without diabetes. The statistically significant higher prevalence rates in the diabetic group and the identification of DM as an independent predictor in the analysis corroborate this conclusion.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether complex coronary lesions (specifically bifurcation and ostial lesions) are more frequent in patients with diabetes mellitus compared to non-diabetics. Key information to identify in the abstract includes:  
- Prevalence rates of bifurcation and ostial lesions in diabetic vs. non-diabetic groups.  
- Statistical significance of differences in prevalence.  
- Whether diabetes is an independent predictor of these lesions after adjusting for confounders.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The abstract reports:  
- **Bifurcation lesions**: 9.8% in diabetics vs. 4.3% in non-diabetics (P=0.001).  
- **Ostial lesions**: 38.4% in diabetics vs. 29.2% in non-diabetics (P=0.003).  
Both differences are statistically significant. Multivariate analysis confirmed diabetes as an independent predictor for both lesion types (OR=2.27 for bifurcation, OR=1.40 for ostial lesions). The study’s large sample size (1,014 patients) and adjustment for confounders (e.g., age, hypertension) strengthen the reliability of these findings. The results directly address the question and show a clear association.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence demonstrates a statistically significant and independent association between diabetes mellitus and higher prevalence of both bifurcation and ostial coronary lesions. The study’s methodology and results strongly support the conclusion that complex coronary lesions are more frequent in diabetic patients.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**
Qwen selected: yes

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether complex coronary lesions (e.g., bifurcation and ostial lesions) occur more frequently in diabetic patients compared to nondiabetic patients. Key information to evaluate includes the prevalence of these lesions in diabetic versus nondiabetic groups, statistical significance of differences, and whether diabetes is an independent predictor after adjusting for confounders.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study (n=1,014) found significantly higher rates of bifurcation lesions (9.8% vs. 4.3%, *P=0.001*) and ostial lesions (38.4% vs. 29.2%, *P=0.003*) in diabetic versus nondiabetic patients.  
- Multivariate analysis confirmed diabetes mellitus (DM) as an independent predictor for both lesion types (OR=2.27 for bifurcation, *P=0.004*; OR=1.40 for ostial, *P=0.027*), even after adjusting for age and other risk factors.  
- The results are statistically robust (*P*-values <0.05), and the study accounts for confounders like age, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. The use of a quantitative angiographic system strengthens reliability.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study provides strong evidence that complex coronary lesions are more prevalent in diabetic patients, with DM identified as an independent predictor. The findings are statistically significant and methodologically sound, directly addressing the question.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: yes**
DeepSeek selected: yes

Initial consensus: All models selected yes
