**1. Question Analysis**
The core question investigates whether nurse-led preoperative education can reduce both anxiety levels and postoperative complications in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Key aspects to consider include:
- The role of nurse-led interventions in preoperative settings.
- Measurement of patient anxiety levels pre- and post-surgery.
- Assessment of postoperative complications such as chest infections, readmissions, and length of hospital stay.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
The abstract details a randomized controlled study with 395 cardiac surgery patients divided into intervention and control groups. The intervention group received preoperative education from specially trained nurses, while the control group received standard information from ward personnel. Findings include:
- A significant decrease in state anxiety levels in the intervention group compared to the control group (P=0.001).
- Greater mean decrease in state anxiety scores in the intervention group (P=0.001).
- No significant differences in length of stay or readmission rates between groups.
- A lower proportion of chest infections in the intervention group (5.3% vs. 0.5%; P=0.004).
- Education and initial trait anxiety scores were independent predictors of reduced state anxiety.

The study's randomized controlled design strengthens the reliability of the evidence. The significant reductions in anxiety and specific postoperative complications (chest infections) directly address the research question.

**3. Conclusion**
The evidence supports that nurse-led preoperative education effectively reduces anxiety levels and certain postoperative complications (specifically chest infections) in cardiac surgery patients. However, it does not impact readmission rates or the length of hospital stay.

**My final choice is: "yes"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether nurse-led preoperative education reduces anxiety and postoperative complications in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Key outcomes to evaluate are anxiety levels (measured via state-trait anxiety inventory) and postoperative complications. The abstract must be checked for statistically significant reductions in both outcomes in the intervention group compared to the control.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Anxiety Reduction**: The intervention group showed a significant decrease in state anxiety on the day before surgery (34.0 vs. 36.9; *P*=0.001) and a greater mean decrease in anxiety scores over time (*P*=0.001). These results are statistically significant and directly support reduced anxiety.  
- **Postoperative Complications**: The intervention group had significantly fewer chest infections (0.5% vs. 5.3%; *P*=0.004). While the abstract states "postoperative complications" were reduced, the only specific complication mentioned is chest infections. However, chest infections are a clinically relevant complication of cardiac surgery, and the study explicitly links the intervention to a reduction in this outcome.  
- **Other Outcomes**: The study found no significant differences in length of stay or readmissions, but the question does not ask about these.  

The study’s design (randomized controlled trial) and sample size (395 patients) enhance reliability. The reduction in anxiety and chest infections aligns with the question’s focus.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence shows that nurse-led preoperative education significantly reduced anxiety (state anxiety scores) and a key postoperative complication (chest infections). While the study did not universally reduce all complications (e.g., readmissions or LOS), the question does not specify exclusivity. Since the intervention successfully addressed both anxiety and at least one major complication, the answer is **yes**.

**My final choice is: "yes"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether nurse-led preoperative education reduces anxiety and postoperative complications in cardiac surgery patients. Key elements to evaluate include the impact on anxiety levels (measured at different time points) and specific postoperative outcomes (e.g., infections, length of stay, readmissions).  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Anxiety Reduction**: The intervention group showed a significant decrease in state anxiety before surgery (34.0 vs. 36.9, *P*=0.001) and a greater mean reduction in anxiety over time (*P*=0.001). Trait anxiety and education were independent predictors of anxiety reduction.  
- **Postoperative Complications**: The intervention group had fewer chest infections (0.5% vs. 5.3%, *P*=0.004). However, no significant differences were found in length of stay or readmissions.  
- **Study Design**: A randomized controlled trial (strong evidence) with a large sample (395 patients) supports reliability.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The abstract provides robust evidence that nurse-led education reduces anxiety and specific complications (chest infections). While not all complications improved, the question’s focus on "postoperative complications" is partially affirmed. Thus, the answer is **yes**.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**
