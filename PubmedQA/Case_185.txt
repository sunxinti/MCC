**1. Question Analysis**
The core question seeks to determine whether single-valve replacement is a safe surgical treatment for prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) in patients who have both mitral and aortic prosthetic valves (double prostheses). Key information to extract from the abstract includes the safety outcomes of single-valve replacement, mortality rates, cure rates, diagnostic accuracy, and any limitations or complications reported in the study.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
The study assessed 20 patients with PVE and double prostheses. Out of these, 17 underwent surgery, and 13 had only the valve identified as infected (single-valve replacement) replaced based on transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) findings. The TEE had a 100% positive predictive value for diagnosing the site of infection, indicating reliable preoperative assessment. However, 4 out of the 13 patients who underwent single-valve replacement died within a week post-procedure, which is a mortality rate of approximately 31%. The remaining 9 patients survived, completed antimicrobial therapy, and showed no relapses over an average follow-up of nearly 16 months. The small sample size (only 13 patients for single-valve replacement) limits the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the high early mortality rate raises concerns about the overall safety of the procedure, despite the positive long-term outcomes in survivors.

**3. Conclusion**
While the study suggests that single-valve replacement guided by TEE can lead to successful long-term outcomes in patients with PVE and double prostheses, the significant early mortality rate observed (31%) indicates potential safety concerns. The small sample size and lack of a control group further limit the strength of the evidence. Therefore, the evidence is mixed, showing both potential benefits and considerable risks.

**4. Final Answer:**
**maybe**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether single-valve replacement is safe in patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) who have double prostheses (both mitral and aortic). Key points to evaluate include the accuracy of preoperative diagnosis (via TEE), surgical outcomes (mortality, relapse), and the study's methodology.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Study Design & Results**: The study included 20 patients with double prostheses and PVE. TEE correctly identified the infected valve(s) with 100% positive predictive value. Of 17 surgical patients, 13 underwent single-valve replacement. Four died post-surgery (30.8% mortality), but nine survived without relapse over 15.78 months of follow-up.  
- **Strengths**: TEE’s high accuracy supports the reliability of preoperative diagnosis. No relapses in survivors suggest efficacy.  
- **Limitations**:  
  - Small sample size (only 13 patients in the single-valve group).  
  - High early mortality (4/13 deaths) raises safety concerns, though the abstract does not clarify causes of death.  
  - The study’s retrospective design and lack of a control group (e.g., comparing single vs. double valve replacement) limit definitive conclusions about safety.  
  - Mortality might reflect the high-risk nature of PVE rather than the surgical approach itself.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study suggests that when TEE accurately identifies the infected valve, single-valve replacement avoids relapse, supporting its safety in terms of efficacy. However, the 30.8% early mortality rate introduces uncertainty about procedural safety, especially given the small sample size and lack of control group. While the authors conclude it is a “safe strategy,” the mortality rate complicates a definitive “yes.” Thus, the answer leans toward **maybe**, acknowledging mixed evidence.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "maybe"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether single-valve replacement is safe for patients with double prostheses (mitral and aortic) and prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) when only one valve appears infected. Key information to assess includes:  
- Accuracy of preoperative diagnosis (TEE) in identifying infected valves.  
- Postoperative outcomes (mortality, cure rates, relapses).  
- Whether single-valve replacement led to missed infections or complications.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **TEE Accuracy**: TEE had a 100% positive predictive value for identifying infected valves, correlating with intraoperative findings. This supports targeted surgical decisions.  
- **Outcomes**:  
  - **Mortality**: 4/13 (30.7%) patients undergoing single-valve replacement died within a week postoperatively. The abstract does not clarify whether deaths were directly related to surgical strategy (e.g., residual infection) or other factors (e.g., comorbidities, surgical complications).  
  - **Survivors**: 9/13 patients survived, completed antimicrobial therapy, and showed no relapses during ~15-month follow-up.  
- **Limitations**:  
  - Small sample size (13 single-valve replacements), reducing statistical power.  
  - No comparison group (e.g., double-valve replacement outcomes) to assess relative safety.  
  - High early mortality raises concerns, but causality (e.g., surgical strategy vs. patient factors) is unclear.  
- **Abstract Conclusion**: States that echo-guided single-valve replacement "may be a safe strategy," but this is tempered by the mortality data and lack of comparative evidence.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence is mixed:  
- **Supporting "yes"**: TEE reliably identified infected valves, and survivors had excellent long-term outcomes.  
- **Supporting "no/maybe"**: High early mortality (30.7%) in single-valve patients, small sample size, and absence of comparative data limit definitive conclusions.  
The abstract’s cautious phrasing ("may be a safe strategy") and unresolved questions about mortality justify a **"maybe"** answer.
