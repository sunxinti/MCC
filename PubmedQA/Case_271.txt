Question: Can distal ureteral diameter predict reflux resolution after endoscopic injection?

**1. Question Analysis**
The core question is whether the distal ureteral diameter (UD) can predict the resolution of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) after endoscopic injection treatment in children. Key information to look for includes the relationship between UD measurements (and the UD ratio, UDR) and the success rates of reflux resolution as reported in the study.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
The study retrospectively reviewed 70 patients with primary VUR treated with endoscopic injection. The researchers measured the distal UD and calculated the UDR. The results indicated that both UD and UDR were significant predictors of reflux resolution, with p-values of <.007 and .001 respectively, suggesting strong statistical significance. Additionally, the abstract concludes that UDR serves as an objective measurement and predictive tool for success post endoscopic injection.

**3. Conclusion**
The evidence provided in the abstract supports the conclusion that distal ureteral diameter, specifically the UDR, can predict reflux resolution after endoscopic injection in children with primary VUR. The statistical significance and the study's conclusions align directly with the research question.

**4. Final Answer**
**My final choice is: "yes"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether distal ureteral diameter (UD) can predict reflux resolution after endoscopic injection in children with primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Key information to assess includes:  
- Whether the study directly tested UD as a predictor.  
- Statistical significance of UD/UDR (UD ratio) in predicting outcomes.  
- The study's conclusion regarding predictive value.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The study retrospectively analyzed 70 patients undergoing endoscopic injection for VUR. The abstract states:  
- UD and UDR (UD normalized by vertebral distance) were **significant predictors of reflux resolution** on logistic regression (*P* < 0.007 and *P* < 0.001, respectively).  
- The study explicitly concludes that UDR is an **objective predictive tool** for success after endoscopic injection.  
- While the study is retrospective and relies on a single radiologist’s measurements, the statistical significance and direct conclusion align with the question’s premise.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence shows that both UD and its normalized ratio (UDR) were statistically significant predictors of reflux resolution. Since the question specifically asks about UD, and UDR includes UD as a component, the study’s findings support that UD contributes to predicting outcomes. The conclusion in the abstract reinforces this. Thus, the answer is **"yes"**.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether distal ureteral diameter (UD) can predict reflux resolution after endoscopic injection in children with primary VUR. The key information to evaluate includes the study's methodology, statistical analysis (e.g., logistic regression results), and the reported relationship between UD/UDR and treatment success.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study retrospectively analyzed 70 patients with primary VUR treated via endoscopic injection.  
- Both UD and UDR (UD normalized to vertebral body distance) were tested as predictors.  
- Logistic regression identified UD and UDR as statistically significant predictors of reflux resolution (p < 0.007 for UD, p < 0.001 for UDR).  
- The abstract explicitly states that UDR provides an objective predictive tool, but UD itself also showed significant predictive value.  
- Limitations include the retrospective design and lack of details on confounding factors (e.g., injection technique variations). However, the statistical significance and direct focus on UD/UDR strengthen the evidence.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study demonstrates a statistically significant association between distal UD and reflux resolution, supporting its predictive value. While the abstract emphasizes UDR, the results confirm UD itself is a predictor. Thus, the answer is "yes."  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: yes**
DeepSeek selected: yes

Initial consensus: All models selected yes
