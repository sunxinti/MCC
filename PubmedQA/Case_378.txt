**1. Question Analysis**

The core question examines whether managing colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with synchronous liver metastases (SLM) at a single center ("global management", GM) leads to better patient outcomes compared to managing treatment at different centers ("separate management", SM). Key aspects to evaluate include overall survival, disease-free survival, number of procedures, use of chemotherapy, and mortality rates.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**

- **Overall Survival:** No significant difference between GM (67% at 3 years, 35% at 5 years) and SM (51% at 3 years, 31% at 5 years).
- **Disease-Free Survival:** SM showed higher rates at 5 years (14% vs. 11%, P = 0.009), though this might be influenced by selection bias.
- **Procedures:** GM was associated with fewer procedures (1.6 vs. 2.3).
- **Chemotherapy Usage:** Higher in SM (92%) versus GM (38%).
- **Mortality:** Slightly higher in GM (3%) compared to SM (0%), though not statistically significant.

The evidence suggests that while GM reduces the number of procedures, it does not offer a significant advantage in overall survival. The better disease-free survival in SM might be attributed to more stringent patient selection rather than the management approach itself.

**3. Conclusion**

Based on the data, global management at the same center does not improve overall survival and has mixed outcomes concerning disease-free survival. The advantages in procedure reduction do not translate into better survival outcomes.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether managing colorectal cancer (CRC) with synchronous liver metastases (SLM) using **global management (GM)** at the same center improves outcomes compared to **separate management (SM)**. Key outcomes to evaluate include survival rates, disease-free survival, procedural differences, and treatment strategies.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Overall Survival**: The abstract states that 3-year (67% SM vs. 51% GM) and 5-year (35% SM vs. 31% GM) overall survival rates were not statistically significant (n.s.).  
- **Disease-Free Survival**: SM was associated with significantly higher 5-year disease-free survival (14% vs. 11% for GM, *P* = 0.009).  
- **Procedural Differences**: GM involved fewer procedures (1.6 vs. 2.3, *P* = 0.003) and shorter delays between CRC and SLM surgeries (182 vs. 212 days). However, SM patients received more chemotherapy prior to liver resection (92% vs. 38%, *P* < 0.0001).  
- **Mortality**: Three-month mortality was similar (3% vs. 0%, n.s.).  

The study suggests that GM did not improve overall survival but was linked to fewer procedures. However, SM’s higher disease-free survival might reflect more rigorous patient selection or chemotherapy use in SM, which could influence outcomes. The lack of significant survival benefit for GM and the inferior disease-free survival compared to SM argue against an improvement in results with GM.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence shows no significant improvement in overall survival with GM. While GM reduced the number of procedures, SM was associated with better disease-free survival, possibly due to more aggressive chemotherapy use. The study’s findings do not support the claim that GM improves outcomes.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether global management (GM) of colorectal cancer (CRC) with synchronous liver metastases (SLM) at the same center improves outcomes compared to separate management (SM). Key factors include survival rates, procedural efficiency, chemotherapy use, and disease-free survival.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Overall Survival**: No significant difference between GM and SM at 3 years (67% vs. 51%) or 5 years (35% vs. 31%).  
- **Procedural Efficiency**: GM required fewer procedures (mean 1.6 vs. 2.3) and more often combined liver resection with colorectal surgery (62% vs. 6%).  
- **Chemotherapy/Delay**: SM used chemotherapy more frequently (92% vs. 38%) and had longer delays between surgeries (212 vs. 182 days).  
- **Disease-Free Survival**: SM had higher 5-year disease-free survival (14% vs. 11%, *P=0.009*), attributed to stricter patient selection.  
- **Limitations**: Retrospective design, non-randomized groups, and potential selection bias in SM.  

**3. Conclusion**  
GM reduced procedural complexity but did not improve survival outcomes. SM’s higher disease-free survival likely reflects better patient selection through prolonged chemotherapy and delayed resection, not superior management strategy. Since the primary survival endpoints showed no benefit for GM, the answer is **"no"**.
