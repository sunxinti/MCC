**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content**: The research question investigates whether evidence-based practice (EBP) leads to improved patient outcomes compared to standard practice (SP).
- **Key Information to Look For**:
  - Comparison of patient outcomes between EBP and SP units.
  - Statistical significance of the differences in outcomes.
  - Measures of reliability, such as sample size and study design.
  - Specific outcomes assessed, such as mortality rates, length of stay, and readmission rates.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results and Data**:
  - **Mortality Rates**: EBP group showed a decrease from 7.4% to 6.3% (P < 0.02).
  - **Length of Stay**: EBP group reduced from 9.15 to 6.01 days (P = 0.002).
  - **Risk of Death**: Clinically significant lower risk in EBP patients (6.27% vs. 7.75%, P < 0.001).
  - **Readmission Rates**: Similar between EBP and SP (14.4% vs. 14.5%).
  - **Patient Complexity**: No differences detected between services.
- **Strength and Reliability**:
  - The study is a natural experiment with a long follow-up period (2004-2011).
  - Comparisons were made before and after the reorganization, strengthening causal inferences.
  - Statistical significance is achieved in key outcomes.
- **Relevance**:
  - Directly addresses the research question by comparing EBP and SP regarding patient outcomes.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the data presented, EBP is associated with statistically and clinically significant improvements in patient outcomes, specifically in mortality rates and length of hospital stay, without increasing readmission rates or patient complexity.

**4. Final Answer:**
**My final choice is: "yes"**
GPT selected: yes

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether evidence-based practice (EBP) improves patient outcomes. Key points to evaluate in the abstract include:  
- Comparison between EBP and standard practice (SP) units.  
- Outcomes measured (mortality, length of stay, readmissions).  
- Statistical significance and clinical relevance of results.  
- Study design (natural experiment) and baseline comparability.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Baseline Comparison**: Before reorganization (2000–2003), no significant differences existed between EBP and SP doctors.  
- **Post-Reorganization Results**:  
  - Mortality in EBP dropped from 7.4% to 6.3% (P < 0.02) vs. their previous performance.  
  - Length of stay decreased from 9.15 to 6.01 days (P = 0.002) for EBP.  
  - Compared to SP *concurrently* (2004–2011):  
    - EBP had lower mortality (6.27% vs. 7.75%, P < 0.001).  
    - Shorter length of stay (6.01 vs. 8.46 days, P < 0.001).  
    - No difference in readmissions (14.4% vs. 14.5%).  
  - EBP doctors managed twice as many patients/doctor as SP.  
- **Strengths**: Natural experiment with longitudinal data, controlled for patient complexity and admission rates.  
- **Limitations**: Non-randomized design (potential confounding variables), reliance on routinely collected data.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study shows statistically and clinically significant improvements in mortality and length of stay for EBP compared to SP, with no deterioration in readmission rates. While the study design has limitations, the consistent results across multiple metrics and the lack of improvement in SP during the same period provide strong evidence that EBP improves patient outcomes.

**My final choice is: "yes"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether evidence-based practice (EBP) improves patient outcomes. The key information to evaluate includes mortality rates, length of hospital stay, readmission rates, and efficiency metrics (e.g., patients/doctor) comparing EBP and standard practice (SP) units.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Results**: After EBP implementation, mortality for EBP doctors decreased from 7.4% to 6.3% (*P* < 0.02), and length of stay dropped from 9.15 to 6.01 days (*P* = 0.002). Compared to SP, EBP patients had significantly lower mortality (6.27% vs. 7.75%, *P* < 0.001) and shorter stays (6.01 vs. 8.46 days, *P* < 0.001). Readmission rates were similar.  
- **Strength/Reliability**: The study design (natural experiment) reduces selection bias, as patients were comparable in complexity between groups. Pre-reorganization data showed no baseline differences, supporting causality. Statistical significance and consistency across outcomes (mortality, length of stay) strengthen validity.  
- **Limitations**: Observational design (not randomized), single-center study, and potential unmeasured confounders (e.g., physician motivation).  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study provides statistically and clinically significant evidence linking EBP to improved outcomes (reduced mortality, shorter stays) compared to SP, with no confounding differences in patient complexity. While limitations exist (non-randomized design), the results strongly support a "yes" answer.
