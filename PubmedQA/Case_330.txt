**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content:** The question seeks to determine whether performing a concomitant anterior/apical (AA) repair alongside a midurethral sling (MUS) procedure leads to better improvement in the overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms in women with mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) compared to performing MUS alone.
- **Key Information to Look For:** Comparative outcomes of OAB symptoms between patients undergoing MUS-only versus MUS combined with AA repair, specifically focusing on the change in Overactive Bladder Questionnaire Symptom Severity (OAB-q SS) scores.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results and Data:** The study involved 151 women with MUI, where 67 underwent MUS-only and 84 underwent MUS + AA. Both groups showed significant improvement in OAB-q SS scores postoperatively. However, the primary outcome revealed no significant difference in the change scores between the two cohorts (MUS-only: 30 ± 26 vs. MUS + AA: 25 ± 25, p = 0.20).
- **Strength and Reliability of Evidence:** The study is a retrospective cohort analysis, which provides a reasonable level of evidence but is not as robust as a randomized controlled trial. The sample size is moderate, and the p-value indicates no statistical significance in the primary outcome.
- **Relevance to the Question:** The evidence directly addresses the research question by comparing the OAB symptom improvements between the two surgical approaches.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the provided abstract, concomitant AA repair does not offer additional improvement in OAB symptoms over MUS alone in women with MUI. The lack of significant difference in the primary outcome supports this conclusion.

**4. Final Answer**
**My final choice is: "no"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether adding anterior/apical (AA) repair during midurethral sling (MUS) surgery improves the overactive bladder (OAB) component in patients with mixed urinary incontinence (MUI). The key focus is whether concomitant AA repair provides *additional* OAB symptom improvement beyond MUS alone. The primary outcome in the study is the change in OAB-q SS scores post-surgery between the two groups (MUS-only vs. MUS + AA).

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Primary Outcome**: The study found no significant difference in OAB-q SS change scores between the MUS-only group (30 ± 26) and the MUS + AA group (25 ± 25; p = 0.20).  
- **Multivariate Analysis**: Confirmed no difference in OAB symptom improvement between the cohorts.  
- **Relevance**: The study directly addresses the question by comparing the two surgical approaches in women with MUI. The primary outcome (OAB symptom change) aligns with the question.  
- **Strength**: The retrospective cohort design has limitations, but the sample size (n=151) and statistical analysis (regression) support the conclusion that AA repair does not add benefit for OAB symptoms.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence clearly shows that concomitant AA repair does not provide additional improvement in OAB symptoms compared to MUS alone. The lack of statistical significance (p = 0.20) and the absence of a difference in multivariate analysis indicate no added benefit. The study’s conclusion aligns with these findings.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "no"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether performing concomitant anterior/apical (AA) repair during midurethral sling (MUS) surgery improves the overactive bladder (OAB) component of mixed urinary incontinence (MUI). Key information to evaluate includes:  
- Comparison of OAB symptom improvement (via OAB-q SS scores) between MUS-only and MUS + AA repair groups.  
- Statistical significance of differences in outcomes.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study compared 67 women (MUS-only) and 84 women (MUS + AA).  
- Both groups showed significant postoperative improvement in OAB symptoms (*p* < 0.05).  
- The primary outcome (OAB-q SS change score) showed **no significant difference** between groups (30 vs. 25, *p* = 0.20).  
- Multivariate analysis confirmed no additional benefit from AA repair but identified postoperative complications (e.g., UTIs) as a negative predictor of OAB improvement.  
- Limitations include retrospective design, baseline differences in age/prolapse severity, and short follow-up (6 weeks).  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence demonstrates that concomitant AA repair does **not** provide additional improvement in OAB symptoms compared to MUS alone. The lack of statistical significance in the primary outcome and consistent findings in adjusted analyses support this conclusion.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: "no"**
