Question: Do older patients receive adequate stroke care?

**1. Question Analysis**
- The core question is whether older patients receive adequate stroke care.
- Key information to identify includes comparisons of diagnostic investigations, treatments, lifestyle modification advice, and overall resource utilization between older (>75 years) and younger (≤75 years) patients within stroke care.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- The study compared stroke care between older and younger patients referred to a neurovascular clinic between 2004 and 2006.
- **Diagnostic Investigations**: Older patients were less likely to receive MRI scans (4% vs. 26%) and carotid Doppler imaging (77% vs. 92%) compared to younger patients.
- **Lifestyle Modification Advice**: Younger patients were more likely to receive advice on weight reduction (30.2% vs. 12.9%) and diet (46.3% vs. 31.7%).
- **Treatment**: There were no differences in prescribed secondary preventive treatments, and older patients experienced less delay for carotid endarterectomy.
- **Resource Utilization**: Scans were performed more quickly in younger patients, and a higher percentage of younger patients received certain diagnostic tests.
- **Study Limitations**: The abstract does not mention potential confounders such as comorbidities, severity of stroke, or functional status, which could influence the provision of care. The study is also based on data from a single neurovascular clinic, which may limit generalizability.

**3. Conclusion**
- The evidence indicates that older patients are less likely to receive certain diagnostic investigations and lifestyle modification advice compared to younger patients. While some aspects of treatment were comparable or even more prompt in older patients, the reduced diagnostic and lifestyle support suggests gaps in the adequacy of stroke care for the elderly. However, the study's limitations, such as potential confounders and limited generalizability, mean that conclusions should be drawn cautiously.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether older patients (>75 years) receive adequate stroke care compared to younger patients (≤75 years). Key factors to evaluate include diagnostic testing, secondary prevention treatments, lifestyle advice, and timeliness of care as per national guidelines.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Diagnostic Investigations**: Older patients had lower rates of MRI scans (4% vs. 26%, *p*<0.01) and carotid Doppler imaging (77% vs. 92%, *p*<0.01) compared to younger patients. This suggests inadequate diagnostic evaluation for older patients.  
- **Lifestyle Advice**: Older patients received less advice on weight reduction (12.9% vs. 30.2%, *p*<0.01) and diet (31.7% vs. 46.3%, *p*=0.02), which are critical components of stroke prevention.  
- **Secondary Preventive Treatments**: Prescribed medications (e.g., anticoagulants, antiplatelets) were similar between groups, indicating no disparity in pharmacological interventions.  
- **Timeliness**: While older patients waited less for carotid endarterectomy (49 vs. 90 days, *p*<0.01), younger patients received scans faster, suggesting no major delays in surgical intervention for older patients.  
- **Study Limitations**: The study’s data (2004–2006) may not reflect current practices. The sample size (101 older patients out of 250 total) is moderate but sufficient for statistical comparisons. Selection bias may exist as patients were referred to a neurovascular clinic, potentially limiting generalizability.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence shows older patients received fewer diagnostic tests (MRI, carotid Doppler) and less lifestyle advice, which are critical aspects of stroke care. While secondary medications and some procedural timeliness were comparable, the omission of key diagnostic and preventive measures indicates inadequate care for older patients. The study’s conclusion aligns with this, emphasizing the need for guideline adoption to improve care. The limitations (e.g., older data) do not fully negate the findings, as disparities in diagnostics and lifestyle advice are well-supported.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether older patients receive adequate stroke care. Key elements to evaluate include disparities in diagnostic investigations, treatment delays, secondary prevention, and lifestyle advice between older (>75) and younger (≤75) patients, as per guideline recommendations.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Disparities in Care**: Older patients received fewer MRI scans (4% vs. 26%, p<0.01) and carotid Doppler imaging (77% vs. 92%, p<0.01). Lifestyle advice (weight reduction, diet) was also less frequent for older patients (p<0.01 and p=0.02, respectively).  
- **Comparable Aspects**: Secondary prevention treatments and CT scan rates were similar. Older patients experienced shorter delays for carotid endarterectomy (49 vs. 90 days, p<0.01).  
- **Statistical Significance**: Differences in MRI, Doppler, and lifestyle advice were statistically significant.  
- **Limitations**: Single-center study (generalizability concerns), observational design (cannot establish causation), and lack of outcome data (e.g., recurrent stroke rates). The study does not address whether reduced testing/advisory rates directly harm outcomes or reflect justified clinical decisions (e.g., contraindications for MRI).  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence shows significant disparities in guideline-recommended diagnostic investigations and lifestyle advice for older patients, suggesting potential inadequacies in care. However, limitations (e.g., single-center design, absence of outcome data) introduce uncertainty about the clinical impact of these disparities. The abstract’s conclusion emphasizes the need for guideline adoption, indirectly supporting a "no" answer. While the data strongly indicate gaps in care, the study’s design prevents definitive causal claims.
