Question: Is fetal gender associated with emergency department visits for asthma during pregnancy?

**1. Question Analysis**
   
   The core question seeks to determine whether the gender of the fetus is linked to the likelihood of pregnant women making emergency department (ED) visits for asthma. Specifically, it investigates two aspects:
   
   - Whether fetal gender affects the risk of having an ED visit for asthma during pregnancy.
   - Whether fetal gender is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes among women who have had at least one ED visit for asthma during pregnancy.
   
   Key information to look for in the abstract includes statistical associations between fetal gender and ED visits for asthma, as well as any related outcomes based on fetal gender.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
   
   The study analyzed data from 109,173 live singleton deliveries, identifying 530 women who visited the ED for asthma during pregnancy. The results indicated that fetal gender was not significantly associated with the risk of having an ED visit for asthma, as evidenced by an odds ratio (OR) of 1.01 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.85-1.19. Additionally, fetal gender did not predict adverse pregnancy outcomes such as low birth weight, preterm delivery, or Caesarian section among the women who had asthma-related ED visits. The large sample size and the use of multivariable logistic regression enhance the reliability of these findings.

**3. Conclusion**
   
   Based on the abstract, fetal gender does not have a significant association with the risk of ED visits for asthma during pregnancy. Furthermore, fetal gender is not linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes in this context. The evidence is strong and directly addresses the research question posed.

**4. Final Answer**
   
**My final choice is: "no"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The core question asks whether fetal gender is associated with emergency department (ED) visits for asthma during pregnancy. Key information to identify in the abstract includes the study's outcome measures (ED visits for asthma and adverse pregnancy outcomes), the statistical analysis (OR and CI for fetal gender), and the explicit conclusions regarding these associations.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The abstract states that fetal gender was not significantly associated with ED visits for asthma (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85–1.19). The confidence interval includes 1, indicating no statistically significant effect. Additionally, the study found no association between fetal gender and adverse outcomes (e.g., low birth weight, preterm delivery, or Caesarian section) among women with asthma-related ED visits. The large sample size (n=109,173) and use of multivariable logistic regression (accounting for confounders like age, income, and hypertension) strengthen the reliability of these findings. The conclusion directly addresses the question, confirming no association.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence clearly shows no statistically significant association between fetal gender and ED visits for asthma during pregnancy. The confidence interval for the odds ratio includes 1, and the study explicitly states fetal gender was not a significant predictor. Thus, the answer is "no."  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "no"**

DeepSeek is reasoning the answer...

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether fetal gender is linked to emergency department (ED) visits for asthma during pregnancy. Key information to identify includes:  
- Whether fetal gender (male/female) is a predictor of ED visits for asthma during pregnancy.  
- Statistical results (e.g., odds ratios, confidence intervals) and conclusions from the study.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study analyzed 109,173 singleton deliveries, with 530 cases of ED visits for asthma.  
- A multivariable logistic regression found **no association** between fetal gender and ED visits for asthma (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85–1.19).  
- The authors explicitly state that fetal gender does not affect the risk of asthma-related ED visits or adverse pregnancy outcomes in affected women.  
- The large sample size, use of administrative databases, and adjustment for confounders (e.g., income, hypertension) strengthen reliability.  
- The confidence interval includes 1.0, indicating nonsignificant results, and the OR is close to null.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence robustly supports that fetal gender is **not associated** with ED visits for asthma during pregnancy. The statistical analysis and explicit conclusion from the study directly answer the question.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: no**
DeepSeek selected: no

Initial consensus: All models selected no
