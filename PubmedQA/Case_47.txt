**1. Question Analysis**

- **Core Content:** The primary question investigates whether fenofibrate has a therapeutic role in treating sleep apnea syndrome.
- **Key Information to Identify in the Abstract:**
  - The effects of fenofibrate on key sleep apnea indices, particularly the apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) and the percentage of time with arterial oxygen saturation (SpO₂) below 90%.
  - Other relevant sleep variables and overall study design factors that might influence the results.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**

- **Study Results:**
  - **SpO₂ < 90%:** Fenofibrate significantly reduced the percentage of time participants spent with SpO₂ < 90% (from 9.0% to 3.5%) compared to placebo (10.0% to 11.5%), with a p-value of 0.007.
  - **Apnea/Hypopnea Index (AHI):** No significant change was observed in AHI with fenofibrate treatment compared to placebo (p = 0.533).
  - **Obstructive Apneas:** A significant reduction was noted in obstructive apneas with fenofibrate (44% reduction, p = 0.048).
  - **Non-cortical Micro-awakenings:** Fenofibrate also reduced these events per hour (p = 0.004).
  - **Other Sleep Variables:** No significant influences were observed.
  
- **Strength and Reliability of Evidence:**
  - **Study Design:** It is a proof-of-concept, exploratory study with a small sample size (34 subjects), which limits the generalizability of the findings.
  - **Duration:** The treatment period was relatively short (4 weeks), which may not capture long-term effects.
  - **Confounding Factors:** 35% of participants were on concomitant hypnotic treatment, and there was no correction for multiple testing, potentially affecting the reliability of the results.
  
- **Relevance to the Question:** While there are positive indications that fenofibrate may improve certain aspects of sleep apnea syndrome (e.g., SpO₂ levels and obstructive apneas), the lack of significant change in AHI, a primary measure of sleep apnea severity, and the study’s limitations suggest that the evidence is not conclusive.

**3. Conclusion**

Based on the evidence, fenofibrate shows potential in improving specific sleep apnea-related measures, but the lack of significant impact on AHI and the study’s methodological limitations mean that its role in treating sleep apnea syndrome remains uncertain. Further, more robust studies are needed to establish its efficacy.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether fenofibrate has a role in sleep apnoea syndrome, specifically seeking proof of concept from the study. Key information to evaluate includes:  
- Study design (randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled).  
- Primary outcomes (apnoea/hypopnoea index [AHI], oxygen saturation [SpO₂ <90%]).  
- Secondary outcomes (apnoeas, hypopnoeas, micro-awakenings).  
- Statistical significance and limitations (e.g., small sample size, short duration).  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Positive findings**: Fenofibrate significantly reduced the percentage of time with SpO₂ <90% (p=0.007) and obstructive apnoeas (p=0.048), as well as non-cortical micro-awakenings (p=0.004).  
- **Negative finding**: No significant change in AHI (primary endpoint; p=0.533).  
- **Limitations**: Small sample size (n=34), short treatment duration (4 weeks), exploratory design, lack of correction for multiple testing, and concomitant hypnotic use in 35% of participants.  
- **Relevance**: While secondary outcomes suggest potential benefits, the primary endpoint (AHI) did not reach significance, weakening the evidence for fenofibrate’s role.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study provides mixed results. Fenofibrate showed improvements in some sleep apnoea metrics (e.g., SpO₂ <90%, apnoeas, micro-awakenings), but the primary endpoint (AHI) was not significantly reduced. The exploratory nature, small sample size, and lack of correction for multiple testing limit the reliability of the findings. The abstract explicitly states that the results "may support further investigation," indicating insufficient evidence for a definitive conclusion.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether fenofibrate has a role in treating sleep apnoea syndrome, based on a proof-of-concept study. Key information to evaluate includes changes in sleep apnoea indices (e.g., AHI, SpO₂ <90%), statistical significance of results, study design limitations, and the authors' conclusions.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Results**: Fenofibrate significantly reduced the percentage of time with SpO₂ <90% (*p* = 0.007), obstructive apnoeas (44% reduction, *p* = 0.048), and non-cortical micro-awakenings (*p* = 0.004). However, the AHI (a primary outcome) did not improve significantly (*p* = 0.533).  
- **Limitations**: Small sample size (n=34), short treatment duration (4 weeks), concomitant hypnotic use (35%), lack of multiplicity correction, and exploratory design reduce the reliability of findings.  
- **Relevance**: While improvements in oxygen desaturation and obstructive apnoeas are clinically relevant, the lack of AHI improvement and study limitations prevent definitive conclusions.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study shows mixed results: some secondary endpoints improved, but the primary endpoint (AHI) did not. The authors describe the findings as exploratory and recommend further investigation. Given the limitations and partial efficacy, the evidence supports a "maybe" for fenofibrate’s role in sleep apnoea.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: maybe**
