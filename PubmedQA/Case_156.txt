**1. Question Analysis**

The core question is to determine whether low serum chloride levels are a risk factor for cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. Key information to identify includes:

- The relationship between serum chloride levels and CVD mortality.
- The strength and significance of this relationship.
- Control for potential confounding factors.
- The population studied and the study design to assess applicability and reliability.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**

The abstract provides data from a population-based cohort study involving 4,793 men and 4,313 women aged 25-74 years, free of symptomatic coronary heart disease at baseline. Serum chloride levels were measured and the cohort was followed for 10 years concerning cause-specific mortality.

Key findings include:

- Serum chloride was one of the strongest predictors of total, CVD, and non-CVD mortality.
- The association was independent of multiple confounders such as age, BMI, smoking, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, kidney function, other electrolytes, and diuretic use.
- Adjusted risk ratios for CVD death were significantly higher in individuals with low serum chloride levels (≤100 mmol/l) compared to those above the limit: 1.65 for men and 2.16 for women, both with confidence intervals that do not cross 1, indicating statistical significance.
- A dose-response relationship was observed, supporting causality.

The study's large sample size, long follow-up period, and robust statistical analysis (Cox regression controlling for various confounders) enhance the strength and reliability of the evidence. The findings are directly relevant to the question posed.

**3. Conclusion**

Based on the provided abstract, there is strong evidence from a well-conducted cohort study indicating that low serum chloride levels are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality. The association persists after adjusting for multiple confounding factors and demonstrates a dose-response relationship, which supports the role of low serum chloride as a risk factor for CVD mortality.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether low serum chloride level (<100 mmol/l) is a risk factor for cardiovascular mortality. Key information to assess includes:  
- The study's methodology (cohort design, sample size, follow-up duration).  
- Statistical analysis (adjusted for confounders, risk ratios, confidence intervals).  
- Whether low chloride was independently associated with cardiovascular mortality.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Study Design**: A large population-based cohort (4,793 men and 4,313 women, 10-year follow-up) with adjustment for multiple confounders (age, sex, BMI, smoking, blood pressure, cholesterol, creatinine, diuretic use, etc.).  
- **Results**:  
  - Adjusted risk ratio for CVD mortality in participants with serum chloride ≤100 mmol/l:  
    - Men: 1.65 (95% CI 1.06–2.57).  
    - Women: 2.16 (95% CI 1.11–4.22).  
  - Confidence intervals exclude 1, indicating statistical significance for both sexes.  
  - A dose-response relationship with total and CVD mortality was observed.  
  - The association remained independent of other electrolytes and established CVD risk factors.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study provides statistically significant and independently adjusted evidence that low serum chloride (<100 mmol/l) is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. The risk ratios are comparable to or higher than established risk factors, supporting a causal role. While observational studies cannot prove causation, the robustness of the analysis (large sample, long follow-up, adjustment for confounders) strengthens the validity of the association.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether low serum chloride levels are a risk factor for cardiovascular mortality. Key information to evaluate includes the study's design, adjusted risk ratios for CVD mortality, statistical significance, and independence from confounders (e.g., other electrolytes, diuretics, and established CVD risk factors).

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The cohort study (n=9,106) followed participants for 10 years, adjusting for multiple confounders (age, BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.) and other electrolytes.  
- Cox regression analysis showed serum chloride ≤100 mmol/l was independently associated with increased CVD mortality risk: adjusted risk ratios of 1.65 (men) and 2.16 (women), both with 95% CIs excluding 1 (statistically significant).  
- A log-linear dose-response relationship between lower chloride levels and higher CVD mortality was observed, reinforcing causality.  
- The study claims the risk ratios for low chloride are comparable to or higher than those of established CVD risk factors.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence strongly supports that low serum chloride (≤100 mmol/l) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular mortality, with robust adjustments for confounders, significant risk ratios, and a dose-response relationship. However, as this is the first reported population-based study, replication in other cohorts would strengthen generalizability.
