Question: Does strategy training reduce age-related deficits in working memory?

**1. Question Analysis**

The core question is whether strategy training can mitigate the decline in working memory (WM) performance associated with aging. Specifically, it seeks to determine if teaching older adults effective encoding strategies can reduce the observed deficits in WM compared to younger adults.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**

The study involved training both older and younger adults in effective verbal encoding strategies, such as interactive imagery and sentence generation. Results showed that:
- Both age groups improved their WM performance after training.
- However, the age-related deficit in WM performance remained largely unchanged despite the training.
- The benefits of training did not generalize to other cognitive tasks, indicating that the improvements were strategy-specific rather than reflecting broader cognitive enhancements.

This suggests that while strategy training can enhance WM performance overall, it does not specifically address the age-related differences in WM capabilities.

**3. Conclusion**

Based on the evidence, strategy training does improve WM performance in both older and younger adults. However, it does not significantly reduce the existing age-related deficits in working memory. The lack of transfer to other cognitive tasks further indicates that the training's impact is limited to the specific strategies taught, without alleviating the broader age-related WM decline.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether strategy training can reduce age-related deficits in working memory (WM). The key points to evaluate are:  
- Whether the training reduced the performance gap between older and younger adults.  
- The study's results on WM performance pre- and post-training in both age groups.  
- Whether the training specifically addressed age-related deficits.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The abstract states:  
- Both older and young adults improved WM performance after strategy training.  
- However, "the age-related WM deficit was not greatly affected," meaning the gap between older and younger adults remained largely unchanged.  
- Training gains did not transfer to other tasks, indicating strategy-specific (not general) benefits.  

The evidence shows that while strategy training improved WM performance in both groups, it did not significantly reduce the inherent age-related difference in WM performance. The deficit (the gap between age groups) persisted despite improvements in absolute performance.  

**3. Conclusion**  
Since the age-related WM deficit itself was not meaningfully reduced by the training, the answer is **no**. The training improved overall performance but did not close the gap between older and younger adults.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "no"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether strategy training reduces age-related deficits in working memory (WM). Key information to evaluate includes:  
- Whether strategy training improved WM performance in older adults.  
- Whether age-related differences in WM performance decreased after training.  
- Evidence of transfer effects to other cognitive tasks.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study found that **both young and older adults** improved WM performance after strategy training.  
- However, the **age-related WM deficit "was not greatly affected"**, indicating minimal reduction in performance gaps between age groups.  
- Training benefits were **strategy-specific**, with no transfer to other tasks (e.g., paired-associate recall, self-ordered pointing), even when participants attempted to adapt strategies.  
- The abstract explicitly states that benefits arose from **strategy-specific effects**, not domain-general cognitive gains, implying limited impact on underlying age-related deficits.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence shows that while strategy training improves WM performance in both age groups, it does not meaningfully reduce age-related deficits in WM. The persistent gap and lack of transfer effects suggest the training addresses strategy use rather than fundamental age-related cognitive limitations.
