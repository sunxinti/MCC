Question: Informed consent for total hip arthroplasty: does a written information sheet improve recall by patients?

**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content:** The research question aims to determine whether providing a written information sheet, in addition to an appropriate verbal explanation, enhances patients' recall of information during the informed consent process for total hip arthroplasty.
- **Key Information to Look For:** Comparative data on patient recall between those who received written information versus those who received only verbal information, the methodology of the study, sample size, and the statistical significance of the findings.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results and Data:** The study involved 126 patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty, divided into two groups: 65 received only verbal information, and 61 received both written and verbal information. The recall was assessed using a questionnaire approximately 18 days post-admission.
- **Findings:** Patients who received written information scored 48% on correct answers, compared to 38% in the verbal-only group. This difference was statistically significant, indicating better recall in the written information group.
- **Strength and Reliability:** The study design was a prospective randomized controlled trial, which is robust for assessing causality. However, the sample size is relatively moderate, and the study was conducted in a single specialized orthopaedic unit, which may affect generalizability.
- **Relevance to the Question:** The evidence directly addresses whether written information improves patient recall in the specific context of informed consent for total hip arthroplasty.

**3. Conclusion**
The study provides scientifically valid evidence that the use of written information sheets significantly improves patients' recall of information compared to verbal explanations alone in the informed consent process for total hip arthroplasty.

**4. Final Answer:**
**My final choice is: "yes"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether a written information sheet improves patient recall of information provided during informed consent for total hip arthroplasty. Key elements to evaluate include the study design, comparison groups (written vs. verbal information), outcome measures (recall accuracy), and statistical significance of results.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The study is a prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT), which is a robust design for evaluating interventions. Patients were randomly assigned to either a written information group (n=61) or a verbal-only group (n=65). The primary outcome—recall of information—was assessed via a questionnaire administered 18 days post-consent. The written group scored significantly higher (48% correct answers) than the verbal group (38% correct answers). The results directly address the question and show a statistically significant improvement in recall with written information. The study’s design minimizes bias, and the outcome measure aligns with the research question.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study provides clear evidence that a written information sheet improves patient recall compared to verbal information alone. The significant difference in recall scores (48% vs. 38%) and the RCT design support the conclusion. There is no conflicting evidence in the abstract, and the findings directly answer the question.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**
Qwen selected: yes

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether a written information sheet improves patients' recall of informed consent details for total hip arthroplasty. Key elements to evaluate include study design, group comparisons (verbal vs. written information), and measured outcomes (recall accuracy).

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study is a prospective randomized controlled trial (strong design) with 126 patients.  
- The written information group scored 48% correct answers vs. 38% in the verbal group, a statistically significant difference.  
- Recall was tested ~18 days post-interview, indicating short-term retention.  
- The abstract explicitly states that written sheets improve recall and serve as a medicolegal record. No major limitations or confounding factors are mentioned.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence supports that written information sheets significantly enhance recall compared to verbal information alone. The study’s design and results directly address the question, demonstrating a clear benefit.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**
DeepSeek selected: yes
