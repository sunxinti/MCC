Question: Does a geriatric oncology consultation modify the cancer treatment plan for elderly patients?

----- GPT's initial response -----
GPT is reasoning the answer...


**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content:** The research question seeks to determine whether a geriatric oncology consultation leads to changes in the cancer treatment plans for elderly patients.
- **Key Information to Identify:** The percentage of treatment plan modifications following the consultation, the reliability of these modifications, and the overall impact of the consultation on treatment decisions.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results:** The study included 105 patients aged 70 or older. Among the 93 patients with an initial treatment decision, 38.7% had their treatment plans modified after the geriatric oncology consultation.
- **Strength and Reliability:** The study provides a clear quantitative outcome, indicating a substantial proportion of treatment modifications. However, the abstract does not detail the study design robustness, potential biases, or long-term outcomes of these modifications.
- **Relevance:** The evidence directly addresses the research question by quantifying the extent to which treatment plans are altered following a geriatric oncology consultation.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the abstract, geriatric oncology consultations result in modifications to cancer treatment plans in approximately 38.7% of elderly patients. This provides clear evidence supporting that such consultations influence treatment decisions.

**4. Final Answer:**
**My final choice is: "yes"**
GPT selected: yes

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether a geriatric oncology consultation modifies cancer treatment plans for elderly patients. Key information to identify includes whether the study found a statistically significant or clinically relevant modification rate after such consultations and whether the evidence directly links the consultation to treatment changes.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The study reports that of 93 patients with an initial treatment decision, **38.7% had their treatment plan modified after the geriatric oncology consultation**. This modification rate is explicitly attributed to the consultation, as the assessment included functional status, comorbidities, and other geriatric domains. While the study is observational and does not compare outcomes to a control group, the direct correlation between the consultation and treatment plan changes is clear. The authors also note that specific factors (e.g., BMI, absence of depressive symptoms) were associated with modifications, further supporting the consultation’s role in altering treatment decisions.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The abstract provides direct evidence that geriatric oncology consultations led to treatment plan modifications in over one-third of cases. While the study does not assess long-term outcomes, the data clearly indicate that such consultations result in changes to treatment plans for a significant proportion of elderly patients.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**
Qwen selected: yes

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether geriatric oncology consultations modify cancer treatment plans for elderly patients. Key information to identify includes:  
- Study design (observational assessment of treatment plan changes pre- and post-consultation)  
- Proportion of patients with treatment plan modifications  
- Statistical associations between geriatric assessment domains and treatment changes  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study assessed 105 patients (≥70 years) referred to a geriatric oncology clinic.  
- Treatment plans were modified in **38.7% of cases** (36/93 patients) after consultation.  
- The authors explicitly state that the consultation "led to a modification of the cancer treatment plan in more than one third of cases."  
- Only BMI and absence of depressive symptoms were statistically associated with modifications, but the primary outcome (treatment plan change) was clearly reported.  
- The study directly links the consultation to treatment modifications, though it does not establish causality or long-term outcomes.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The abstract provides robust evidence that geriatric oncology consultations resulted in treatment plan changes for 38.7% of patients. This supports a "yes" answer, as the study demonstrates a measurable impact of the consultation on treatment decisions.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: yes**
DeepSeek selected: yes

Initial consensus: All models selected yes
