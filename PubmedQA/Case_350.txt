**1. Question Analysis**

The core question seeks to determine whether PET/CT provides additional benefits over multidetector CT (MDCT) in the preoperative staging of patients with liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma. Key aspects to consider include the accuracy of staging, impact on therapeutic decisions, sensitivity, specificity, and the rate of correct versus incorrect additional information provided by PET/CT.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**

The study involved 97 patients assessed for liver metastases of colorectal carcinoma using both MDCT and PET/CT. Key findings include:

- **Hepatic Staging:** MDCT/RM demonstrated significantly higher sensitivity (89.2%) compared to PET/CT (55%), indicating better detection of liver lesions with MDCT.
  
- **Extrahepatic Staging:** PET/CT was only superior to MDCT/MR in detecting locoregional recurrence and recurrence in uncommon sites. However, the overall additional findings from PET/CT led to a change in therapeutic strategy in only 17 patients, of which only 8 were correct, and 9 were incorrect.
  
- **Conclusion from the Study:** PET/CT has a limited role in hepatic staging due to its lower sensitivity in the liver and low positive predictive value (PPV) in extrahepatic locations. The potential for incorrect additional information suggests that its routine use may not be beneficial and should be reserved for specific high-risk cases.

**3. Conclusion**

Based on the study's results, PET/CT does not significantly enhance the preoperative staging process compared to MDCT alone. While it may offer some benefits in specific extrahepatic scenarios, the high rate of incorrect findings limits its overall utility. Therefore, its use should be more selective rather than systematic.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether PET/CT provides additional value compared to MDCT in preoperative staging of liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma. Key points to evaluate are the diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV) of PET/CT versus MDCT for hepatic and extrahepatic disease, and the impact on therapeutic decisions.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Hepatic Staging**: MDCT/MR had significantly higher sensitivity (89.2% vs. 55%, p < 0.001) than PET/CT, making it superior for detecting liver metastases.  
- **Extrahepatic Staging**: PET/CT was better than MDCT/MR only for detecting locoregional recurrence (p = 0.03) and uncommon-site recurrences (p = 0.016). However, PET/CT had a low PPV, leading to incorrect findings in 9% of cases.  
- **Therapeutic Impact**: While PET/CT altered management in 17 patients, only 8 changes were correct, and 9 were incorrect, raising concerns about harm from false positives.  
- **Conclusion of Study**: The abstract explicitly states that PET/CT has a "limited role" in hepatic staging and "potentially harmful" errors, supporting selective use (e.g., high-risk local recurrence).  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study demonstrates that PET/CT does not improve hepatic staging accuracy compared to MDCT and introduces risks of incorrect results. While it has minor advantages in detecting certain extrahepatic lesions, the overall net benefit is minimal, especially given the harm potential. The evidence strongly leans toward PET/CT not adding meaningful value beyond MDCT in most cases.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether PET/CT adds meaningful value to multidetector CT (MDCT) in preoperative staging of colorectal liver metastases (LMCRC). Key points to evaluate include comparative sensitivity/specificity of PET/CT vs. MDCT for hepatic/extrahepatic disease and the clinical impact (e.g., changes to treatment plans).

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Hepatic Staging**: MDCT/MR had significantly higher sensitivity (89.2%) than PET/CT (55%, *p < 0.001*), indicating PET/CT is inferior for liver lesion detection.  
- **Extrahepatic Staging**: PET/CT outperformed MDCT/MR only for detecting locoregional recurrence (*p = 0.03*) and uncommon-site metastases (*p = 0.016*), but its low positive predictive value (PPV) limited reliability.  
- **Clinical Impact**: PET/CT altered management in 17/97 patients (17.5%), but only 8/17 (8% overall) were correct, while 9/17 (9% overall) led to incorrect decisions.  
- **Conclusion of Abstract**: PET/CT has a "limited role" in hepatic staging, and while it improves extrahepatic detection in some cases, low PPV and harmful false positives justify selective use (e.g., high-risk patients).  

**3. Conclusion**  
PET/CT provides marginal benefits in extrahepatic staging but is inferior to MDCT for liver lesions. While it occasionally adds useful information (8% of cases), its high false-positive rate (9% harmful) and low PPV offset these gains. The study advocates selective use, implying PET/CT does not universally add value beyond MDCT. Thus, the answer is **"no"** for routine use, though **"maybe"** in high-risk subgroups. However, the question does not specify risk stratification, so the broader answer based on the studyâ€™s general findings is **"no"**.
