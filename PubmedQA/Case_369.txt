Question: Chemotherapy and survival in advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma: is pneumologists' skepticism justified?

**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content**: The primary question investigates whether the skepticism held by pneumologists regarding the use of chemotherapy for advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is justified based on real-world clinical evidence.
- **Key Information**: The abstract provides data on the survival benefits of chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC patients, factors influencing survival, and the study's conclusion addressing pneumologists' skepticism.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results**: The study included 190 patients with advanced NSCLC. Among them, 144 received cytostatic (chemotherapy) treatment, while 46 received palliative care. The median survival was significantly longer in patients undergoing chemotherapy (31 weeks) compared to those receiving only palliative care.
- **Statistical Significance**: Factors such as absence of weight loss, receiving cytostatic treatment, and a better ECOG score were significantly associated with improved survival. The p-values (<0.05) indicate that these findings are statistically significant.
- **Strength and Reliability**: The study utilized robust statistical methods, including Cox regression analysis, to determine independent predictors of survival, enhancing the reliability of the results.
- **Relevance**: The evidence directly addresses the effectiveness of chemotherapy in extending survival in advanced NSCLC patients, which is central to evaluating the validity of pneumologists' skepticism.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the presented data, chemotherapy significantly prolongs survival in patients with advanced NSCLC who have a performance status of less than 2. This evidence suggests that the skepticism among pneumologists toward chemotherapy is not entirely justified, as the treatment demonstrates clear survival benefits in a clinical setting.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether pneumologists' skepticism toward using chemotherapy in advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is justified. Key points to address include:  
- Whether chemotherapy's survival benefit demonstrated in clinical trials translates to real-world practice.  
- Whether the study's results support or refute the pneumologists' skepticism.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The abstract states:  
- **Chemotherapy was an independent predictor of survival** (HR 1.85; 95% CI 1.25–2.76; *P* = 0.002).  
- Median survival was **31 weeks** for chemotherapy-treated patients.  
- In patients with ECOG 2 (poorer performance status), chemotherapy still extended survival (15 weeks vs. 11 weeks for palliative treatment).  
- The study concludes that **reluctance toward chemotherapy is "not entirely justified"** because it improves survival in patients with ECOG ≤1 and even in those with ECOG 2.  

The evidence is **strong and directly relevant**:  
- The study uses robust statistical methods (Cox regression, Kaplan-Meier) and controlled for confounders.  
- The survival benefit was consistent across subgroups (e.g., ECOG 0–1 and 2).  
- The conclusion explicitly addresses the skepticism, aligning with the question's focus.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study demonstrates that chemotherapy significantly improves survival in advanced NSCLC patients with ECOG ≤2, even in real-world settings. This contradicts the premise that pneumologists' skepticism is justified. The evidence strongly supports the conclusion that skepticism is **not warranted**, as the survival benefit is evident in clinical practice.

**My final choice is: "no"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether pneumologists' skepticism toward chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC is justified, based on whether real-world outcomes mirror clinical trial benefits. Key information includes survival outcomes stratified by ECOG performance status (0-1 vs. 2) and cytostatic treatment efficacy in normal clinical practice.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study found chemotherapy significantly prolonged survival in patients with ECOG 0-1 (median survival not explicitly stated for this subgroup, but HR = 1.85, *P* = 0.002), particularly when weight loss was absent.  
- For ECOG 2 patients, chemotherapy provided a 4-week survival gain (15 vs. 11 weeks), which may not be clinically meaningful.  
- Multivariate analysis identified chemotherapy as an independent prognostic factor (HR = 1.85, 95% CI 1.25–2.76), supporting its efficacy in ECOG 0-1 patients.  
- The conclusion emphasizes that reluctance is "not entirely justified," acknowledging benefits in ECOG 0-1 but limited utility in ECOG 2.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study demonstrates chemotherapy improves survival in ECOG 0-1 patients (the majority of the cohort), aligning with trial data. Skepticism is partially justified for ECOG 2 patients but not for those with better performance status. Since the question broadly addresses pneumologists' skepticism (not restricted to ECOG 2), the evidence supports a "no" answer overall.
