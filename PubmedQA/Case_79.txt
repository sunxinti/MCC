**1. Question Analysis**
   
- **Core Content:** The question seeks to determine whether size-reducing ascending aortoplasty with external reinforcement remains a viable option in contemporary aortic surgery.
  
- **Key Information to Identify:**
  - **Procedure Details:** Size-reducing ascending aortoplasty with external reinforcement using a non-coated dacron prosthesis.
  - **Patient Population:** 50 patients out of 531 operated for aneurysm or ectasia of the ascending aorta.
  - **Outcomes Measured:** Hospital mortality, postoperative morbidity, reduction in aortic diameter, and long-term performance.
  - **Study Design:** Retrospective study conducted between 1997 and 2005 with a mean follow-up of 70 months.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
   
- **Research Results and Data:**
  - **Mortality and Morbidity:** Low hospital mortality rate of 2% and low postoperative morbidity.
  - **Aortic Diameter Reduction:** Significant decrease in aortic diameter from approximately 55mm to 40mm (CT) and from 54mm to 38mm (echocardiography), both with p<0.002.
  - **Long-term Performance:** Stable aortic performance over an average of nearly 6 years.
  
- **Strength and Reliability:**
  - **Study Design:** Retrospective studies can have limitations such as selection bias, but the relatively large initial sample size (531 patients) and specific focus on 50 patients who underwent the procedure add weight.
  - **Statistical Significance:** The p-values indicate statistically significant reductions in aortic diameter.
  - **Follow-up Duration:** A mean follow-up of 70 months provides substantial long-term data.

- **Relevance to the Question:** The evidence directly addresses the safety and efficacy of the procedure, supporting its consideration as a therapeutic option in specific clinical scenarios.

**3. Conclusion**
   
Based on the retrospective study's findings, size-reducing ascending aortoplasty with external reinforcement demonstrated low mortality and morbidity, significant reduction in aortic diameter, and stable long-term outcomes. These results support the procedure's viability as an option in modern aortic surgery under appropriate indications.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether size-reducing ascending aortoplasty with external reinforcement is a viable option in modern aortic surgery. Key factors to assess include the safety, efficacy, and long-term outcomes of this procedure as described in the abstract. The study’s focus is on patients with ascending aortic aneurysm/ectasia, with or without associated valve or coronary issues, and the specific surgical technique involving diameter reduction and external reinforcement.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Results**: The study reports a low hospital mortality rate (2%) and reduced postoperative morbidity. The aortic diameter significantly decreased post-surgery (from ~55mm to ~40mm) and remained stable over 70 months of follow-up.  
- **Strengths**: The sample size (50 patients) is reasonable for a retrospective study, and the follow-up period is lengthy. The procedure’s outcomes align with the abstract’s conclusion that it is "safe" and has "excellent long-term results."  
- **Limitations**: The study is retrospective, which may introduce selection bias. It does not compare this technique to modern alternatives (e.g., aortic root replacement), and the external reinforcement method (dacron prosthesis) may vary from current practices. However, the abstract explicitly states the procedure is a "therapeutic option" for specific cases (poststenotic dilatation without sinotubular junction impairment).  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence supports the use of size-reducing aortoplasty with external reinforcement as a safe and effective option for select patients, particularly those with poststenotic aortic dilatation. While modern surgical practices may favor alternative approaches in some scenarios, the study’s results and conclusion explicitly endorse this technique under specific indications. Thus, the answer should reflect that it remains a valid option in modern aortic surgery when criteria are met.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether size-reducing ascending aortoplasty with external reinforcement is a viable option in modern aortic surgery. Key elements to evaluate include the procedure’s safety, efficacy, and long-term outcomes as described in the abstract.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study retrospectively analyzed 50 patients who underwent the procedure, showing significant post-operative aortic diameter reduction (p<0.002) and stable long-term results (mean follow-up: 70 months).  
- Hospital mortality was low (2%), with minimal morbidity, and the procedure was often combined with other cardiac interventions (e.g., aortic valve replacement).  
- The abstract explicitly states the procedure is "a safe procedure with excellent long-term results" and recommends it as a therapeutic option for patients with poststenotic dilatation without sinotubular junction/aortic root involvement.  
- Limitations include the retrospective design and small sample size (50 patients), but statistical significance and long follow-up strengthen the findings.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence supports the procedure’s safety and efficacy in select patients (e.g., poststenotic dilatation without aortic root pathology). While generalizability to broader populations is unclear, the abstract directly endorses it as a valid option in modern aortic surgery for the specified indications.
