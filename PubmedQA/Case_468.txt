Question: Do elderly patients call 911 when presented with clinical scenarios suggestive of acute stroke?

**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content:** The primary question investigates whether elderly patients will call 911 when they encounter clinical scenarios indicative of an acute stroke.
- **Key Information to Find:** The percentage of elderly patients who correctly endorse the intention to call 911 upon recognizing stroke symptoms, factors influencing this decision, and overall awareness levels regarding appropriate responses to stroke symptoms.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results:** The study surveyed 367 elderly adults, finding that only:
  - 14% correctly endorsed the intention to call 911.
  - 65% would call an ambulance when presented with typical stroke signs and symptoms.
  - On average, only 37% chose the correct response consistently.
  - Higher education levels were associated with a greater likelihood of intending to call 911.
- **Strength and Reliability:** The study employed a standardized questionnaire (Stroke Action Test) and used logistic regression to assess predictors, which supports the reliability of the findings. However, the study is cross-sectional and limited to a specific geographic and socioeconomic population, which may affect generalizability.
- **Relevance:** The evidence directly addresses the research question by providing quantitative data on the likelihood of elderly patients calling 911 in stroke-like scenarios.

**3. Conclusion**
Given that a majority of elderly patients either do not intend or are inconsistent in their decision to call 911 when presented with stroke symptoms, the evidence suggests that elderly patients generally do not call 911 in such scenarios.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether elderly patients (≥60 years) call 911 when presented with clinical scenarios suggestive of acute stroke. Key information to evaluate includes the study's methodology, the percentage of participants who correctly endorsed calling emergency services, and the relevance of the results to the question.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The study found that only **14%** of 367 elderly participants correctly endorsed the intention to call 911 in stroke scenarios. Even with the most typical symptoms (e.g., sudden weakness or speech difficulty), only **65%** reported calling an ambulance. For Amaurosis Fugax (a transient visual loss), only **15%** would call 911. The average correct response rate across all scenarios was **37%**, far below the study’s predefined cutoff of ≥75%. These data indicate a significant gap in the elderly population’s tendency to seek timely emergency care for stroke symptoms. The results are directly relevant to the question and supported by quantitative data (ORs, confidence intervals) from a structured cross-sectional study.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence strongly suggests that elderly patients **do not** consistently call 911 when presented with clinical scenarios of acute stroke. The majority (86%) failed to endorse the correct action, with even the highest response rate (65%) falling short of the 75% threshold. This indicates a clear lack of appropriate action in most cases.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "no"**
Qwen selected: no

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether elderly patients call 911 when experiencing clinical scenarios suggestive of acute stroke. The critical information to identify includes the proportion of elderly patients who correctly endorsed calling emergency services and factors influencing this behavior.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study found **only 14% of elderly participants (≥60 years) correctly endorsed the intention to call 911** across stroke scenarios (using a ≥75% correct-response threshold).  
- Even for **typical stroke symptoms** (e.g., sudden weakness, speech difficulties), **only 65% reported they would call an ambulance**, with far lower rates for less typical symptoms (e.g., 15% for Amaurosis Fugax).  
- Higher education levels correlated with better intention to call, but overall, **correct responses averaged 37%**, indicating poor awareness.  
- The study concludes that interventions are needed to improve stroke symptom recognition and emergency response, implying inadequate current behavior.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence strongly indicates that **most elderly patients in this population did not demonstrate correct intention to call 911 during stroke scenarios**, with only a small minority (14%) meeting the threshold for appropriate action. While 65% would call for typical symptoms, this still reflects significant gaps, especially given the low overall performance. Thus, the answer is **"no"** based on the majority failing to endorse appropriate emergency responses.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: no**
DeepSeek selected: no

Initial consensus: All models selected no
