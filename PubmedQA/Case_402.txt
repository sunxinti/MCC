**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content:** The research question examines whether bone thickness and inter-radicular space influence the placement of miniscrews in the posterior mandibular regions.
- **Key Information to Identify:** The study’s findings on bone thickness and inter-radicular space measurements, their impact on miniscrew placement angles, and any relevant factors affecting these measurements.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results:** The study measured inter-radicular spaces (2.46 to 3.31 mm) and alveolar bone thickness (8.01 to 13.77 mm). It found that bone thickness decreases with an increased insertion angle from 45° to 90°. Additionally, the safest areas for miniscrew placement were identified between the first and second premolars and between the first and second molars.
- **Strength and Reliability:** The study involved a sample of 100 patients and used cone-beam computed tomography for precise measurements, enhancing the reliability of the data.
- **Relevance:** The findings directly address the question by correlating bone thickness and inter-radicular space with the optimal placement and angle of miniscrews in the posterior mandible.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the study’s evidence, bone thickness and inter-radicular space are significant factors influencing the placement of miniscrews in the posterior mandibular areas. The identification of specific safe areas further supports their impact.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether bone thickness and inter-radicular space influence the placement of miniscrews in the posterior mandible. Key factors to assess in the abstract include the study’s outcomes (bone thickness, inter-radicular space), insertion angles, and conclusions about placement safety.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The study analyzed bone thickness at 45°, 60°, and 90° insertion angles and inter-radicular space measurements. Results showed:  
- **Bone thickness decreased with increasing insertion angle** (e.g., thinner bone at 90° vs. 45°).  
- **Inter-radicular space ranged from 2.46–3.31 mm**, which may affect screw placement feasibility.  
- The safest placement areas (between premolars and molars) were identified **regardless of insertion angle**, implying anatomical factors (bone thickness and space) guide placement safety.  
- No gender or malocclusion differences were found, but the anatomical measurements directly relate to placement viability.  

The study’s methodology (CBCT, 3D analysis) is reliable for assessing bone structure, and the sample size (n=100) supports generalizability.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study demonstrates that **bone thickness decreases with insertion angle** and that **inter-radicular space varies anatomically**, both of which directly influence miniscrew placement safety and feasibility. The conclusion about "safest areas" explicitly ties these factors to clinical outcomes, confirming their relevance.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**
Qwen selected: yes

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether bone thickness and inter-radicular space influence miniscrew placement in posterior mandibular sites. Key information to evaluate includes:  
- Measured bone thickness at varying insertion angles (45°, 60°, 90°).  
- Inter-radicular space measurements.  
- Whether these anatomical factors affect placement safety or feasibility.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study found bone thickness decreases as insertion angle increases (from 45° to 90°), directly impacting anchorage and safety.  
- Inter-radicular spaces ranged from 2.46–3.31 mm, which is critical for avoiding root damage during screw placement.  
- The safest areas for placement were identified based on these measurements, emphasizing the importance of bone thickness and inter-radicular space.  
- No gender or malocclusion-related differences were observed, confirming anatomical factors (thickness/space) are primary determinants.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence confirms that bone thickness and inter-radicular space significantly affect miniscrew placement, as they determine safe insertion angles and sites. The study explicitly links these variables to clinical recommendations.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**
DeepSeek selected: yes

Initial consensus: All models selected yes
