Question: Does frozen section alter surgical management of multinodular thyroid disease?

GPT is reasoning the answer...


**1. Question Analysis**
The core question seeks to determine whether the use of frozen section (FS) during thyroid surgery influences the surgical management of patients with multinodular thyroid disease. Key information to identify includes whether FS results lead to changes in surgical decisions, its accuracy in diagnosing malignancy, and any impact on patient outcomes.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
The study retrospectively analyzed 236 patients with multinodular goiter who underwent thyroidectomy, with 135 patients receiving intra-operative FS. The findings revealed:
- No demographic or malignancy incidence differences between FS and non-FS groups.
- FS identified only 1 out of 4 thyroid cancers (25% sensitivity), missing 3 cases.
- Crucially, FS did not alter intraoperative management for any patient.
- The low sensitivity and lack of impact on surgical decisions suggest FS provided limited clinical utility in this context.

The evidence is robust within the study's scope, showing that FS did not influence surgical strategies despite its use.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the presented data, FS did not affect the surgical management of multinodular thyroid disease in the studied population. Given the lack of impact and low sensitivity, FS does not appear to be a useful tool for altering surgical decisions in these cases.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether frozen section (FS) evaluation during thyroid surgery alters the surgical management of patients with multinodular thyroid disease. Key information to assess includes:  
- Whether FS changed intraoperative decisions (e.g., extent of surgery, lymph node dissection).  
- The study’s findings on FS’s impact on management and diagnostic accuracy.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Study Results**: Of 236 patients, 135 underwent FS. **None of the 135 cases had a management change** due to FS results.  
- **Diagnostic Accuracy**: FS had a sensitivity of 25% for detecting cancer, with 3/4 cancers initially misread as benign.  
- **Relevance**: The question directly asks if FS altered surgical management. The study’s conclusion explicitly states that FS did not change intraoperative decisions in any case over the study period.  
- **Strength**: The data is derived from a retrospective analysis of 236 patients over a decade, providing clear, direct evidence.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study provides strong evidence that FS did not alter surgical management in any patient with multinodular thyroid disease. The authors’ conclusion aligns with this finding, emphasizing the lack of utility for routine FS in this context. The answer is **"no"** because the evidence unequivocally shows no impact on management.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "no"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether frozen section (FS) evaluation alters surgical management in multinodular thyroid disease. Key information to identify includes:  
- Whether FS results led to intraoperative management changes.  
- The diagnostic accuracy of FS (e.g., sensitivity for malignancy).  
- The study's conclusions about FS utility.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Data Summary**:  
  - 135/236 patients underwent FS.  
  - 4/135 had thyroid cancer on permanent histology, but FS missed 3 (sensitivity = 25%).  
  - **Critical Finding**: In none of the 135 patients did FS alter intraoperative management.  
- **Strength/Reliability**: Retrospective analysis with a substantial sample size (135 FS cases) and clear outcome reporting.  
- **Relevance**: Directly addresses the question by evaluating intraoperative management changes and FS diagnostic performance.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study demonstrates that FS did not alter surgical management in any patient, even when malignancy was later confirmed. The low sensitivity (25%) and lack of impact on intraoperative decisions strongly support the conclusion that FS lacks utility in this context.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: no**
