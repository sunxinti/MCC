**1. Question Analysis**

- **Core Content**: The primary question investigates whether educating medical residents about the potential effects of radiation exposure from CT scans will lead to changes in their CT ordering practices.
- **Key Information to Identify**: The study's impact on the number and types of CT scans ordered post-education, the adoption of alternative imaging modalities, and any shifts in clinical decision-making or patient education practices.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**

- **Research Results and Data**:
  - **CT Ordering Frequency**: 90% of residents maintained the same number of CT scans ordered post-education, while 10% reduced their CT orders.
  - **CT Types**: 14% altered the types of CT scans they ordered.
  - **Alternative Imaging**: 33% increased the use of alternative imaging modalities such as MRI (24%) and ultrasound (19%).
  - **Patient Education**: 38% used the lecture information to educate patients about radiation risks.
  - **Referring Physicians**: There was notable interest from referring physician groups in radiation education.

- **Strength and Reliability**:
  - **Sample Size**: The study surveyed 21 residents, which is a relatively small sample size, potentially limiting the generalizability of the results.
  - **Methodology**: The study utilized a survey method post-educational intervention, which provides direct insights but may be subject to response biases.
  
- **Relevance**:
  - The evidence directly addresses the question by assessing changes in CT ordering practices following an educational intervention.

**3. Conclusion**

The majority of residents (90%) did not change the number of CT scans they ordered after receiving education about radiation exposure. While there were some changes in the types of CT scans and an increase in the use of alternative imaging modalities among a subset of residents, these changes were not predominant. Therefore, the evidence suggests that educational interventions have a limited impact on altering overall CT ordering practices among residents, although they may influence specific behaviors and promote patient education.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The core question is whether educating residents about radiation effects from CT scans alters their CT ordering behavior. Key information to assess includes changes in the number and types of CT scans ordered, use of alternative imaging, and the overall impact of the educational intervention described in the abstract.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Number of CT scans**: 90% (19/21) of residents maintained constant CT ordering, while 10% (2/21) reduced orders.  
- **Types of CT scans**: Only 14% (3/21) changed the types of CT scans ordered.  
- **Alternative imaging**: 33% (7/21) increased use of alternatives like MRI or ultrasound.  
- **Physician interest**: Referring physicians showed interest in radiation education, and other groups requested similar lectures.  
- **Abstract conclusion**: "Most clinicians did not change their CT scan ordering after receiving education about radiation."  

The evidence shows minimal changes in CT ordering practices (only 10% reduced orders, and 14% altered scan types). The majority maintained their habits. While some shifted to alternative imaging and engaged patients in discussions, the primary outcome—CT ordering patterns—remained largely unchanged. The study’s small sample size (21 residents) and lack of comparison group (e.g., control arm) limit the strength of the evidence but align with the abstract’s conclusion.

**3. Conclusion**  
The study’s results indicate that education did **not** lead to significant changes in CT ordering practices for most residents. While a minority adjusted their behavior, the majority maintained their prior habits. The abstract explicitly states that "most clinicians did not change their CT scan ordering," directly answering the question with a **no**.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether educating residents about radiation exposure from CT scans changes their CT ordering practices. Key information needed includes post-education changes in CT order frequency, shifts to alternative imaging, and evidence of behavioral impact.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Data from the abstract**:  
  - 90% (19/21) of residents reported no change in CT order volume post-education.  
  - Only 10% (2/21) reduced CT orders, and 14% (3/21) altered CT types.  
  - 33% (7/21) increased alternative imaging (e.g., MRI/ultrasound).  
  - The study explicitly states, "Most clinicians did not change their CT scan ordering after receiving education."  
- **Strength/Reliability**: Small sample size (21 residents) limits statistical power, but the findings are directly relevant to the question.  
- **Relevance**: Directly addresses the hypothesis that education impacts CT ordering behavior.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence shows minimal impact on CT order frequency (90% unchanged) despite some increased use of alternatives. The abstract explicitly concludes no major change in ordering practices. Thus, the answer is **"no"**.
