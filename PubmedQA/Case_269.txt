**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content:** The question seeks to determine whether first-line single-agent mitoxantrone is as effective as combination chemotherapy (FEC regimen) in treating high-risk metastatic breast cancer patients.
- **Key Information to Identify in the Abstract:**
  - Comparison of effectiveness between mitoxantrone and FEC.
  - Outcomes measured: response rate, remission duration, time to progression, overall survival.
  - Additional factors: toxicity, quality of life, and subgroup analyses.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results:**
  - **Effectiveness:** The study found no significant difference between mitoxantrone and FEC in response rate, objective remission rate, remission duration, time to response, time to best response, time to progression, or overall survival.
  - **Quality of Life:** Single-agent mitoxantrone showed a significant advantage in the modified Brunner's score, indicating better quality of life and lower toxicity compared to the combination therapy.
  - **Subgroup Analysis:** No evidence suggested that any specific subgroup would benefit more from combination chemotherapy.
- **Strength and Reliability:**
  - **Sample Size:** 260 women, which is a substantial sample for such studies.
  - **Study Design:** Randomized controlled trial, which is the gold standard for clinical research.
  - **Duration:** Follow-up until 1999, providing adequate time for outcome assessment.
- **Relevance:** Directly addresses the research question by comparing the efficacy and quality of life outcomes between the two treatment regimens.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the study's findings, single-agent mitoxantrone is as effective as combination FEC chemotherapy in terms of key clinical outcomes for high-risk metastatic breast cancer patients. Additionally, mitoxantrone offers better quality of life and lower toxicity, making it a viable alternative to combination therapy.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether first-line single-agent mitoxantrone is as effective as combination chemotherapy (FEC) in high-risk metastatic breast cancer patients. Key outcomes to evaluate include response rates, remission duration, time to progression, overall survival, and the modified Brunner's score (which includes toxicity and quality of life).  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study randomized 260 patients to mitoxantrone or FEC.  
- **Primary endpoints**: No significant differences were found in response rate, objective remission rate, remission duration, time to progression, or overall survival between the two groups.  
- **Modified Brunner's score**: Favored single-agent mitoxantrone due to lower toxicity (less alopecia and vomiting) and better quality of life.  
- The abstract explicitly states that combination chemotherapy did not demonstrate superiority in efficacy parameters, and the necessity of combination therapy is questioned.  

The evidence is reliable as it is a randomized controlled trial with clear endpoints and long-term follow-up. The results directly address the question’s focus on efficacy equivalence.  

**3. Conclusion**  
Since the study shows no significant difference in efficacy outcomes (response, progression, survival) between single-agent mitoxantrone and FEC, the answer is "yes." While combination therapy had no advantage in efficacy, single-agent mitoxantrone offered better toxicity and quality of life, further supporting its equivalence in effectiveness.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether single-agent mitoxantrone is as effective as combination chemotherapy (FEC) as first-line treatment for high-risk metastatic breast cancer. Key information to evaluate includes objective efficacy measures (response rate, survival) and composite outcomes (e.g., Brunner’s score) from the study.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The randomized trial (N=260) found **no significant differences** between mitoxantrone and FEC in objective outcomes: response rate, remission duration, time to progression, and overall survival.  
- The modified Brunner’s score (incorporating efficacy, toxicity, and quality of life) significantly favored mitoxantrone, primarily due to reduced toxicity and better quality of life.  
- The study explicitly concluded that combination chemotherapy’s necessity is questionable given the lack of efficacy advantage.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence shows comparable efficacy between mitoxantrone and FEC in objective clinical outcomes. While combination chemotherapy did not demonstrate superior effectiveness, the Brunner’s score highlights quality-of-life benefits for mitoxantrone. Thus, the answer is **"yes"** regarding equivalence in effectiveness for the specified outcomes.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: yes**
DeepSeek selected: yes

Initial consensus: All models selected yes
