**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content**: The question seeks to determine whether African American (AA) women require fewer calories than non-AA women to maintain their weight.
- **Key Information to Look For**:
  - Comparison of caloric needs between AA and non-AA women.
  - Controlled study conditions to assess resting metabolic rate (RMR) and caloric intake.
  - Statistical significance of the findings.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results and Data**:
  - Initial observation showed AA women had a higher mean calorie intake (2168 kcal) compared to non-AA women (2073 kcal), which was statistically significant (P<.05).
  - However, after adjusting for potential confounders, the difference in caloric intake between AA and non-AA women was negligible (-2.8 kcal) and not statistically significant (P = .95).
- **Strength and Reliability**:
  - The study was a controlled feeding trial with a substantial sample size (206 women, 73% AA), enhancing the reliability of the findings.
  - Randomization and adjustment for confounders strengthen the validity of the conclusions.
- **Relevance**:
  - The evidence directly addresses the question by comparing the caloric requirements under controlled conditions.
  - The conclusion explicitly states that AA women do not require fewer calories to maintain weight.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the controlled study's findings and after adjusting for confounders, there is no evidence to support that African American women require fewer calories than non-AA women to maintain their weight.

**4. Final Answer:**
**My final choice is: "no"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether African American (AA) women require fewer calories than non-AA women to maintain weight. The key focus is on comparing caloric needs between these groups, with the study's results addressing this by examining calorie intake during a controlled feeding study aimed at weight maintenance.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The study found that during the intervention, AA women consumed **94.7 kcal more per day** on average than non-AA women (2168 vs. 2073 kcal, *P* < 0.05). However, after adjusting for confounders such as baseline weight, body mass index (BMI), and age, the difference disappeared (Δ = -2.8 kcal, *P* = 0.95). The abstract explicitly states that the results **do not support** the hypothesis that AA women require fewer calories to maintain weight. The study's design (controlled feeding to maintain weight) directly addresses the question, and the adjusted analysis accounts for potential biases like higher baseline weight in AA women.

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence shows no significant difference in caloric needs between AA and non-AA women after adjusting for confounders. The initial observed difference was likely due to AA women's higher baseline weight and BMI, not lower metabolic rate. Thus, the study refutes the idea that AA women require fewer calories for weight maintenance.

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "no"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether African American (AA) women require fewer calories than non-AA women to maintain weight, specifically examining if a lower resting metabolic rate (RMR) in AA women contributes to higher obesity rates. Key information to evaluate includes:  
- Comparison of caloric intake between AA and non-AA women in a controlled feeding study.  
- Adjustment for confounders (e.g., baseline weight, BMI) to isolate racial differences.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Results**: Unadjusted data showed AA women required *more* calories (2168 vs. 2073 kcal/day, *P<.05*). After adjusting for weight, BMI, and other factors, the difference vanished (Δ = -2.8 kcal, *P=0.95*).  
- **Study Design**: A rigorous controlled feeding trial (DASH trial) minimizes variability in dietary intake, enhancing reliability.  
- **Conclusion**: The abstract explicitly states no evidence supports the claim that AA women need fewer calories to maintain weight.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The adjusted analysis—accounting for baseline weight and BMI differences—showed no statistically significant difference in caloric requirements between AA and non-AA women. The study directly refutes the hypothesis, providing strong evidence against the claim.
