**1. Question Analysis**

- **Core Content:** The question seeks to determine whether sternal plating, when used for primary and secondary sternal closure, can enhance sternal stability.
  
- **Key Information to Look For:**
  - Comparison between traditional sternal closure methods (e.g., wire cerclage) and those augmented with sternal plates.
  - Evidence of improved sternal stability when plates are added.
  - Data supporting the effectiveness of sternal plating in preventing sternal separation or complications like mediastinitis.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**

- **Research Results and Data:**
  - The study involved 18 human cadavers undergoing midline sternotomy.
  - Four closure techniques were tested, including traditional methods and those with added sternal plates.
  - Intrathoracic pressure required to cause sternal separation increased significantly when plates were added:
    - From 183.3 mmHg (wires/cables alone) to 301.4 mmHg (wires/cables + one plate).
    - Further increased to 355.0 mmHg with the use of four plates.
  - The p-value was <0.05, indicating statistical significance.
  
- **Strength and Reliability:**
  - The study uses a cadaver model, which is appropriate for biomechanical testing.
  - The sample size (18 cadavers) is modest but sufficient to demonstrate significant differences.
  - Statistical analysis (repeated measures ANOVA and Regression Coefficients) supports the reliability of the findings.
  
- **Relevance to the Question:**
  - Directly assesses the impact of sternal plating on sternal stability.
  - Provides quantitative data showing improved resistance to sternal separation with plating.
  - Concludes that adding plates can reduce the risk of complications like sternal dehiscence, especially in high-risk patients.

**3. Conclusion**

Based on the abstract, the addition of sternal plates to traditional closure methods significantly improves sternal stability. The data demonstrates a clear and statistically significant increase in the pressure required to cause sternal separation when plates are used, supporting the hypothesis that sternal plating enhances stability.

**4. Final Answer**

**My final choice is: "yes"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether sternal plating (adding plates) improves sternal stability during primary and secondary closure. The key evidence to evaluate is whether the study's results demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in sternal stability when plates are added compared to wires/cables alone.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Results**: The study shows that adding a single plate to wires/cables increased the intrathoracic pressure required to cause 2.0 mm sternal separation (from 183.3 to 301.4, *p* < 0.05). Using four plates further increased this threshold to 355.0.  
- **Statistical Significance**: The differences were statistically significant (*p* < 0.05), and regression coefficients confirmed the benefit of plates (120–142 mmHg improvement).  
- **Relevance**: The study directly addresses sternal stability under pressure, a critical factor in preventing dehiscence. While the model is cadaveric, biomechanical outcomes are strongly relevant to clinical stability.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study provides clear evidence that sternal plating (even a single plate) significantly improves sternal stability compared to wires/cables alone. The results align with the hypothesis and directly answer the question.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether sternal plating improves sternal stability during primary/secondary closure. The abstract evaluates four closure techniques in cadavers, measuring intrathoracic pressure required to cause 2.0 mm sternal separation. Key evidence includes displacement pressure data and statistical significance of plating compared to traditional wiring/cabling.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study found that adding one plate increased displacement pressure from 183.3 ± 123.9 (wires/cables alone) to 301.4 ± 204.5, and four plates further increased it to 355.0 ± 210.4 (p<0.05).  
- Regression coefficients confirmed significant stability improvements with plating (95% CIs excluding zero).  
- The cadaver model provides strong biomechanical evidence but lacks clinical outcomes (e.g., healing, infection). However, the results directly address mechanical stability, the question’s focus.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The data robustly supports that sternal plating (with 1 or 4 plates) enhances stability in this cadaver model. While clinical validation is needed, the abstract’s biomechanical evidence directly answers the question affirmatively.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**
DeepSeek selected: yes

Initial consensus: All models selected yes
