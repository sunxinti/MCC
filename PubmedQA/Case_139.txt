**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content:** The research question seeks to determine whether the preoperative platelet count is a prognostic factor in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).
- **Key Information to Identify:** The relationship between preoperative platelet count and patient survival, statistical significance of the findings, and whether platelet count remains an independent prognostic factor after controlling for other variables.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results and Data:** The study analyzed 425 ESCC patients and identified a platelet count cutoff of 205 ×10^9/L. Patients with platelet counts ≤205 had significantly better 5-year survival rates compared to those with counts >205 (60.7% vs. 31.6%, P<0.001). In nodal-positive patients, the difference was even more pronounced (32.0% vs. 12.7%, P=0.004).
- **Strength and Reliability:** The study utilizes a substantial sample size (425 patients) and employs retrospective analysis with statistical methods like ROC curves and multivariate analysis, which enhances reliability.
- **Relevance to the Question:** The evidence directly addresses the prognostic value of preoperative platelet count in ESCC patients, establishing it as an independent factor influencing survival outcomes.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the presented data, preoperative platelet count is a significant and independent prognostic factor in ESCC patients, particularly in those with nodal involvement. The results are statistically significant and relevant to the research question.

**4. Final Answer**
**My final choice is: "yes"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether preoperative platelet count is a prognostic factor for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Key information to assess includes:  
- Whether the study found a statistically significant association between platelet count and survival outcomes.  
- Whether platelet count was identified as an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis.  
- The cutoff value and subgroup analyses (e.g., node-positive vs. node-negative patients).  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Survival Outcomes**: The study found that patients with preoperative platelet counts ≤205 ×10⁹/L had significantly better 5-year survival (60.7% vs. 31.6%, P<0.001) compared to those with higher platelet counts.  
- **Subgroup Analysis**: In node-positive patients, the survival difference was significant (32.0% vs. 12.7%, P=0.004), but not in node-negative patients (P=0.085).  
- **Multivariate Analysis**: Platelet count was confirmed as an independent prognostic factor (P=0.013), along with T grade and N staging.  
- **Strength of Evidence**: The study used a retrospective cohort of 425 patients, a validated cutoff via ROC curve, and adjusted for confounders in multivariate analysis. The results are statistically significant in key subgroups and the overall population.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study provides clear evidence that preoperative platelet count is associated with survival in ESCC, particularly in node-positive patients. The multivariate analysis confirms its independence from other factors. While the effect was nonsignificant in node-negative patients, the overall and subgroup results support platelet count as a prognostic factor. Thus, the answer is **"yes"**.

**My final choice is: "yes"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether preoperative platelet count is a prognostic factor in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Key information to evaluate includes survival outcomes stratified by platelet count, statistical significance, and whether platelet count was identified as an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study (n=425) identified a platelet count cutoff of 205×10⁹/L via ROC analysis.  
- Patients with platelet counts ≤205 had significantly better 5-year survival (60.7% vs. 31.6%, *P*<0.001), particularly in node-positive subgroups (32.0% vs. 12.7%, *P*=0.004).  
- Multivariate analysis confirmed platelet count (*P*=0.013), T grade (*P*=0.017), and N staging (*P*<0.001) as independent prognostic factors.  
- Retrospective design may introduce bias, but robust statistical methods (ROC, multivariate adjustment) strengthen validity.  
- The conclusion explicitly states platelet count is a predictive factor, especially in node-positive patients.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study provides statistically significant evidence that preoperative platelet count independently predicts survival in ESCC, particularly in advanced cases. Despite being retrospective, the rigorous methodology supports its reliability.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: yes**
DeepSeek selected: yes

Initial consensus: All models selected yes
