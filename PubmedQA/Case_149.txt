Question: Is solitary kidney really more resistant to ischemia?

**1. Question Analysis**  
The core question is whether a solitary kidney is more resistant to ischemia compared to paired kidneys. Key information to identify includes comparative outcomes of ischemia between solitary and paired kidneys, measures of kidney function recovery, histopathological findings, and expression levels of proinflammatory markers.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The study used a canine model with two groups: solitary kidney (group 1) and paired kidneys (group 2), each consisting of ten dogs. Both groups underwent warm ischemia by occluding the renal artery for 90 minutes.  
- **Kidney Function:** Group 1 showed a 20% decrease in clearance at 1 week with recovery starting at week 2. In contrast, Group 2 experienced a more than 90% decrease up to week 2, with recovery commencing at week 3 and a 23% reduction by week 4.
- **Histopathology:** Group 1 had 60% tubular necrosis at 3 days with regeneration beginning at 1 week. Group 2 had more severe tubular necrosis at 90%, with regeneration starting only at 2 weeks.
- **Proinflammatory Markers:** Both groups showed up-regulation, but it was higher and more sustained in Group 2.

The evidence consistently indicates that the solitary kidney exhibits better resilience and quicker recovery from ischemic injury compared to paired kidneys in this canine model. However, the study's small sample size and animal model limit the generalizability to humans.

**3. Conclusion**  
Based on the presented data, there is scientific evidence suggesting that a solitary kidney is more resistant to ischemia than paired kidneys in the studied canine model.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether a solitary kidney is more resistant to ischemia than paired kidneys, based on the provided study. Key factors to evaluate include functional outcomes (e.g., renal clearance), histopathological findings (e.g., tubular necrosis and regeneration), and inflammatory markers (CD95, TNF-α) between the two groups.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Functional Outcomes**: In group 1 (solitary kidney), renal clearance decreased by only 20% at 1 week and recovered by week 2. In contrast, group 2 (paired kidneys) showed a >90% clearance reduction up to week 2, with incomplete recovery (23% reduction at 4 weeks).  
- **Histopathology**: Group 1 showed 60% tubular necrosis at 3 days, with regeneration starting by week 1. Group 2 had more severe necrosis (90%) and delayed regeneration (starting at week 2).  
- **Inflammatory Markers**: Proinflammatory markers were upregulated in both groups, but the elevation was higher and more prolonged in group 2.  
- **Conclusion from Abstract**: The study explicitly states that the solitary kidney is "more resistant to ischemia than paired kidneys" based on radiological, pathological, and genetic evidence.  

The study’s design (comparing solitary vs. paired kidneys under controlled ischemia) and outcomes directly address the question. The results consistently show better functional recovery, less severe histological damage, and lower inflammatory activity in the solitary kidney group. These data are strong and relevant to the question.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence strongly supports the conclusion that solitary kidneys are more resistant to ischemia than paired kidneys. The functional, histological, and molecular data all align with this finding, and the abstract explicitly confirms it.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether a solitary kidney is more resistant to ischemia compared to paired kidneys. The key information to evaluate includes functional recovery (renogram), histopathological damage, and proinflammatory marker expression in solitary vs. paired kidneys after warm ischemia.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Functional Recovery**: Group 1 (solitary kidney) showed a 20% clearance reduction at 1 week with full recovery by week 2, whereas group 2 (paired kidneys) had >90% reduction up to week 2, with incomplete recovery (23% reduction) at 4 weeks.  
- **Histopathology**: Group 1 had 60% tubular necrosis (regeneration at 1 week), while group 2 had 90% necrosis (regeneration delayed until 2 weeks).  
- **Proinflammatory Markers**: Group 2 exhibited higher, sustained expression of CD95 and TNF-α, indicating prolonged inflammation.  
- **Study Design**: Controlled canine model with consistent warm ischemia duration, validated by radiological, pathological, and molecular metrics.  

The evidence is robust within the experimental context (animal model), showing clear differences in recovery and injury severity. However, generalizability to humans requires caution.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study provides strong experimental evidence that solitary kidneys in dogs are more resistant to ischemia than paired kidneys, based on faster functional recovery, reduced histopathological damage, and attenuated inflammatory responses. While species differences exist, the data directly support the conclusion.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: yes**
