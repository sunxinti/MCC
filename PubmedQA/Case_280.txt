Question: Is nasogastric decompression useful in prevention of leaks after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy?

**1. Question Analysis**

- **Core Content:** The question seeks to determine whether the use of nasogastric decompression (via a nasogastric tube) is effective in preventing staple line leaks after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG).
- **Key Information to Extract:** Incidence of leaks in both groups (with and without nasogastric decompression), statistical significance of the differences, and any additional outcomes that might influence the interpretation (e.g., hospital stay duration).

**2. Evidence Evaluation**

- **Research Design:** A prospective, randomized study involving 145 patients divided into two groups: 70 with a nasogastric tube (Group A) and 75 without (Group B).
- **Results:**
  - **Leak Incidence:** 1.4% in Group A (1 patient) vs. 0% in Group B.
  - **Statistical Significance:** The difference in leak rates was not statistically significant.
  - **Other Outcomes:** Group A had a significantly longer postoperative hospital stay compared to Group B (7.6 vs. 6.2 days, p=0.04).
- **Strength and Reliability:** While the study is prospective and randomized, the low incidence of leaks and the small sample size limit the strength of the conclusions. Additionally, only one leak occurred, making it difficult to draw robust conclusions about the effectiveness of nasogastric decompression.
- **Relevance:** The evidence directly addresses the research question by comparing leak rates between patients with and without nasogastric decompression.

**3. Conclusion**

Based on the study, nasogastric decompression did not show a significant benefit in reducing the incidence of staple line leaks after LSG. Moreover, it was associated with a longer hospital stay. However, the limited number of leak events and sample size suggest that further research might be necessary for a definitive conclusion.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether nasogastric (NG) decompression reduces the incidence of staple line leaks after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). Key information to evaluate includes the study design, group comparisons (NG tube vs. no NG tube), leak rates, statistical significance, and conclusions from the abstract.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Study Design**: Prospective, randomized trial with 145 patients divided into two groups (n=70 and n=75). Groups were comparable in demographics, intraoperative factors (blood loss, operative time), and complication rates.  
- **Outcomes**:  
  - **Leak Incidence**: 1 leak (1.4%) in Group A (NG tube) vs. 0 leaks in Group B (no NG tube).  
  - **Statistical Analysis**: The abstract states no statistical difference in leak rates between groups (p not reported for this comparison). However, the conclusion explicitly states that NG tube placement "seems not useful in reducing leaks' incidence."  
  - **Other Findings**: Longer hospital stay in Group A (NG tube), though this is a secondary outcome.  

The study’s randomized design minimizes selection bias, and the primary outcome (leak rate) showed no benefit from NG decompression. The authors’ conclusion aligns with the data, suggesting NG tubes do not prevent leaks and may prolong hospitalization without efficacy.

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence indicates that NG decompression does not reduce staple line leaks after LSG. While Group A had a numerically higher leak rate (1.4% vs. 0%), the lack of statistical significance and the authors’ conclusion support rejecting the utility of NG tubes for this purpose. Thus, the answer is "no."

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether nasogastric decompression (NGT) reduces staple line leaks after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). Key information to evaluate includes leak rates in patients with vs. without NGT placement and statistical significance of differences.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study compared 70 patients with NGT (Group A) and 75 without (Group B).  
- Leak incidence: **1.4% (1/70) in Group A vs. 0% (0/75) in Group B**.  
- No statistical differences in baseline characteristics, operative time, or blood loss.  
- Postoperative stay was significantly longer in Group A, but leak rates were not statistically compared (p-value not provided for leaks).  
- The authors conclude NGT does not reduce leaks.  

Limitations include small sample size (low power to detect rare events like leaks) and lack of statistical analysis for leak rates. However, the absence of leaks in Group B and the authors' conclusion suggest no benefit from NGT.

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence indicates no reduction in leaks with NGT; leaks occurred only in the NGT group, though not statistically significant. The authors explicitly state NGT is not useful. While the study has limitations, the data and conclusion align with "no."

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: no**
