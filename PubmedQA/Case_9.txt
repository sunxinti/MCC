Question: Should cavitation in proximal surfaces be reported in cone beam computed tomography examination?

**1. Question Analysis**

The core question is whether cavitation in proximal surfaces should be reported when performing a cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) examination. This involves determining if CBCT is sufficiently accurate in detecting cavitated lesions in proximal surfaces compared to traditional bitewing radiographs, thereby justifying its inclusion in dental reports.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**

The study examined 79 adjacent proximal surfaces without restorations in permanent teeth using both bitewing radiographs and CBCT. The results showed that CBCT had significantly higher sensitivity (by an average of 33%) and overall accuracy (p<0.001) in detecting cavitations compared to bitewings, while specificity was not significantly different between the two methods (p = 0.19). These findings suggest that CBCT is more reliable in identifying true positive cases of cavitation without increasing false positives.

**3. Conclusion**

Given the higher sensitivity and overall accuracy of CBCT in detecting cavitated lesions in proximal surfaces, it is scientifically justified to report such findings. Including cavitation assessments in CBCT examinations can lead to better diagnostic outcomes and more informed clinical decisions.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether cavitation in proximal surfaces of unrestored permanent teeth should be reported during a cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) examination. Key information includes:  
- CBCT's accuracy compared to bitewing radiographs for detecting cavitation.  
- The study's conclusion that CBCT is more accurate and should be assessed for proximal cavities when performed for other reasons.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Results**: CBCT showed significantly higher sensitivity (33% higher) and overall accuracy (p<0.001) than bitewings for detecting cavitation. Specificity was similar.  
- **Validity**: The study used a validated clinical method (orthodontic separators removed after 3 days to confirm cavitation), had ethical approval, and involved two observers.  
- **Relevance**: The abstract explicitly states that CBCT should be assessed for proximal cavities when performed for other clinical reasons, and detected cavities "must be part of the dentist's report."  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study provides strong evidence that CBCT is superior to bitewings for detecting proximal cavitation. The authors explicitly recommend reporting cavitation findings in CBCT scans performed for other purposes. Thus, the answer should align with this recommendation.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**
Qwen selected: yes

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether cavitation in proximal surfaces should be reported in CBCT examinations. Key information to evaluate includes the study's comparison of CBCT and bitewing radiographs in detecting cavitation, statistical outcomes (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy), and the authors' conclusions regarding clinical reporting.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study found CBCT had significantly higher sensitivity (33% average difference, *p*<0.001) and overall accuracy (*p*<0.001) compared to bitewings, with no significant specificity difference (*p*=0.19).  
- Validation via clinical examination (orthodontic separators) confirmed cavitation status, strengthening reliability.  
- The abstract explicitly concludes that CBCTâ€™s superior accuracy justifies reporting proximal cavitation when detected, especially in CBCT scans performed for other purposes.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence strongly supports that CBCT is more effective at detecting cavitation than bitewings, and the authors recommend reporting such findings. Given the statistically validated results and direct relevance to the question, the answer is "yes."  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: yes**
DeepSeek selected: yes

Initial consensus: All models selected yes
