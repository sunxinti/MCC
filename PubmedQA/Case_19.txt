Question: Is fear of anaphylactic shock discouraging surgeons from more widely adopting percutaneous and laparoscopic techniques in the treatment of liver hydatid cyst?

**1. Question Analysis**
The core question investigates whether the fear of anaphylactic shock is a deterrent for surgeons in adopting percutaneous and laparoscopic techniques for treating liver hydatid cysts. Key information to look for includes the prevalence of fear-induced reluctance among surgeons and any supporting data from the research context that links this fear to the hesitance in using minimal-access techniques.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
The abstract presents a survey conducted among 30 surgeons in northern Jordan. Findings indicate that only 10% (3 surgeons) preferred laparoscopy as the primary treatment method. A significant 78% (21 out of 27) of the surgeons who did not adopt minimal-access techniques cited fear of anaphylaxis and/or dissemination as their main reason. While the sample size is relatively small and geographically limited, the high percentage suggests a strong association between fear of anaphylactic shock and reluctance to adopt these surgical techniques.

**3. Conclusion**
The evidence from the survey strongly suggests that fear of anaphylactic shock plays a significant role in discouraging surgeons from widely adopting percutaneous and laparoscopic methods for liver hydatid cyst treatment, at least within the studied population.

**4. Final Answer:**
**My final choice is: "yes"**
GPT selected: yes

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether fear of anaphylactic shock is a reason surgeons avoid using percutaneous and laparoscopic techniques for treating liver hydatid cysts. Key information to verify includes:  
- Whether the study identifies fear of anaphylaxis as a stated reason for avoiding these techniques.  
- The prevalence of this fear among surveyed surgeons.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The abstract states that in a survey of 30 surgeons in northern Jordan:  
- Only 10% (3 surgeons) used laparoscopy as a first-line treatment.  
- Of the 27 surgeons not using minimal-access techniques, 78% (21/27) cited "fear of anaphylaxis and/or dissemination" as the main reason.  
- The abstract explicitly concludes that "the seemingly exaggerated traditional fear of anaphylaxis" discourages adoption of these techniques.  

The evidence is directly relevant and strongly supports the link between fear of anaphylaxis and reluctance to adopt minimal-access methods. While the sample size (30 surgeons in one region) and study design (survey) may limit generalizability, the data explicitly and quantitatively tie fear of anaphylaxis to the surgeons' choices.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study provides clear, direct evidence that fear of anaphylaxis is a major factor discouraging surgeons from adopting percutaneous and laparoscopic techniques for liver hydatid cysts. The high percentage (78%) of surveyed surgeons citing this fear as their primary reason strongly supports the answer "yes."  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**
Qwen selected: yes

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether fear of anaphylactic shock is a key factor preventing surgeons from adopting percutaneous/laparoscopic techniques for liver hydatid cysts. The key information needed is evidence linking surgeons' reluctance to this specific fear.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The abstract reports a survey of 30 surgeons in northern Jordan: 78% (21/27) of surgeons avoiding minimal-access techniques cited fear of anaphylaxis/dissemination as their primary reason.  
- The study explicitly states that "fear of anaphylaxis and/or dissemination" was the main deterrent, supporting a direct causal link.  
- While the sample size is small and limited to one region, the data strongly aligns with the conclusion that fear of anaphylaxis drives reluctance. The abstract emphasizes this as a "seemingly exaggerated traditional fear," further validating its perceived influence.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence directly associates surgeons' avoidance of minimal-access techniques with fear of anaphylaxis. Despite potential regional or sample biases, the data explicitly answers the question.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**
DeepSeek selected: yes

Initial consensus: All models selected yes
