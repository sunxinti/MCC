**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content**: The research question seeks to determine whether the routine insertion of an endoscopic nasobiliary drainage (ENBD) tube after the endoscopic removal of common bile duct (CBD) stones is necessary for patients suffering from choledocholithiasis-induced acute cholangitis.
- **Key Information to Look For**:
  - Clinical outcomes associated with ENBD insertion, such as recurrence of cholangitis and length of hospital stay.
  - Any adverse effects or drawbacks of ENBD insertion, such as increased procedure time and patient discomfort.
  - The study design and reliability of the evidence provided.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results and Data**:
  - **Recurrence of Cholangitis**: No significant difference between the ENBD group (3.9%) and the no-ENBD group (3.8%) at 24 weeks (P = .99).
  - **Length of Hospital Stay**: Identical between both groups, averaging 7.9 days (P = .98).
  - **Procedure Time**: Significantly longer in the ENBD group (26.2 minutes) compared to the no-ENBD group (22.7 minutes) with P = .01.
  - **Discomfort Score**: Higher in the ENBD group (4.9) versus the no-ENBD group (2.8) with P = .02.
- **Strength and Reliability**:
  - The study is a prospective, randomized trial conducted in a tertiary referral center, which adds to its reliability.
  - Sample size of 104 patients provides a reasonable basis for the conclusions, though being a single-center study may limit generalizability.
- **Relevance to the Question**:
  - Directly addresses whether ENBD insertion affects clinical outcomes post-CBD stone clearance in acute cholangitis cases.
  - Clearly shows lack of benefit in key outcomes while highlighting associated drawbacks.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the evidence, routine insertion of an ENBD tube does not provide clinical benefits in terms of reducing cholangitis recurrence or shortening hospital stays. Additionally, it introduces drawbacks like longer procedure times and increased patient discomfort. Therefore, the routine use of ENBD in this clinical scenario is not supported.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether routine insertion of a nasobiliary drainage (ENBD) tube is necessary after endoscopic clearance of the common bile duct in patients with choledocholithiasis-induced cholangitis. The key outcomes to evaluate are recurrence of cholangitis, hospital stay duration, and potential harms (procedure time, discomfort).  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Recurrence of Cholangitis**: The recurrence rate was nearly identical between groups (3.9% vs. 3.8% at 24 weeks; *P* = 0.99), indicating no benefit of ENBD in preventing cholangitis recurrence.  
- **Hospital Stay**: The length of hospital stay was statistically similar (7.9 days vs. 7.9 days; *P* = 0.98), showing no advantage of ENBD in reducing hospitalization.  
- **Harms**: ENBD insertion was associated with significantly longer procedure time (+3.5 minutes; *P* = 0.01) and higher patient discomfort (+2.1 score; *P* = 0.02).  
- **Study Design**: The study was a prospective, randomized trial (gold standard for clinical evidence), though conducted at a single center. The sample size (104 patients) was adequate for detecting differences in primary outcomes.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study demonstrates that routine ENBD insertion does not improve clinical outcomes (recurrence, hospital stay) but increases procedural time and patient discomfort. Given the absence of benefit and presence of harm, routine use is unnecessary.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "no"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether routine insertion of an ENBD tube is necessary after endoscopic clearance of CBD stones in patients with choledocholithiasis-induced cholangitis. Key information to evaluate includes clinical outcomes (e.g., recurrence of cholangitis, hospital stay) and procedure-related factors (e.g., discomfort, procedure time) comparing ENBD and no-ENBD groups.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study is a prospective, randomized trial (moderate strength) at a single tertiary center (potential generalizability limitation).  
- Results showed **no significant differences** in recurrence rates of cholangitis (3.9% vs. 3.8%, *P* = 0.99) or hospital stay (7.9 days in both groups, *P* = 0.98).  
- ENBD insertion increased procedure time (26.2 vs. 22.7 minutes, *P* = 0.01) and patient discomfort (4.9 vs. 2.8, *P* = 0.02).  
- The authors concluded that routine ENBD provided no clinical benefit and caused additional burdens.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence indicates that routine ENBD does not improve clinical outcomes and is associated with procedural drawbacks. While the study is a single-center trial, the lack of benefit and clear adverse effects support the conclusion that routine ENBD is unnecessary.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: no**
