Question: Antral follicle assessment as a tool for predicting outcome in IVF--is it a better predictor than age and FSH?

**1. Question Analysis**
The core question is whether antral follicle assessment is a better predictor of in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes compared to maternal age and basal follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels. Key information to extract includes the comparative predictive value of antral follicle counts versus age and FSH, as well as the study's results supporting this comparison.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
The study analyzed 224 patients undergoing IVF, assessing antral follicles, age, and FSH levels. Key findings include:
- Higher clinical pregnancy rates in patients with >6 antral follicles (51%) compared to ≤6 (19%).
- After controlling for age and FSH, the association between higher antral follicles and increased pregnancy rates remained significant.
- Antral follicle assessment was found to be a better predictor of IVF outcomes than age or FSH levels alone.
- Increased cancellation rates were associated with advancing age, elevated FSH, and ≤6 antral follicles.

The evidence is robust as it accounts for confounding variables (age and FSH) and demonstrates a clear statistical significance in the predictive value of antral follicle counts.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the data presented, antral follicle assessment provides a more reliable prediction of IVF success than maternal age or basal FSH levels alone.

**4. Final Answer:**
**My final choice is: "yes"**
GPT selected: yes

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether antral follicle assessment is a better predictor of IVF outcomes than age and FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone). Key information to evaluate includes:  
- Whether the study directly compares antral follicle count, age, and FSH as predictors.  
- Statistical significance of antral follicle count compared to the other factors.  
- Whether the study concludes superiority of antral follicle assessment over age and FSH.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The abstract states:  
- Clinical pregnancy rates were significantly higher in patients with >6 antral follicles (51% vs. 19% in ≤6), even after controlling for age and FSH.  
- The cancellation rate was also significantly higher in the ≤6 antral follicle group (33% vs. 1%).  
- The study explicitly concludes: "Antral follicle assessment was a better predictor of IVF outcome than were age or FSH."  

The evidence is strong because:  
- The study controlled for age and FSH in multivariate analysis, isolating the effect of antral follicle count.  
- The results show statistically significant differences in both pregnancy and cancellation rates.  
- The conclusion directly answers the question, aligning with the data presented.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study provides clear evidence that antral follicle assessment outperforms age and FSH as a predictor of IVF outcomes. The controlled analysis and explicit conclusion support a "yes" answer.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**
Qwen selected: yes

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether antral follicle assessment (AFC) is a better predictor of IVF outcomes compared to age and basal FSH levels. Key information to evaluate includes the study's comparison of pregnancy/cancellation rates across AFC groups, age categories, and FSH levels, and whether AFC demonstrates superior predictive value after controlling for confounders.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study found significantly higher clinical pregnancy rates (51% vs. 19%) and lower cancellation rates (1% vs. 33%) in patients with AFC >6 vs. ≤6, even after adjusting for age and FSH.  
- AFC’s predictive power remained significant when age and FSH were controlled, suggesting independent utility.  
- Age and FSH alone correlated with outcomes but were less impactful than AFC, as stated explicitly in the abstract: *"Antral follicle assessment was a better predictor...than were age or FSH."*  
- The study design (prospective, n=224) supports reliability, though further validation in larger cohorts may strengthen generalizability.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence strongly supports AFC as a better predictor of IVF outcomes than age or FSH, based on higher pregnancy rates, lower cancellation rates, and statistical significance after controlling for confounders. The authors directly conclude AFC’s superiority.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**
DeepSeek selected: yes

Initial consensus: All models selected yes
