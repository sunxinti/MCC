**1. Question Analysis**

The core question seeks to determine whether the Retromandibular Transparotid Approach is a reliable surgical option for treating condylar fractures. Key information to extract from the abstract includes:

- **Safety and Reliability**: Assessing the incidence of complications and overall success of the surgical approach.
- **Outcomes**: Evaluating the restoration of occlusion, temporomandibular joint health, esthetic results, and absence of neurologic impairments.
- **Study Design and Sample Size**: Understanding the methodology, number of patients evaluated, and duration of follow-up to gauge the robustness of the findings.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**

The abstract presents a retrospective study involving 25 patients treated with the retromandibular transparotid approach for condylar fractures. Key findings include:

- **Restoration of Function**: Preinjury occlusion and temporomandibular joint health were successfully restored in most patients.
- **Esthetic Outcomes**: Both clinicians and patients deemed the esthetic results satisfactory.
- **Safety**: No permanent neurologic impairments or major postoperative complications were observed.

While the results are promising, the study's limitations include a relatively small sample size and its retrospective nature, which may affect the generalizability and strength of the evidence. However, within the context provided, the evidence supports the safety and effectiveness of the approach.

**3. Conclusion**

Based on the abstract, the Retromandibular Transparotid Approach demonstrated positive outcomes and a favorable safety profile in the treatment of condylar fractures. Despite limitations related to sample size and study design, the evidence presented supports the reliability of this surgical method.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether the retromandibular transparotid approach is a reliable surgical option for condylar fractures. Key information to evaluate includes the study's outcomes (e.g., occlusion restoration, TMJ health, aesthetics), complications, and the authors' conclusions.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Outcomes**: The study reports that preinjury occlusion and TMJ health were restored in "most patients," and aesthetic results were satisfactory to both clinicians and patients.  
- **Complications**: No permanent neurological impairments or major postoperative complications were observed.  
- **Study Design**: The study is retrospective with a small sample size (25 patients) and a minimum 1-year follow-up. While the results align with the authors' hypothesis of safety and reliability, the limited sample size and lack of a control group reduce the evidence's strength.  
- **Conclusion of the Study**: The authors explicitly state that the approach is "viable and safe" for condylar fractures.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence supports the retromandibular transparotid approach as reliable, given the absence of major complications and successful restoration of key outcomes in most patients. While the small sample size and retrospective design introduce limitations, the study's results and conclusion directly affirm reliability.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**
Qwen selected: yes

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether the retromandibular transparotid approach is reliable for surgical treatment of condylar fractures. Key information to evaluate includes postoperative outcomes (occlusion, TMJ function, complications) and evidence of safety (neurologic impairments, complications).

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The retrospective study (n=25) reported restored preinjury occlusion and TMJ health in most patients, satisfactory esthetic outcomes, and no permanent neurologic deficits or major complications.  
- Strengths: Follow-up ≥1 year, objective measures (computed tomograms), and clinical/patient-reported outcomes.  
- Limitations: Small sample size, retrospective design (risk of selection bias), and lack of comparison to other surgical approaches.  
- The abstract explicitly concludes the approach is "viable and safe," directly supporting reliability.

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence, while limited by sample size and study design, consistently demonstrates favorable outcomes and safety. The authors’ conclusion aligns with their hypothesis, supporting reliability. No contradictory findings are noted.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: yes**
DeepSeek selected: yes

Initial consensus: All models selected yes
