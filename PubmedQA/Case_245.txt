**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content:** The research question seeks to determine whether obesity serves as a risk factor for wheezing in adolescents.
- **Key Information to Look For:** Evidence linking obesity (measured via BMI and skinfold thickness) at the start of adolescence (age 11) to the prevalence, incidence, and persistence of wheezing by age 15.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results and Data:**
  - Obese individuals at age 11 had a 50% greater prevalence of wheezing at age 15 compared to eutrophic (normal weight) individuals (RR 1.53; 95% CI: 1.14-2.05).
  - Higher skinfold thickness at age 11 was associated with increased prevalence of wheezing at age 15 (p = .011).
  - Obesity was associated with persistent wheezing (RR 1.82; 95% CI: 1.30-2.54) after controlling for confounding factors.
  - No association was found between obesity and incident wheezing.
- **Strength and Reliability:** The study has a robust follow-up rate (85.7%) and uses standardized measures (ISAAC questionnaire, WHO BMI criteria). The relative risks and confidence intervals suggest statistically significant associations.
- **Relevance to the Question:** The evidence directly addresses the relationship between obesity and wheezing in adolescents, specifically highlighting prevalence and persistence, which are pertinent to establishing obesity as a risk factor.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the presented data, obesity at the start of adolescence is significantly associated with an increased prevalence and persistence of wheezing by age 15. This supports the role of obesity as a risk factor for wheezing in adolescents.

**4. Final Answer:**
**My final choice is: "yes"**
GPT selected: yes

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether obesity is a risk factor for wheezing in adolescents. Key information to evaluate includes:  
- The study's findings on obesity (BMI and skinfold thickness) and its association with wheezing prevalence, incidence, and persistence in adolescents aged 11–15.  
- Statistical significance and confounding variable adjustments in the results.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Prevalence**: Obese individuals at age 11 had a 50% higher prevalence of wheezing at age 15 (RR 1.53; 95% CI 1.14–2.05), which is statistically significant.  
- **Persistence**: Obesity at age 11 was associated with a 1.82-fold increased risk of persistent wheezing (RR 1.82; 95% CI 1.30–2.54), also statistically significant.  
- **Incidence**: Obesity was not linked to incident wheezing (new cases).  
- **Additional Evidence**: Higher skinfold thickness tertiles at age 11 correlated with increased wheezing prevalence at age 15 (p = 0.011).  
- **Confounding Factors**: Results were adjusted for confounders, strengthening the validity of the associations.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study provides statistically significant evidence that obesity at the start of adolescence (age 11) is associated with increased prevalence and persistence of wheezing at age 15. While obesity does not appear to cause new wheezing cases (incidence), it worsens existing or ongoing symptoms. Since the question broadly asks if obesity is a risk factor for wheezing (not limited to incidence), the answer is **yes**.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether obesity is a risk factor for wheezing in adolescents. Key information to evaluate includes the study's findings on the association between obesity (measured by BMI and skinfold thickness) and wheezing prevalence, incidence, or persistence in adolescents aged 11–15 years.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study reports a **50% greater prevalence of wheezing at 15 years** among individuals obese at 11 years (RR 1.53; 95% CI: 1.14–2.05), with a dose-response relationship observed for skinfold thickness.  
- **Persistent wheezing risk** was significantly higher in obese individuals (RR 1.82; 95% CI: 1.30–2.54).  
- However, **no association** was found between obesity and **incident wheezing** (new cases during follow-up).  
- The study design (birth cohort with 85.7% follow-up), use of validated tools (ISAAC questionnaire, WHO BMI criteria), and adjustment for confounders strengthen reliability.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence strongly supports obesity as a risk factor for **prevalence and persistence** of wheezing in adolescents, though not for new-onset wheezing. Since the question broadly asks about "risk factor" (not specifically incidence), the affirmative association with prevalence/persistence justifies a "yes" answer.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: yes**
DeepSeek selected: yes

Initial consensus: All models selected yes
