Question: Is renal warm ischemia over 30 minutes during laparoscopic partial nephrectomy possible?

----- GPT's initial response -----
GPT is reasoning the answer...


**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content:** The question seeks to determine if renal warm ischemia lasting over 30 minutes is feasible during laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN).
- **Key Information to Identify:** Instances or evidence in the abstract where LPN was performed with warm ischemia times exceeding 30 minutes.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results:** The study involved 18 patients who underwent LPN with warm ischemia times exceeding 30 minutes.
- **Data Reliability:** While the sample size is small (18 patients), the study systematically evaluated kidney damage markers and renal function over time, providing specific data points and statistical significance.
- **Relevance:** Directly addresses the feasibility of achieving warm ischemia times over 30 minutes during LPN by reporting actual cases where this was done.

**3. Conclusion**
- The abstract clearly indicates that LPN procedures were successfully performed with warm ischemia times exceeding 30 minutes, although this duration was associated with kidney damage. Therefore, it is possible to achieve warm ischemia over 30 minutes during LPN, albeit with potential adverse effects.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether renal warm ischemia exceeding 30 minutes during laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) is possible. The key focus is on the feasibility of achieving such prolonged warm ischemia during the procedure, based on the study's data.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The abstract explicitly states that 18 patients underwent LPN with warm ischemia times **>30 minutes**, and the study evaluated their outcomes. While the results showed kidney damage (elevated proteinuria, tubular enzymes, and reduced scintigraphy values postoperatively), these markers returned to normal ranges at 1 year. The study confirms that warm ischemia >30 minutes was intentionally performed in these patients. The conclusion advises minimizing ischemia to ≤30 minutes due to partial irreversibility of damage, but this addresses **safety**, not feasibility.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study explicitly reports that LPN with warm ischemia >30 minutes was performed in 18 patients, confirming that it is **possible**. The adverse outcomes (damage) and recommendations to avoid prolonged ischemia do not negate the procedural feasibility. The question asks about possibility, not advisability.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**
Qwen selected: yes

DeepSeek is reasoning the answer...

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether renal warm ischemia exceeding 30 minutes during laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) is feasible or tolerable. Key information to evaluate includes postoperative renal damage, functional recovery (e.g., glomerular filtration rate [GFR], scintigraphy), and the study's conclusions about reversibility of damage.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study included 18 patients with warm ischemia >30 minutes.  
- While serum markers (creatinine, cystatin C) and GFR returned to normal by 1 year, renal scintigraphy showed persistent functional deficits in the operated kidney (42.8% at 12 months vs. 48.35% preoperatively, *p=0.001*).  
- The authors explicitly state that damage from ischemia >30 minutes is **only partially reversible** and recommend limiting ischemia to ≤30 minutes.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study confirms that warm ischemia >30 minutes during LPN is **technically possible** (performed in 18 patients) but causes irreversible renal damage. Since the question focuses on feasibility ("possible") rather than safety, the answer is "yes." However, the authors strongly advise against it due to suboptimal outcomes.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: yes**
DeepSeek selected: yes

Initial consensus: All models selected yes
