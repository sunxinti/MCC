**1. Question Analysis**
   
The core question is whether the relationship between marital status, living arrangements, and mortality varies by gender. Key information to look for in the abstract includes:
- Differences in mortality benefits of being married between men and women.
- The impact of different living arrangements (e.g., living alone, living with a partner) on mortality risks for different genders.
- Age-related variations in these associations.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
   
The study utilized a large longitudinal dataset from the Swiss National Cohort, including over 2.4 million residents aged over 44 years, with mortality data spanning from 1990 to 2005. The findings indicate:
- Being married provides a stronger mortality benefit for men compared to women.
- After adjusting for living arrangements, the gender differences in mortality associated with marital status disappear.
- Specific living arrangements, such as men being divorced or single and living alone, exhibit higher mortality risks, whereas for women, being single and living with a partner is associated with higher mortality.
- The impact of marital status on mortality diminishes in older age groups.
   
The large sample size and longitudinal design enhance the reliability and strength of the evidence. The findings are directly relevant to the question, demonstrating variations in how marital status and living arrangements influence mortality differently for men and women.

**3. Conclusion**
   
Based on the study's findings, there is clear evidence that the association between marital status, living arrangements, and mortality does vary by gender. While being married benefits men more in terms of mortality risk, adjusting for living arrangements reveals that these gender differences diminish, highlighting the complexity of these relationships.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether the association between marital status/living arrangements and mortality varies by gender. Key elements to assess:  
- Differences in mortality risks between genders for marital statuses (married, widowed, divorced, single).  
- Impact of living arrangements (alone vs. with others) on these differences.  
- Whether results are consistent across age groups.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study found that **married men had a stronger mortality benefit compared to women**, indicating an initial gender difference.  
- After adjusting for **living arrangements**, the gender difference in mortality by marital status **disappeared**, suggesting living arrangements mediate the effect.  
- Stratified analysis showed distinct patterns:  
  - **Men (45–64 years)**: Highest mortality in divorced/single individuals **living alone** (HR ~1.67–1.72).  
  - **Women (45–64 years)**: Highest mortality in single women **living with a partner** (HR 1.70).  
- In older age groups (>80 years), marital status had less impact, but gender differences in mortality risks still depended on living arrangements.  

The evidence is robust, using a large longitudinal cohort (n=2.4 million) and adjusted for education/socioeconomic factors. The results directly address gender differences and explicitly link them to living arrangements.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study confirms that the association between marital status/living arrangements and mortality **varies by gender**. The mortality risks differ not only by marital status but also by how living arrangements interact with gender (e.g., single men living alone vs. single women cohabiting). The disappearance of gender differences after adjusting for living arrangements further supports that the association is gender-specific. Thus, the answer is "yes."

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether the association between marital status, living arrangement, and mortality varies by gender. Key elements to evaluate include gender-specific mortality risks across marital statuses (married, widowed, divorced, single) and living arrangements (living alone vs. with others), particularly whether these relationships differ between men and women.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study found that while men initially appeared to benefit more from marriage, adjusting for living arrangements eliminated this gender difference.  
- Mortality risks differed by gender:  
  - For men aged 45–64, divorced/single men living alone had the highest mortality (HR 1.72 and 1.67).  
  - For women in the same age group, single women living with a partner had the highest mortality (HR 1.70).  
- In older age groups, marital status had less impact, but gender-specific patterns persisted in younger/middle-aged groups.  
- The abstract explicitly states that living arrangements explain gender differences in mortality risks tied to marital status, confirming that the association does vary by gender.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence robustly supports gender-specific variations in mortality risks linked to marital status and living arrangements. The study’s large sample size, longitudinal design, and explicit conclusions about gender differences strengthen reliability.
