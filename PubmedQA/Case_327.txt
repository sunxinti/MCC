Question: Risk factors for avascular necrosis of bone in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: is there a role for antiphospholipid antibodies?

**1. Question Analysis**
The core question seeks to determine whether antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) are risk factors for avascular necrosis of bone (AVN) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), while accounting for the use of corticosteroids. Key information includes the presence of aPL (IgM and IgG anticardiolipin antibodies and lupus anticoagulant) and their association with AVN in SLE patients after adjusting for corticosteroid use.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
The research involved a cohort of 265 SLE patients followed over two decades. Eleven patients developed AVN, resulting in a 4% prevalence. The study compared the presence of individual aPL and their combinations between patients with AVN and two control groups matched for age, sex, ethnicity, disease duration, and organ involvement. The findings revealed no significant differences in aPL presence between the AVN group and controls. Additionally, the abstract explicitly states that after adjusting for corticosteroid use, no link between aPL and AVN was found.

**3. Conclusion**
The study provides evidence that antiphospholipid antibodies do not play a significant role in the development of AVN in SLE patients when corticosteroid use is accounted for. The methodology appears sound with appropriate matching and adjustments, lending reliability to the conclusion.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) play a role in the risk of avascular necrosis (AVN) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Key information to assess includes:  
- The study's findings on aPL (IgM/IgG anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant) and AVN in SLE patients.  
- Whether the analysis adjusted for corticosteroid use, a known risk factor for AVN.  
- Statistical significance of associations between aPL and AVN.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The study analyzed 265 SLE patients, identifying 11 cases of AVN (4% prevalence). Patients with AVN were matched to controls for age, sex, ethnicity, disease duration, and organ involvement. The key results:  
- No significant differences in individual or combined aPL levels between the AVN group and control groups.  
- After adjusting for corticosteroid use (a major confounder), no link between aPL and AVN was found.  

The studyâ€™s methodology (matching for confounders and adjusting for steroids) strengthens the reliability of the conclusion. The small number of AVN cases (11) might limit statistical power, but the abstract explicitly states no significant differences were found.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence directly addresses the question and shows no association between aPL and AVN in SLE patients, even after accounting for corticosteroid use. The results support rejecting aPL as a risk factor in this context.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "no"**
Qwen selected: no

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) are a risk factor for avascular necrosis (AVN) in SLE patients, specifically after adjusting for corticosteroid use. Key elements to evaluate include the study's adjustment for steroids, comparison of aPL status between AVN and control groups, and statistical significance of findings.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study analyzed 265 SLE patients, identifying 11 with AVN (4% prevalence). Cases were matched with controls for confounders (age, sex, ethnicity, disease duration, organ involvement).  
- Results showed **no significant differences** in aPL (IgM/IgG anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant) between AVN patients and controls, even after adjusting for corticosteroid use.  
- The conclusion explicitly states no demonstrable link between aPL and AVN after steroid adjustment.  
- Limitations include a small AVN cohort (n=11), which may reduce statistical power, but the study directly addresses the question with rigorous matching and adjustment for steroids, a major confounding variable.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study provides evidence against aPL as a risk factor for AVN in SLE patients when corticosteroid use is accounted for. While the small sample size introduces some uncertainty, the explicit negative result ("unable to show a link") supports a "no" answer.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: no**
DeepSeek selected: no
