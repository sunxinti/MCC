**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content:** The primary question investigates whether well-differentiated (w-d) small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can be classified as clinically early cancer.
- **Key Information to Identify:** The study compares outcomes between patients with well-differentiated HCCs and those with less differentiated (l-d) HCCs, focusing on factors like disease-free survival, recurrence rates, and pathological features.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results and Data:** The study followed 76 patients with solitary small HCCs (≤3 cm) for at least two years post-hepatectomy. The key findings include:
  - W-d HCCs had significantly lower incidences of fibrous capsule formation compared to l-d HCCs.
  - No significant differences were found in intrahepatic metastasis or portal vein invasion between the two groups.
  - Disease-free survival rates were not significantly different between patients with w-d and l-d HCCs.
  - Tumor volume doubling time suggested the presence of minute cancerous foci at the time of operation.
- **Strength and Reliability:** The study provides comparative data between the two groups, but the sample size for w-d HCCs is relatively small (10 patients), which may limit the generalizability of the findings.
- **Relevance to the Question:** The lack of difference in disease-free survival suggests that w-d HCCs do not exhibit characteristics of early-stage cancer compared to l-d HCCs.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the evidence presented, well-differentiated HCCs do not demonstrate improved disease-free survival and therefore are not indicative of clinically early cancer.

**4. Final Answer**
**My final choice is: "no"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether well-differentiated (w-d) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) qualifies as "clinically early cancer." The key evidence to evaluate includes differences in prognosis (disease-free survival), histological features, and recurrence patterns between w-d HCC (Edmondson grade I) and less differentiated (l-d) HCC (higher grades).  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Histological Findings**: W-d HCCs had lower fibrous capsule formation (P<0.01) but similar rates of intrahepatic metastasis, portal vein invasion, and disease-free survival compared to l-d HCC.  
- **Survival Analysis**: The study explicitly states there was **no significant difference in disease-free survival** between the two groups, a critical clinical outcome measure.  
- **Tumor Biology**: Recurrent tumor analysis suggested preexisting minute foci at surgery, implying early dissemination even in w-d HCC.  

The study’s conclusion directly addresses the question: "W-d HCCs were clinically demonstrated not to be early cancer" due to equivalent survival outcomes. This conclusion is supported by robust survival data and histopathological evidence of early microscopic invasion.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence strongly indicates that well-differentiated HCC does **not** qualify as clinically early cancer because its prognosis (disease-free survival) is no better than that of less differentiated HCC. Histological differences (e.g., fibrous capsule) do not translate to clinical advantages in survival, and microscopic invasion persists.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether well-differentiated (w-d) small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) qualifies as clinically early cancer. Key points to evaluate include histological features (e.g., capsule formation, metastasis, vascular invasion), disease-free survival outcomes, and evidence of pre-existing microscopic foci at resection.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Histological Findings**: W-d HCCs showed lower fibrous capsule formation but no significant differences in intrahepatic metastasis or portal vein invasion compared to less differentiated (l-d) HCCs. Microscopic cancer infiltration was observed in w-d HCCs.  
- **Survival Outcomes**: No significant difference in disease-free survival between w-d and l-d HCC groups.  
- **Recurrence Analysis**: Tumor volume doubling time in recurrent foci suggested pre-existing microscopic cancer at the time of resection, implying early metastatic potential even in w-d HCCs.  
- **Conclusion of the Study**: The authors explicitly state w-d HCCs are **not** clinically early cancers due to comparable recurrence rates and survival outcomes with l-d HCCs.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence indicates w-d HCCs do not behave as "early cancer" because they share similar recurrence and survival patterns with l-d HCCs, despite histological differences. The presence of microscopic infiltration and pre-existing metastases further supports this conclusion.

**My final choice is: "no"**
