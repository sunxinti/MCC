Question: Is vitamin D deficiency a feature of pediatric celiac disease?

**1. Question Analysis**
The core question is whether vitamin D deficiency is a characteristic of pediatric celiac disease (CD). Key information to look for includes comparisons of vitamin D levels between children with CD and those without, accounting for potential confounders such as obesity and seasonal variations.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
The study compared serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels in prepubertal children with CD (n=24) versus non-CD children (n=50). Overall, no significant difference in vitamin D levels was found between the two groups (27.58 vs. 26.20 nmol/L, p=0.59). When subdivided by obesity, non-obese CD patients had higher vitamin D levels than obese non-CD children, but there was no difference between non-obese CD and non-CD children. The study controlled for confounders like BMI and season, enhancing the reliability of the findings. However, the small sample size may limit the generalizability of the results.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the evidence, vitamin D deficiency does not appear to be a feature of pediatric celiac disease when controlling for body mass index. The lack of significant differences in vitamin D levels between CD and non-CD children suggests that CD may not inherently be associated with vitamin D deficiency in this population.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether vitamin D deficiency is a characteristic feature of pediatric celiac disease (CD) in prepubertal children. Key information to evaluate includes:  
- Comparison of serum 25(OH)D levels between children with CD and healthy controls.  
- Adjustments for confounders like obesity and season.  
- Whether differences in vitamin D levels are statistically significant.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The study compared 24 CD patients (undiagnosed, not on a gluten-free diet) to 50 non-CD controls. Key results:  
- **No overall difference** in 25(OH)D levels between CD and non-CD groups (p = 0.59).  
- When stratified by obesity:  
  - Non-obese CD patients had higher 25(OH)D than obese controls (likely due to obesity’s known association with lower vitamin D, not CD itself).  
  - Non-obese CD patients had similar levels to non-obese controls (p = 0.52).  
- Season and BMI were not confounders.  
- The abstract explicitly states: *“no difference in 25(OH)D levels between normal children and those with CD when adjusted for body mass index.”*  

The evidence is reliable as it directly measures 25(OH)D levels and adjusts for relevant variables. The results contradict the hypothesis that CD inherently causes vitamin D deficiency.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study found no significant difference in vitamin D levels between children with CD and controls when accounting for BMI. The observed subgroup differences (e.g., non-obese CD vs. obese controls) are likely due to obesity’s effect on vitamin D, not CD itself. Thus, vitamin D deficiency is **not** a consistent feature of pediatric CD in this study.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether vitamin D deficiency is a feature of pediatric celiac disease (CD). The study compares serum 25(OH)D levels in prepubertal children with CD (n=24) and non-CD controls (n=50), adjusting for variables like obesity and season. Key information includes the lack of overall difference in 25(OH)D levels between groups and the role of body mass index (BMI) in subgroup analyses.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Results**: No significant difference in 25(OH)D levels between CD and non-CD children (27.58 vs. 26.20 ng/mL, p=0.59). Subgroup analysis showed non-obese CD patients had higher 25(OH)D levels than obese controls (28.39 vs. 21.58 ng/mL, p=0.009), but no difference between non-obese CD and non-obese controls (28.39 vs. 30.64 ng/mL, p=0.52).  
- **Strength/Reliability**: Retrospective design and small sample size (n=24 CD) limit generalizability, but exclusion of confounders (e.g., supplementation, metabolic disorders) strengthens internal validity. The adjusted analysis for BMI and season (p=0.7) supports robustness.  
- **Relevance**: Directly addresses vitamin D status in pediatric CD, concluding no deficiency when adjusted for BMI.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study demonstrates no inherent vitamin D deficiency in pediatric CD patients compared to controls when accounting for BMI. Observed differences were attributable to obesity, not CD itself. Thus, vitamin D deficiency is not a consistent feature of pediatric CD based on this evidence.
