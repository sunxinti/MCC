Question: Perioperative care in an animal model for training in abdominal surgery: is it necessary a preoperative fasting?

----- GPT's initial response -----

**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content:** The research question investigates whether preoperative fasting is necessary in perioperative care for an animal model (rabbits) used for training in abdominal surgery.
- **Key Information to Identify:** The study's findings on the effects of preoperative fasting durations on surgical outcomes, blood glucose levels, gastric content post-surgery, and overall morbidity and mortality rates.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results and Data:** 
  - Rabbits underwent varying preoperative fasting periods (minimum 2 hours for absolute fasting, up to 20.5 hours for solids).
  - Post-surgical outcomes showed no gastric content present at the end of surgery despite extended fasting.
  - Blood glucose levels increased from an initial mean of 199.4 mg/dl to 326.1 mg/dl post-surgery.
  - Low mortality rate (3.125%) and morbidity rate (6.25%).
  - A moderate negative correlation was observed between fasting duration for liquids and solids and the quantity of solid gastric content.
- **Strength and Reliability:** The study involved a sample size of 32 rabbits, which provides a reasonable preliminary insight but may benefit from larger sample sizes for more robust conclusions.
- **Relevance:** The evidence directly addresses the necessity of preoperative fasting by demonstrating that extended fasting did not lead to hypoglycemia or residual gastric content, supporting the feasibility of performing surgery without mandatory fasting.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the study's findings, extended preoperative fasting does not appear to be necessary for rabbits undergoing abdominal surgery training. The absence of gastric content post-surgery and the lack of hypoglycemia support the conclusion that preoperative fasting may be unnecessary in this animal model.

**4. Final Answer:**
**My final choice is: "no"**
GPT selected: no

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether preoperative fasting is necessary in a rabbit model for surgical training. Key points to evaluate:  
- The study's findings on gastric content and blood glucose after different fasting periods.  
- The abstract's conclusion stating "no need of pre-operative fasting" and absence of hypoglycemia.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Gastric Content:** All rabbits had no gastric content post-surgery despite varying fasting durations (up to 20.5 hours for solids). This suggests fasting may not be critical to prevent aspiration, as even shorter fasting periods (e.g., 2 hours) eliminated gastric content.  
- **Blood Glucose:** Serum glucose increased significantly (199.4 mg/dl to 326.1 mg/dl) post-surgery, indicating no hypoglycemia despite extended fasting. This contradicts concerns about fasting-induced hypoglycemia.  
- **Morbidity/Mortality:** Low rates (6.25% morbidity, 3.125% mortality) suggest fasting did not worsen outcomes.  
- **Abstract Conclusion:** Directly states "no need of pre-operative fasting," aligning with the data.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study’s results show that even short fasting periods (e.g., 2 hours) eliminated gastric content, and extended fasting did not cause hypoglycemia. The authors explicitly conclude fasting is unnecessary. Thus, the evidence strongly supports "no."  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "no"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether preoperative fasting is necessary in perioperative care for rabbits used as an abdominal surgery training model. Key information to evaluate includes the study's findings on fasting duration, gastric content post-resection, and outcomes like morbidity/mortality or metabolic effects (e.g., blood glucose levels).  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- The study tested rabbits with varying fasting periods (2–20.5 hours) and found **all animals retained gastric content** post-surgery, regardless of fasting duration.  
- Blood glucose levels increased post-surgery (199.4 mg/dl to 326.1 mg/dl), with no hypoglycemia observed despite prolonged fasting.  
- The abstract explicitly states "no need of pre-operative fasting" and emphasizes rabbits tolerated extended fasting without adverse metabolic effects.  
- Mortality (3.125%) and morbidity (6.25%) rates were low, supporting the safety of the protocol without fasting.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence strongly indicates preoperative fasting is **not necessary** in this model. The retained gastric content despite fasting and absence of hypoglycemia suggest fasting does not improve safety or outcomes. The authors directly conclude fasting is unnecessary.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: no**
DeepSeek selected: no

Initial consensus: All models selected no
