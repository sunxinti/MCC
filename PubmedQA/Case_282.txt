Question: Double reading of barium enemas: is it necessary?

**1. Question Analysis**
The core question is whether implementing a double reading protocol for barium enemas is necessary. Key aspects to consider include whether double reading enhances diagnostic accuracy, impacts clinical outcomes positively, or if the additional effort/resources justify its use.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Increased Positives:** Double reading raised the number of positive examinations from 249 to 315.
- **Sensitivity:** Remained unchanged at 76.3%, indicating no improvement in detecting true positives.
- **Specificity:** Decreased from 91.0% to 86.4%, leading to more false-positive results.
- **Clinical Impact:** Altered clinical treatment in 9.9% of patients, but without enhancing overall sensitivity.
- **Efficiency:** The second reading added an average of 3.3 minutes per examination.
- **Agreement Metrics:** Kappa value decreased, indicating reduced agreement with endoscopic results.
- **Overall Conclusion from Abstract:** Double reading does not improve sensitivity for detecting polyps and increases the false-positive rate, despite being feasible.

The evidence suggests that while double reading may identify more positive cases, it does not enhance the ability to detect true positives and instead results in more false positives, potentially leading to unnecessary treatments or further investigations.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the evidence, double reading does not provide a significant benefit in terms of sensitivity and introduces a higher rate of false positives. The slight clinical impact may not justify the increased resources and potential for unnecessary interventions.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether double reading of barium enemas is necessary. The key points to evaluate are the study's findings on sensitivity, specificity, clinical impact, and feasibility. The abstract highlights that double reading increased positive results but also reduced specificity, leading to more false positives. The conclusion states that double reading does not improve sensitivity for polyps but increases the false-positive rate.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Sensitivity**: The first reader and combined readings had identical sensitivity (76.3%) for detecting lesions, including adenocarcinomas (100% sensitivity in both). Thus, double reading did not improve lesion detection.  
- **Specificity**: Specificity decreased significantly with combined readings (91.0% vs. 86.4%), leading to more false positives.  
- **Clinical Impact**: While double reading altered treatment in 9.9% of cases, this may reflect overdiagnosis due to the higher false-positive rate.  
- **Feasibility**: The process added only 3.3 minutes per exam, but the trade-off between potential clinical benefit and reduced specificity is critical.  
- **Abstract Conclusion**: Explicitly states that double reading does not improve sensitivity and increases the false-positive rate.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study demonstrates that double reading does not enhance sensitivity for detecting lesions (the primary goal of barium enema interpretation) and compromises specificity. While it increased the number of positive results, this came at the cost of more false positives, which could lead to unnecessary interventions. The abstract’s conclusion directly answers the question by stating that double reading is not beneficial for improving sensitivity. Thus, the evidence strongly supports "no."

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether double reading of barium enemas is necessary. The key information to evaluate includes:  
- Whether double reading improves diagnostic sensitivity for clinically significant findings (polyps/carcinomas ≥5 mm).  
- Impact on specificity (false-positive rate).  
- Clinical implications (e.g., treatment alterations) and feasibility (e.g., time required).  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Sensitivity**: Combined readings did **not** improve sensitivity for detecting all lesions (76.3% for both first and combined readings). However, sensitivity for adenocarcinomas alone was 100%.  
- **Specificity**: Decreased significantly from 91.0% (first reading) to 86.4% (combined), indicating more false positives.  
- **Clinical Impact**: 98 patients (9.9%) had potential treatment alterations, but this includes both true and false positives.  
- **Agreement**: Kappa values decreased from 61.8 to 52.9, suggesting reduced diagnostic consistency.  
- **Feasibility**: Second readings took 3.3 minutes on average, but the increased false positives and unchanged sensitivity undermine clinical utility.  

The study’s conclusion explicitly states that double reading does not improve sensitivity for polyps and increases false positives.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence shows that double reading does not enhance sensitivity for detecting polyps/carcinomas and reduces specificity. While it increases detection of positive findings, these include false positives, which may lead to unnecessary interventions. The lack of sensitivity improvement and reduced agreement between readers support the conclusion that double reading is **not necessary**.
