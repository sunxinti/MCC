Question: Does minimal access major surgery in the newborn hurt less?

----- GPT's initial response -----
GPT is reasoning the answer...


**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content:** The primary question seeks to determine whether minimal access major surgery (MAS) in newborns results in less postoperative pain compared to conventional open surgery.
- **Key Information to Look For:** Comparison of postoperative opioid consumption between MAS and conventional surgery in neonates, specifically focusing on conditions like esophageal atresia (EA) and congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH).

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results:** The retrospective cohort study included 24 MAS patients matched with 48 control patients. Opioid consumption was measured at multiple postoperative time points (12, 24, 48 hours, and 7 days). The study found no significant differences in cumulative opioid doses between MAS patients and controls for both EA and CDH groups at any of the measured time points. Additionally, postoperative pain scores did not differ between the two groups.
- **Strength and Reliability:** The study employs a matched cohort design with a reasonable sample size for this specific patient population. Opioid dosing was based on validated pain scores, enhancing the reliability of the measurements.
- **Relevance to the Question:** The evidence directly addresses the research question by comparing opioid consumption, a proxy for pain, between MAS and conventional surgery in newborns.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the presented evidence, minimal access major surgery in newborns does not result in reduced postoperative pain compared to conventional open surgery, as there were no significant differences in opioid consumption or pain scores between the two groups.

**4. Final Answer**
**My final choice is: "no"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether minimal access surgery (MAS) in newborns causes less pain compared to conventional surgery. The key focus is on whether MAS is associated with reduced postoperative pain, as indicated by lower opioid consumption. The study specifically examines neonates undergoing surgery for esophageal atresia (EA) or congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH).  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The abstract states that the study compared cumulative opioid doses between MAS and conventional surgery groups in neonates with EA or CDH. The results showed no statistically significant differences in opioid consumption at any time point (12, 24, 48 hours, or 7 days postoperatively). For example, at 24 hours post-surgery, CDH patients in the MAS group had median opioid doses of 0.84 mg/kg (IQR 0.61–1.83) versus 1.06 mg/kg (IQR 0.60–1.36) in controls (p=1.0). Similarly, EA patients had nearly identical doses (0.48 vs. 0.49 mg/kg, p=0.83). The abstract explicitly concludes that MAS was **not associated with less cumulative opioid use**, and pain scores also showed no differences.  

The study design (retrospective cohort with matched controls) and use of validated pain scores (VAS, COMFORT) add credibility. The lack of statistical significance across all time points strongly supports the conclusion that MAS does not reduce pain in this population.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence clearly shows no difference in opioid consumption or pain scores between MAS and conventional surgery in neonates with EA or CDH. Since the study directly addresses the question and finds no benefit, the answer is **"no"**.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether minimal access major surgery (MAS) in newborns causes less postoperative pain compared to conventional surgery. The key focus is on pain reduction, measured indirectly via opioid consumption and validated pain scores. The abstract evaluates neonates undergoing MAS for esophageal atresia (EA) and congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) versus matched controls receiving conventional surgery.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The study compared cumulative opioid doses and pain scores between MAS and conventional surgery groups. Results showed no significant differences in opioid consumption at any postoperative time point (12h, 24h, 48h, 7d) for both EA and CDH patients. Pain scores (using VAS and COMFORT scales) also did not differ. The study design included matched controls, validated pain assessment tools, and statistical testing (Mann-Whitney), supporting reliability. However, the retrospective nature and small sample size (24 MAS vs. 48 controls) may limit generalizability. The evidence directly addresses the question by demonstrating no reduction in opioid use or pain scores with MAS.

**3. Conclusion**  
The study provides robust evidence that MAS does not reduce postoperative pain in neonates, as reflected by equivalent opioid requirements and pain scores compared to conventional surgery. Thus, the answer is **"no"**, as the findings contradict the hypothesis that MAS causes less pain in newborns.
