Question: Prognosis of low-tone sudden deafness - does it inevitably progress to Meniere's disease?

**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Question:** Does low-tone sudden deafness (SD) inevitably progress to Meniere's disease?
- **Key Information to Look For:** The rate at which patients with low-tone SD develop Meniere's disease, comparison with high-tone SD, and any indications of progression patterns from the abstract.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results and Data:** Out of 177 patients with low-tone SD without vertigo, 83 experienced recurrent hearing loss, and 15 of these developed vertigo. Among patients with low-tone SD accompanied by vertigo, 2 out of 3 were confirmed to have Meniere's disease.
- **Strength and Reliability:** The study is a retrospective case review with a sample size of 184 patients from a single university hospital. While providing valuable insights, the retrospective nature and single-center data may limit generalizability.
- **Relevance to the Question:** The findings directly address the progression of low-tone SD to Meniere's disease, indicating that not all patients with low-tone SD develop Meniere's disease.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the study, low-tone sudden deafness does not inevitably progress to Meniere's disease, as only a subset of patients developed Meniere's, and the progression rate was similar to that of high-tone SD.

**4. Final Answer**
**My final choice is: "no"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether low-tone sudden deafness (SD) inevitably progresses to Meniere's disease. Key points to assess:  
- Whether all low-tone SD cases progress to Meniere's disease.  
- Evidence from the study's data on progression rates and endolymphatic hydrops.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Progression Data**: Among 184 patients with low-tone SD:  
  - 15/83 patients with recurrent low-tone SD (without initial vertigo) developed vertigo, but only 2/15 were diagnosed with Meniere’s.  
  - 2/3 patients with low-tone SD + vertigo who had recurrent hearing loss were later confirmed to have Meniere’s.  
  - The study explicitly states "no difference in rate of progress from SD to Meniere’s disease" between low-tone and high-tone SD groups.  
- **ECochG Findings**: The -SP/AP ratio (indicator of endolymphatic hydrops) was smaller in single-episode groups, suggesting not all low-tone SD patients have hydrops.  
- **Conclusion of the Study**: Directly states, "not all low-tone SD patients suffered from endolymphatic hydrops even if they had vertigo attack at the onset," implying progression to Meniere’s is not inevitable.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study provides evidence that progression from low-tone SD to Meniere’s disease is not universal. Only a subset of patients developed Meniere’s, and progression rates were similar to high-tone SD (which is not a known precursor). The abstract explicitly rejects inevitability. Thus, the answer is **"no"**.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether low-tone sudden deafness (SD) inevitably progresses to Meniere's disease. Key information to evaluate includes:  
- Progression rates of low-tone SD to Meniere's disease.  
- Comparison between low-tone SD and other groups (e.g., high-tone SD, Meniere’s disease).  
- Evidence of endolymphatic hydrops (a hallmark of Meniere’s) in low-tone SD patients.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Data from the study**:  
  - 15/177 low-tone SD patients (without initial vertigo) developed vertigo; progression to Meniere’s was not explicitly quantified.  
  - 2/3 patients with low-tone SD *and vertigo* developed Meniere’s.  
  - No significant difference in progression rates between low-tone and high-tone SD groups.  
  - ECochG results (-SP/AP ratios) showed lower values in single-episode low-tone SD vs. recurrent/Meniere’s groups, suggesting not all low-tone SD cases involve endolymphatic hydrops.  
- **Conclusion of the study**: Not all low-tone SD patients have endolymphatic hydrops, even with vertigo. ECochG can help predict prognosis.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence indicates that **only a subset** of low-tone SD patients progress to Meniere’s disease (e.g., those with recurrent episodes or vertigo). The study explicitly states progression is not inevitable, supported by ECochG findings distinguishing transient cases from those with hydrops.
