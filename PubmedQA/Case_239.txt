**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content:** The question seeks to determine whether a surgeon's prior experience affects their ability to perform transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).
- **Key Information to Identify:** Levels of surgeon experience, metrics of surgical ability (e.g., tissue resected per minute), and any associated outcomes or complications.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results and Data:** 
  - Surgeons were categorized into three groups based on experience: 25 TURPs (Group I), 50 TURPs (Group II), and a senior urologist with extensive TURP experience (Group III).
  - The senior urologist (Group III) resected tissue at a rate approximately four times higher per minute compared to the less experienced surgeons (Groups I and II).
  - There were no significant differences among the groups regarding irrigation fluid used, absorbed, or complications like TUR syndrome.
- **Strength and Reliability:** 
  - The study was randomized, enhancing the reliability of the comparative results between different experience levels.
  - The significant difference in tissue resection rate suggests a strong association between experience and surgical efficiency.
- **Relevance to the Question:** 
  - The increased resection rate in more experienced surgeons directly addresses the question of whether experience influences the ability to perform TURP.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the evidence, a surgeon's previous experience significantly enhances their ability to perform TURP more efficiently, as evidenced by the higher rate of tissue resection. However, this increased efficiency does not translate to differences in complications, which remain consistent across experience levels.

**4. Final Answer:**
**My final choice is: "yes"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether a surgeon's prior experience affects their ability to perform TURP. Key factors to evaluate include surgical outcomes (e.g., tissue resected, procedure duration) and complications. The abstract provides data on resected tissue weight, procedure efficiency, irrigation use, fluid absorption, hemoglobin levels, and complication rates (TUR syndrome).

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Surgical Outcomes**: The senior urologist (Group III) resected **four times more tissue per minute** than Groups I and II, indicating greater efficiency. This suggests experience improves the ability to perform the procedure effectively.  
- **Complications**: The incidence of TUR syndrome (a major complication) was similar across all groups (6% total, no statistical difference). This implies experience does not significantly influence complication risk.  
- **Procedure Safety**: Metrics like irrigation fluid absorption and hemoglobin levels showed no differences between groups, further supporting that complications are not experience-dependent.  

The study highlights that experience enhances surgical efficiency (tissue resection rate) but does not reduce complications. The question focuses on the "ability to perform TURP," which could encompass both technical skill and outcomes. The significant disparity in tissue resection strongly supports that experience influences procedural efficacy, even if complication rates remain unchanged.

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence shows that surgeon experience significantly impacts procedural efficiency (more tissue resected per minute), which is a key aspect of surgical ability. While complications are unaffected by experience, the core ability to perform the procedure effectively (e.g., tissue resection adequacy) is improved with experience. Thus, the answer is **"yes"**.

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether a surgeon's prior experience impacts their ability to perform TURP. Key factors include resection efficiency (e.g., tissue resected per minute) and complication rates.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Resection Efficiency**: Group III (senior urologist) resected four times more tissue per minute than Groups I and II, indicating experience improves procedural speed and tissue removal efficiency.  
- **Complications**: No significant differences in irrigation fluid absorption, hemoglobin/sodium changes, or TUR syndrome incidence (6% overall, no intergroup variation).  
- **Relevance**: The study directly links experience to improved resection efficiency but not to complication reduction.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence confirms that experience enhances resection efficiency (critical for preventing incomplete resections and secondary procedures) but does not affect complication rates. Since the question focuses on "ability to perform TURP," which includes technical proficiency (resection rate), the answer is "yes."  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: yes**
DeepSeek selected: yes
