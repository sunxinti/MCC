**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content:** The research question seeks to determine whether there is a correlation between androgen levels and sexual desire in women.
- **Key Information to Identify:** The presence and strength of correlations between various androgens (e.g., total testosterone, free testosterone, androstenedione, DHEAS) and measures of sexual desire. Additionally, whether androsterone glucuronide (ADT-G) is a better correlate than other androgens.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results:** The study found that in the total cohort of 560 healthy women, sexual desire correlated significantly with free testosterone (FT) and androstenedione. In specific subgroups:
  - Women aged 25-44 without systemic hormonal contraception showed correlations with total testosterone (TT), FT, androstenedione, and DHEAS.
  - Women aged 45-65 showed a correlation with androstenedione.
  - ADT-G did not show any correlation with sexual desire.
- **Strength and Reliability:** The study is cross-sectional with a substantial sample size (560 participants), and correlations were determined to be statistically significant at P<0.05. The use of mass spectrometry for androgen measurement adds reliability to the hormone level assessments.
- **Relevance:** The evidence directly addresses the question by examining various androgens and their correlation with sexual desire, making it highly relevant.

**3. Conclusion**
The study provides clear evidence of a correlation between certain androgens (specifically free testosterone and androstenedione) and sexual desire in women. While ADT-G was investigated, it did not show a correlation, reinforcing that other androgens are relevant factors. Therefore, based on the presented evidence, there is a correlation between androgens and sexual desire in women.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether there is a correlation between androgens and sexual desire in women. The key information to evaluate includes:  
- Whether the study found statistically significant correlations between specific androgens (e.g., TT, FT, androstenedione, DHEAS, ADT-G) and sexual desire.  
- The consistency of these correlations across different age groups and hormonal contraceptive use.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The study found:  
- **FT** and **androstenedione** were statistically significantly correlated with sexual desire in the **total cohort** of women.  
- In the **25–44-year-old subgroup** (without hormonal contraception), sexual desire correlated with **TT, FT, androstenedione, and DHEAS**.  
- In the **45–65-year-old group**, only **androstenedione** correlated with sexual desire.  
- **ADT-G** showed no correlation with sexual desire.  

The correlations were statistically significant (P<0.05), and the study used validated measures (e.g., Female Sexual Function Index, mass spectrometry). The results are relevant, as they directly address the relationship between androgens and sexual desire in a diverse cohort. However, the correlation varied by age and hormonal status, indicating it is not universal.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study demonstrates statistically significant correlations between certain androgens (e.g., FT, androstenedione) and sexual desire in women, particularly in younger and perimenopausal groups. While the correlation is not consistent across all age groups or androgen metrics (e.g., ADT-G), the presence of significant associations in key subgroups supports a **yes** answer. The question does not require a universal correlation, only whether such a relationship exists in some contexts, which the study confirms.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether there is a correlation between androgens and sexual desire in women. Key information to evaluate includes:  
- Study design (cross-sectional, 560 women, age subgroups).  
- Measured androgen levels (TT, FT, androstenedione, DHEAS, ADT-G) and their correlations with sexual desire (via FSFI scores).  
- Statistical significance (P<0.05) and subgroup analyses.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Total cohort**: FT and androstenedione showed statistically significant correlations with sexual desire.  
- **Subgroups**:  
  - Women aged 25–44 (no hormonal contraception): TT, FT, androstenedione, and DHEAS correlated with sexual desire.  
  - Women aged 45–65: Only androstenedione correlated.  
- **ADT-G**: No correlation with sexual desire.  
- The study confirms correlations in specific cohorts but highlights inconsistencies across age groups and androgen types.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence supports a **"yes"** answer: Androgens (FT, androstenedione, DHEAS, TT in subgroups) correlate with sexual desire in women, though the strength varies by age and androgen type. ADT-G lacks correlation, but the question broadly addresses androgens, not specific metabolites.
