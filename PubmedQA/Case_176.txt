**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content**: The research question seeks to determine whether fractional lasers can enhance the transdermal absorption of topical lidocaine in an in vivo animal model.
- **Key Information**:
  - Use of fractional lasers with varying ablative depths (500, 250, 50, and 25 µm).
  - Application of 4% topical lidocaine on treated versus untreated skin.
  - Measurement of serum lidocaine and MEGX levels post-application.
  - Comparison of absorption levels across different laser settings.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results and Data**:
  - **Untreated Skin**: Serum levels of lidocaine and MEGX were undetectable.
  - **Laser-Treated Skin**: Both lidocaine and MEGX were detectable in the blood.
  - **Peak Lidocaine Levels**: Significantly higher at 250 µm depth (0.62 mg/L) compared to other depths (500 µm: 0.45 mg/L; 50 µm: 0.48 mg/L; 25 µm: 0.3 mg/L) with P = 0.0002.
  - **Peak MEGX Levels**: Significantly higher at 250 µm depth (0.048 mg/L) compared to other depths (500 µm: 0.018 mg/L; 50 µm: 0.036 mg/L; 25 µm: 0.0144 mg/L) with P ≤ 0.0001.
- **Strength and Reliability**:
  - The study used an approved in vivo animal model with controlled conditions.
  - Statistical significance is strong (P-values far below 0.05), indicating robust results.
- **Relevance**:
  - Directly addresses the research question by measuring lidocaine absorption in an in vivo setting.
  - Demonstrates the effect of laser pretreatment on drug absorption, aligning with the study's aims.

**3. Conclusion**
The evidence strongly supports that fractional laser pretreatment significantly enhances the transdermal absorption of topical lidocaine in an in vivo animal model. The data shows detectable and significantly higher serum levels of lidocaine and its metabolite post-laser treatment, particularly at the 250 µm ablative depth.

**4. Final Answer:**
**My final choice is: "yes"**
GPT selected: yes

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether fractional lasers can enhance transdermal absorption of topical lidocaine in an in vivo animal model. Key information to assess includes:  
- Whether the study demonstrates increased lidocaine absorption after laser pretreatment compared to untreated skin.  
- Whether the results are statistically significant and relevant to the question.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Results**: In untreated skin, lidocaine and its metabolite (MEGX) were undetectable. After laser pretreatment, both were detectable in blood. The peak lidocaine levels were significantly higher at 250 µm (0.62 mg/L) compared to other settings (500, 50, 25 µm). MEGX also showed significantly higher peaks at 250 µm.  
- **Strength/Reliability**: The study used an in vivo animal model (pigs) with controlled laser settings and occluded lidocaine application. Statistical significance (P values ≤ 0.0001) supports the findings.  
- **Relevance**: The study directly addresses the question by comparing laser-treated vs. untreated skin and demonstrates measurable increases in absorption.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The study provides clear evidence that fractional laser pretreatment (Er:YAG) enhances transdermal lidocaine absorption in pigs, with detectable serum levels and statistically significant differences. The results directly answer the question affirmatively.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**
Qwen selected: yes

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether fractional lasers enhance transdermal absorption of topical lidocaine in an *in vivo* animal model. Key information to evaluate includes:  
- Whether laser pretreatment increased lidocaine absorption compared to untreated skin.  
- Whether varying laser settings (e.g., ablative depth) influenced absorption levels.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Results**:  
  - **Untreated skin**: Lidocaine and its metabolite (MEGX) were undetectable in serum.  
  - **Laser-treated skin**: Both lidocaine and MEGX became detectable, with peak levels varying significantly across laser depths.  
  - **Statistical significance**: Peak lidocaine levels were highest at 250 µm (0.62 mg/L, *P* = 0.0002 vs. other depths). MEGX levels also peaked at 250 µm (0.048 mg/L, *P* ≤ 0.0001).  
- **Strength and Relevance**:  
  - The study directly addresses *in vivo* absorption in an animal model (pigs) with controlled laser settings.  
  - Strong statistical significance supports the conclusion that laser settings modulate absorption.  
  - Limitations include a small sample size (4 pigs), but the repeated-measures design (comparing multiple depths) strengthens internal validity.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence confirms that fractional Er:YAG laser pretreatment significantly enhances transdermal lidocaine absorption in an *in vivo* animal model, with absorption levels dependent on laser settings. The results are statistically robust and directly answer the question.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**
