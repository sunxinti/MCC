**1. Question Analysis**

- **Core Question:** Does obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) affect aerobic fitness?
- **Key Information to Identify:** The relationship between OSA and measures of aerobic fitness (specifically VO2max) in patients, considering the severity of OSA.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**

- **Study Design:** Retrospective cohort analysis involving 247 patients with OSA compared to normative data from 1.4 million US Air Force cycle ergometry tests.
- **Findings:**
  - **Overall OSA Patients:** Showed an increased VO2max compared to the normative population (p<.001), suggesting no decrease in aerobic fitness.
  - **Severe OSA (AHI > 20):** Demonstrated a decreased VO2max compared to normalized values (p<.001), indicating reduced aerobic fitness in this subgroup.
  - **Post-Therapy:** No significant changes in VO2max were observed after medical or surgical treatment for OSA.
- **Strength and Reliability:** The study benefits from a large control group, enhancing the reliability of the comparative analysis. However, being retrospective, it may have inherent limitations such as selection bias.
- **Relevance:** Directly pertains to the impact of OSA on aerobic fitness, addressing both overall effects and severity-specific outcomes.

**3. Conclusion**

The evidence indicates that OSA does not universally decrease aerobic fitness; in fact, the general OSA population exhibited increased VO2max. However, in individuals with more severe OSA (AHI > 20), there is a significant decrease in aerobic fitness. Therefore, the effect of OSA on aerobic fitness is contingent upon the severity of the condition.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The core question is whether obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) affects aerobic fitness (measured by VO2max). Key information to identify includes:  
- Comparison of VO2max between OSA patients and a control group.  
- Effect of OSA severity (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] >20) on VO2max.  
- Impact of treatment on VO2max.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Overall Findings**: OSA patients had **higher** VO2max than the control group (p<0.001).  
- **Severe OSA (AHI >20)**: This subgroup had a **lower** VO2max compared to controls (p<0.001).  
- **Treatment Effect**: No improvement in VO2max after medical or surgical therapy.  
- **Study Design**: Retrospective analysis with a large control group (1.4 million), but potential confounders (e.g., selection bias in the Air Force population) may exist.  

The evidence shows that while OSA overall is not associated with reduced aerobic fitness, severe OSA (AHI >20) is linked to lower VO2max. The study’s conclusion emphasizes that OSA does not universally predict a decrease but highlights severity-dependent effects.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The answer depends on OSA severity. Since the question does not specify severity, the evidence suggests that OSA may or may not affect aerobic fitness, depending on disease severity. The study’s mixed results (overall increase in VO2max but decrease in severe cases) and the abstract’s acknowledgment of needing further correlation with severity support an uncertain ("maybe") answer.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) affects aerobic fitness, specifically measured by maximum oxygen consumption (VO₂max) during cycle ergometry. Key information to evaluate includes:  
- Comparison of VO₂max between OSA patients and controls.  
- Impact of OSA severity (e.g., apnea-hypopnea index, AHI >20).  
- Effects of treatment on aerobic fitness.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
- **Overall OSA vs. Controls**: The study found that OSA patients as a whole had **increased VO₂max** compared to normative data (p<.001), suggesting no negative impact on aerobic fitness.  
- **Severe OSA (AHI >20)**: Patients with AHI >20 showed **decreased VO₂max** (p<.001), indicating reduced aerobic fitness in severe cases.  
- **Treatment Effects**: No differences in VO₂max were observed post-treatment, implying treatment does not reverse fitness changes.  
- **Study Limitations**: Retrospective design and reliance on normative control data (not direct matched cohorts) may affect generalizability.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence shows OSA does not universally reduce aerobic fitness, but **severe OSA (AHI >20) significantly lowers VO₂max**. Since the question does not specify OSA severity, the answer depends on this critical nuance. For unstratified OSA, the overall finding is neutral or even increased fitness, but severe cases demonstrate impairment. Thus, the answer is **"maybe"**—OSA *can* affect aerobic fitness, but only in specific subgroups.
