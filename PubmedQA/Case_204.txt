Question: Do general practitioner hospitals reduce the utilisation of general hospital beds?

----- GPT's initial response -----
GPT is reasoning the answer...


**1. Question Analysis**
- **Core Content**: The research question seeks to determine whether the presence of general practitioner (GP) hospitals leads to a reduction in the utilization of general hospital beds.
- **Key Information to Look For**: Data comparing admission rates and occupied bed days between populations with access to GP hospitals versus those without. Specific reductions in utilization metrics and the conditions most affected by GP hospitals are also critical.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**
- **Research Results and Data**: The abstract presents clear evidence that populations with access to GP hospitals have lower rates of admissions and occupied bed days in general hospitals. Specifically, admissions were reduced by 26% for men and 28% for women, while occupied bed days decreased by 38% and 52%, respectively. The most significant reductions were observed for conditions commonly managed in GP hospitals.
- **Strength and Reliability**: The study is observational, utilizing five years of routine data from two general hospitals in Finnmark county, Norway, encompassing 35,435 admissions. The large sample size and extended period enhance the reliability of the findings.
- **Relevance to the Question**: The evidence directly addresses the research question by comparing populations with and without access to GP hospitals and demonstrating a measurable decrease in general hospital bed utilization.

**3. Conclusion**
Based on the provided abstract, there is strong scientific evidence supporting the conclusion that GP hospitals reduce the utilization of general hospital beds. The reductions in admissions and bed days are significant and consistent across different patient groups, indicating a reliable association.

**4. Final Answer**
**My final choice is: "yes"**
GPT selected: yes

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks whether general practitioner hospitals (GP hospitals) reduce the utilisation of general hospital beds. The key elements to evaluate are:  
- Comparison of admission rates and occupied bed days between populations with vs. without GP hospitals.  
- Evidence from the abstract regarding differences in these metrics, particularly for conditions commonly managed in GP hospitals.  

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The study found:  
- **26% lower admission rates for men and 28% lower for women** in areas with GP hospitals compared to those without.  
- **38% (men) to 52% (women) fewer occupied bed days** in areas with GP hospitals.  
- The largest differences were observed for conditions like respiratory diseases, cardiac failure, cancer, stroke, and fractures—conditions that GP hospitals either treat or manage long-term.  
- The study used routine data over five years from two hospitals, with a large sample size (35,435 admissions), enhancing reliability.  

The findings directly address the question and show a consistent, statistically significant reduction in general hospital utilisation. The observational design may have limitations (e.g., unmeasured confounders), but the abstract does not highlight such issues. The conclusion aligns with the data.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence strongly supports that GP hospitals reduce general hospital bed utilisation, as demonstrated by lower admission rates and occupied bed days in populations with access to these facilities. The specific conditions analyzed further strengthen the relevance of the findings to the question.  

**4. Final Answer:**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**
Qwen selected: yes

**1. Question Analysis**  
The core question is whether access to GP hospitals reduces general hospital bed utilization (admissions and occupied bed days). Key information needed includes comparative data on admissions and bed days between populations with and without GP hospitals, particularly for diagnoses commonly managed in GP hospitals.

**2. Evidence Evaluation**  
The study compared populations with and without GP hospitals in Norway:  
- **Admission rates** were 26% (men) and 28% (women) lower in areas with GP hospitals.  
- **Occupied bed days** were 38% (men) and 52% (women) lower in these areas.  
- Largest reductions occurred for conditions like respiratory diseases, cardiac failure, cancer, stroke, and fractures—commonly treated or followed up in GP hospitals.  
The observational design introduces potential confounding, but the magnitude and consistency of the reductions across metrics and diagnoses strengthen the findings. The abstract explicitly concludes GP hospitals reduce general hospital utilization.  

**3. Conclusion**  
The evidence strongly supports that GP hospitals reduce general hospital bed utilization, as admissions and bed days were significantly lower in populations with GP hospitals. While observational studies have limitations, the data aligns with the authors' conclusion.  

**4. Final Answer**  
**My final choice is: "yes"**
DeepSeek selected: yes

Initial consensus: All models selected yes
