Case_description: 
A 75-year-old with hypertension and atrial fibrillation comes to the emergency department because of a 2-hour history of severe abdominal pain and nausea. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the past 45 years.

The most likely cause of his condition is occlusion of a branch of which of the following arteries?
Options: 
1. Median sacral artery

GPT's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** A 75-year-old male with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation (AFib).  
- **Chief Complaint:** Severe abdominal pain and nausea lasting for 2 hours.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - Acute onset of severe abdominal pain  
  - Nausea  
  - Smoking history (1 pack/day for 45 years)  
  - Intraoperative findings of dusky discoloration of the hepatic colonic flexure and adjacent transverse colon  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline:** The rapid onset of severe abdominal pain over 2 hours suggests an acute abdominal event, such as mesenteric ischemia or bowel infarction.  
- **Patient History:** AFib is a significant risk factor for arterial embolism, which can lead to acute mesenteric ischemia.  
- **Smoking History:** Increases the risk of atherosclerosis, though acute embolic events are more directly related to AFib.  
- **Intraoperative Findings:** Dusky discoloration indicates compromised blood flow to the affected colon segments, suggesting ischemia or infarction. The hepatic flexure is a watershed area between the distributions of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA), making it susceptible to ischemia.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Median sacral artery**  
  - *Relevance:* Supplies the sacrum and coccygeum; not involved in colonic blood supply.  
  - *Conclusion:* Unlikely to be related to colonic ischemia.

- **Option 2: Inferior mesenteric artery (IMA)**  
  - *Relevance:* Supplies the distal colon, including the left colic, sigmoid, and superior rectal arteries.  
  - *Conclusion:* While the hepatic flexure is near the area supplied by the IMA, embolic events more commonly affect the SMA. Partial occlusion of the IMA typically affects more distal colon regions.

- **Option 3: Celiac artery**  
  - *Relevance:* Supplies the foregut (e.g., stomach, liver, spleen); not directly involved in colon blood supply.  
  - *Conclusion:* Unrelated to the ischemia of the hepatic flexure and transverse colon.

- **Option 4: Internal iliac artery**  
  - *Relevance:* Supplies the pelvic organs and lower limbs; not involved in colonic circulation.  
  - *Conclusion:* Not related to colonic ischemia.

- **Option 5: Superior mesenteric artery (SMA)**  
  - *Relevance:* Supplies the majority of the intestine, including the transverse colon via the middle colic artery and the hepatic flexure via the marginal artery.  
  - *Clinical Correlation:* AFib increases the risk of SMA embolism, leading to acute mesenteric ischemia affecting the hepatic flexure and transverse colon.  
  - *Conclusion:* Most consistent with the clinical presentation and intraoperative findings.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 5 (Superior mesenteric artery)(上肠动脉)**

Qwen is reasoning the answer...

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 5 (Superior mesenteric artery)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Basic Information**: 75-year-old male with hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and a 45-pack-year smoking history.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Severe abdominal pain and nausea for 2 hours.  
- **Key Findings**: Emergency laparotomy revealed dusky discoloration of the **hepatic colonic flexure** (right colic flexure) and adjacent transverse colon.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Symptoms**: Sudden onset of severe abdominal pain and nausea suggest acute mesenteric ischemia.  
- **Anatomic Focus**: The hepatic flexure and adjacent transverse colon are supplied by the **middle colic artery**, a major branch of the **superior mesenteric artery (SMA)**.  
- **Atrial Fibrillation Risk**: Embolic events from atrial fibrillation are a common cause of SMA occlusion, leading to transverse colon ischemia.  
- **Smoking History**: Increases the risk of atherosclerosis, contributing to mesenteric artery occlusion.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1. Median sacral artery**: Supplies the rectum and sacral region. Unlikely as the hepatic flexure is far from this territory.  
- **Option 2. Inferior mesenteric artery (IMA)**: Supplies the left colon (descending, sigmoid, rectum). The hepatic flexure is not in its territory.  
- **Option 3. Celiac artery**: Supplies the foregut (stomach, liver, spleen). Does not directly supply the transverse colon.  
- **Option 4. Internal iliac artery**: Supplies pelvic structures and the rectum. Not relevant to the hepatic flexure.  
- **Option 5. Superior mesenteric artery (SMA)**: Supplies the transverse colon via the **middle colic artery**. Occlusion here would cause ischemia in the hepatic flexure and adjacent transverse colon, matching the surgical findings.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 5 (Superior mesenteric artery)(肠系膜上动脉)**  

**Key Evidence Supporting This Choice**:  
- The hepatic colonic flexure and transverse colon are within the **SMA territory** (supplied by the middle colic artery).  
- Acute ischemia in this region is most commonly due to embolism (e.g., from atrial fibrillation) or atherosclerosis (smoking history), both of which can occlude the SMA.  
- The inferior mesenteric artery and other options do not anatomically align with the described location of injury.

Choice: Option 5 (Superior mesenteric artery)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Profile**: 75-year-old male with hypertension, atrial fibrillation (AF), and a 45-pack-year smoking history.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Acute onset of severe abdominal pain and nausea lasting 2 hours.  
- **Key Findings**: Dusky discoloration of the hepatic colonic flexure and adjacent transverse colon during laparotomy.  
- **Decisive Features**: Acute mesenteric ischemia localized to the proximal transverse colon and hepatic flexure, coupled with AF (a major thromboembolic risk factor).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline and Symptoms**: Sudden severe abdominal pain and nausea suggest acute vascular compromise. AF increases the likelihood of thromboembolism.  
- **Anatomical Localization**: The hepatic flexure and proximal transverse colon are part of the midgut, supplied by the **superior mesenteric artery (SMA)**. Dusky discoloration indicates ischemic colitis secondary to arterial occlusion.  
- **Supporting Evidence**:  
  - AF predisposes to emboli lodging in SMA branches (e.g., middle colic artery).  
  - Smoking and hypertension are risk factors for atherosclerosis, but acute ischemia in this distribution favors embolism over thrombosis.  
- **Contradictory Evidence**:  
  - Inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) occlusion would affect the distal transverse/descending colon, inconsistent with the findings.  
  - Celiac artery involvement would cause foregut ischemia (e.g., stomach, liver), not isolated colonic changes.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Median sacral artery**: Supplies sacral/pelvic structures; irrelevant to colonic ischemia. **Eliminated**.  
2. **Inferior mesenteric artery (IMA)**: Supplies distal transverse colon to rectum. Affected area is outside IMA territory. **Eliminated**.  
3. **Celiac artery**: Supplies foregut (stomach, liver, pancreas). No upper abdominal symptoms or foregut ischemia. **Eliminated**.  
4. **Internal iliac artery**: Supplies pelvic organs (e.g., rectum, bladder). No pelvic involvement. **Eliminated**.  
5. **Superior mesenteric artery (SMA)**: Supplies midgut, including the hepatic flexure and proximal transverse colon via the middle colic artery. Occlusion of a branch (e.g., middle colic artery) aligns perfectly with the ischemic findings. **Strongly Supported**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 5 (Superior mesenteric artery)(肠系膜上动脉)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Anatomical match: The hepatic flexure and proximal transverse colon are SMA-dependent territories.  
  - AF-associated embolism is the most likely mechanism.  
  - Acute presentation and operative findings exclude chronic or non-vascular causes.
