Case_description: 
A 65-year-old male presents to his primary care physician for stiffness in his arm. He states that he has been having trouble combing his hair and reaching objects that are high on the shelf. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes mellitus type II, obesity, and hypertension. His current medications include metformin, insulin, lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide. The patient admits to leading a sedentary life in which he tends to stay home and watch television. He does not engage in any physical or strenuous activity. On physical exam the patient has decreased passive and active range of motion of his shoulder. Strength of the patient's upper extremity is 4/5. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options: 
1. Rotator cuff impingement
2. Adhesive capsulitis
3. Biceps tendinopathy
4. Glenohumeral osteoarthritis
5. Subacromial bursitis

GPT's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** 65-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, obesity, and hypertension.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Stiffness in his arm, difficulty combing hair, and reaching high shelves.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - Decreased passive and active range of motion (ROM) in the shoulder.  
  - Upper extremity strength reduced to 4/5.  
  - Sedentary lifestyle with minimal physical activity.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Age and Comorbidities:** The patient’s age and history of diabetes mellitus are significant, as adhesive capsulitis is more common in diabetic individuals.  
- **Symptom Onset and Progression:** The gradual onset of shoulder stiffness and ROM limitation suggests a condition involving joint capsule or soft tissue fibrosis.  
- **Range of Motion:** Both passive and active ROM are decreased, which is characteristic of adhesive capsulitis, where the joint capsule becomes inflamed and fibrotic, restricting movement regardless of muscle strength.  
- **Muscle Strength:** Slight weakness (4/5) can be present in adhesive capsulitis due to disuse, but it is not as prominent in conditions like rotator cuff impingement where pain is the primary feature.  
- **Lifestyle Factors:** A sedentary lifestyle may contribute to joint stiffness and reduced mobility, further supporting adhesive capsulitis.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Rotator Cuff Impingement:** Typically presents with pain during specific movements, especially abduction and external rotation. Passive ROM is usually preserved. The significant ROM restriction seen in this patient is less consistent with this diagnosis.  
2. **Adhesive Capsulitis:** Characterized by significant restriction in both active and passive ROM, particularly in external rotation and abduction. Common in patients with diabetes and those leading sedentary lifestyles. The clinical presentation aligns well with this condition.  
3. **Biceps Tendinopathy:** Often presents with anterior shoulder pain and may involve weakness in supination or flexion, but does not typically cause widespread ROM restriction.  
4. **Glenohumeral Osteoarthritis:** May present with pain and gradual ROM limitation; however, the patient’s presentation with equal passive and active ROM restriction leans more towards adhesive capsulitis. Osteoarthritis also typically involves joint crepitus and more localized pain.  
5. **Subacromial Bursitis:** Usually presents with pain and tenderness over the subacromial area, especially with overhead activities. ROM is generally preserved unless there is concurrent rotator cuff pathology.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Adhesive capsulitis)(粘连性关节囊炎)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 2 (Adhesive capsulitis)

Qwen's full response:

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 65-year-old male with type II diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and a sedentary lifestyle presents with shoulder stiffness impairing activities like combing hair and reaching high shelves.  
- Key clinical findings: **decreased active and passive range of motion (ROM) in the shoulder**, mild upper extremity weakness (4/5), and functional limitations consistent with shoulder stiffness.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Symptoms**: The progressive stiffness and functional impairment suggest a chronic, restrictive process rather than acute trauma or inflammation. The sedentary lifestyle may contribute to joint stiffness due to disuse.  
- **Physical Exam**: Decreased **both active and passive ROM** is critical. While passive ROM limitation is a hallmark of adhesive capsulitis ("frozen shoulder"), rotator cuff pathology typically spares passive ROM. Mild weakness (4/5) likely reflects disuse atrophy secondary to limited mobility rather than primary muscle or nerve injury.  
- **Risk Factors**: Diabetes mellitus is a well-documented risk factor for adhesive capsulitis, increasing its likelihood.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **1. Rotator Cuff Impingement**: Pain is typically worse with overhead movements (e.g., reaching), and weakness in external rotation or abduction. Passive ROM is usually preserved. The patient’s decreased passive ROM and diabetes make this less likely.  
- **2. Adhesive Capsulitis**: Strongly supported by the chronic stiffness, symmetric active and passive ROM loss, and diabetes. The sedentary lifestyle exacerbates joint stiffness. Pain often precedes stiffness in early stages but may resolve as the condition progresses.  
- **3. Biceps Tendinopathy**: Anterior shoulder pain and weakness with resisted supination or flexion are typical. Passive ROM is usually intact. No mention of anterior pain or specific weakness patterns here.  
- **4. Glenohumeral Osteoarthritis**: Less common but possible in obese patients. Would present with pain, crepitus, and stiffness, but the absence of joint enlargement or systemic symptoms (e.g., inflammatory markers) makes this less likely.  
- **5. Subacromial Bursitis**: Pain and tenderness over the bursa, exacerbated by movement. Passive ROM is typically preserved, unlike in adhesive capsulitis.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Adhesive capsulitis) (粘连性囊炎)**  

**Key Supporting Evidence**:  
- **Diabetes mellitus**: A major risk factor for adhesive capsulitis.  
- **Decreased active and passive ROM**: A hallmark of frozen shoulder, distinguishing it from rotator cuff issues (preserved passive ROM).  
- **Sedentary lifestyle**: Prolonged immobility exacerbates capsular contractures.  
- **Mild weakness (4/5)**: Reflects disuse atrophy rather than primary muscle or tendon injury.

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 2 (Adhesive capsulitis)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Profile**: 65-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type II, obesity, hypertension, sedentary lifestyle.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Shoulder stiffness, difficulty combing hair and reaching high objects.  
- **Key Findings**:  
  - **Decreased active and passive range of motion (ROM)** of the shoulder.  
  - **4/5 upper extremity strength** (mild weakness).  
  - No explicit mention of pain, swelling, or trauma.  
- **Risk Factors**: Diabetes, sedentary behavior, age.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Stiffness and ROM Limitation**: Global restriction of both active and passive shoulder motion (especially abduction and external rotation) is a hallmark of **adhesive capsulitis**. This distinguishes it from conditions like rotator cuff pathology, where passive ROM is typically preserved.  
- **Diabetes Association**: Diabetes mellitus is a well-established risk factor for adhesive capsulitis (prevalence ~20-30% in diabetics).  
- **Absence of Pain Dominance**: Conditions like rotator cuff impingement, biceps tendinopathy, or bursitis typically present with significant pain during movement, which is not emphasized here.  
- **4/5 Strength**: Mild weakness may reflect disuse atrophy due to chronic immobility rather than a primary neuromuscular injury.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Rotator Cuff Impingement**:  
   - Expected **pain with overhead activities**, preserved passive ROM, and positive impingement signs (Neer/Hawkins tests).  
   - **Does not explain global stiffness** or passive ROM loss. **Less likely**.  
2. **Adhesive Capsulitis**:  
   - Classic triad: **pain (early stage) → stiffness (later stage) → gradual resolution**.  
   - **Diabetes strongly correlates** with idiopathic adhesive capsulitis.  
   - **Global ROM loss (active and passive)** aligns perfectly with this case. **Most likely**.  
3. **Biceps Tendinopathy**:  
   - Anterior shoulder pain localized to the bicipital groove, aggravated by flexion/supination.  
   - Stiffness is not a primary feature. **Unlikely**.  
4. **Glenohumeral Osteoarthritis**:  
   - Pain worsens with activity, crepitus, and radiographic joint space narrowing.  
   - Stiffness is secondary to structural degeneration, but passive ROM is often preserved early. **Less likely without imaging**.  
5. **Subacromial Bursitis**:  
   - Painful arc (60–120° abduction), focal tenderness over the subacromial space.  
   - Stiffness is not a dominant feature. **Unlikely**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Adhesive capsulitis)(粘连性关节囊炎)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  1. **Global loss of active and passive shoulder ROM**, a defining feature of adhesive capsulitis.  
  2. **Diabetes mellitus**, a major risk factor for this condition.  
  3. Absence of dominant pain or focal tenderness, consistent with the "stiffness-predominant" phase of adhesive capsulitis.  
  4. Exclusion of other diagnoses due to lack of pain-dominant features or structural signs (e.g., crepitus, impingement).
