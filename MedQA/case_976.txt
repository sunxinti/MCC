Case_description: 
A 25-year-old, G2P2L2 woman presents with a complaint of missed menstrual cycle for 4 weeks. Her previous menstrual cycles were regular, occurring every 28–35 days consistently. The patient does not have any other complaints currently. Her past medical history reveals two uncomplicated and normal vaginal deliveries at term. She has a 2-year-old boy and a 6-month-old girl. The patient and her partner use the withdrawal method for contraception. The urine pregnancy test result is positive. The patient returns to the clinic after 1 week expressing her desire to discontinue with the pregnancy and inquires about the possibility of an elective abortion. Which of the following procedures is the most appropriate for elective termination of pregnancy in this patient?
Options: 
1. Dilatation and evacuation (D&E)
2. Oxytocin-induced labor
3. Manual uterine aspiration
4. Dilatation and curettage (D & C) after vacuum evacuation
5. Oral mifepristone + misoprostol
Correct Answer: Oral mifepristone + misoprostol

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** A 25-year-old female, gravida 2 para 2 living children (G2P2L2), with two uncomplicated vaginal deliveries at term.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Missed menstrual cycle for 4 weeks.  
- **Clinical Manifestations:** Previously regular menstrual cycles (28–35 days). Currently asymptomatic except for a positive urine pregnancy test.  
- **Additional Information:** Uses the withdrawal method of contraception. Desires elective termination of pregnancy.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
The patient presents with a missed menstrual period of 4 weeks, which, given her regular cycle length, suggests early pregnancy. A positive urine pregnancy test confirms this. She is in the early first trimester of pregnancy, approximately 5 weeks gestational age. There are no complications or contraindications reported that would impact the choice of abortion method. Her desire for elective termination and the current gestational age are critical in determining the most appropriate procedure.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
Considering the gestational age (approximately 5 weeks), the most appropriate methods for elective abortion are:

1. **Dilatation and evacuation (D&E):** Typically recommended for second-trimester abortions (after 12 weeks). Not suitable for first-trimester termination.
2. **Oxytocin-induced labor:** Used for inducing labor in later stages of pregnancy, not appropriate for early termination.
3. **Manual uterine aspiration:** Suitable for first-trimester abortions and is a safe, effective surgical method.
4. **Dilatation and curettage (D & C) after vacuum evacuation:** Generally used in the second trimester or for specific indications beyond early pregnancy.
5. **Oral mifepristone + misoprostol:** A medical abortion method recommended for early first-trimester termination (up to 10 weeks).

Options 3 and 5 are aligned with the patient's gestational age and desire for elective termination. However, current clinical guidelines often prefer medical abortion (Option 5) due to its non-invasive nature, high efficacy, and patient preference for avoiding surgical procedures when appropriate.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 5. Oral mifepristone + misoprostol (口服米非司酮加米索前列醇)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 5 (Oral mifepristone + misoprostol)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 25-year-old gravida 2, para 2 woman presents with a 4-week missed menstrual cycle and a positive urine pregnancy test.  
- She has no other complaints and a history of two uncomplicated vaginal deliveries.  
- The patient requests elective termination of pregnancy and uses withdrawal as contraception.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Gestational Age**: The patient is 4 weeks pregnant (within the first trimester), which is well within the timeframe for medical abortion (up to 10 weeks) or early surgical procedures.  
- **Prior Delivery History**: Her two prior vaginal deliveries may facilitate cervical dilatability, but this is not critical at such an early gestational age.  
- **Contraceptive Method**: Withdrawal is an unreliable method, explaining the unintended pregnancy.  
- **Symptoms**: No complications are reported, supporting an elective procedure.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (D&E)**: Typically used beyond 13 weeks for second-trimester abortions. At 4 weeks, this is unnecessary and overly invasive.  
- **Option 2 (Oxytocin-induced labor)**: Reserved for later gestational ages (e.g., second trimester) to induce labor. Ineffective and unsafe at 4 weeks.  
- **Option 3 (Manual uterine aspiration)**: Suitable for early pregnancy (up to 6–12 weeks), but medical abortion is preferred as first-line due to non-invasiveness and lower complication risks.  
- **Option 4 (D&C after vacuum evacuation)**: D&C is outdated and associated with higher risks (e.g., uterine perforation) compared to vacuum aspiration alone. Unnecessary at this stage.  
- **Option 5 (Mifepristone + misoprostol)**: Medical abortion is the gold standard for pregnancies ≤10 weeks. It is safe, effective (≥95% efficacy at 4 weeks), and avoids surgical risks.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 5 (Oral mifepristone + misoprostol) (口服米非司酮+米索前列醇)**  

Key evidence supporting this choice:  
- The patient’s gestational age (4 weeks) falls within the recommended timeframe for medical abortion.  
- Medical abortion is preferred as first-line due to high efficacy, non-invasiveness, and fewer complications compared to surgical procedures.  
- Clinical guidelines (e.g., WHO and ACOG) endorse mifepristone combined with misoprostol for early pregnancy termination.

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 5 (Oral mifepristone + misoprostol)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 25-year-old G2P2L2 woman with regular menstrual cycles (28–35 days) presents with a 4-week missed period.  
- Urine pregnancy test is positive. She desires elective termination of pregnancy.  
- Key clinical features: Gestational age ~8–9 weeks (based on 4-week missed cycle + 1-week follow-up delay), uncomplicated obstetric history, and no contraindications to abortion.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- Gestational age calculation: A 4-week missed period (assuming 28-day cycle) corresponds to ~8 weeks gestation. Returning after 1 week places her at ~9 weeks.  
- Medical abortion (mifepristone + misoprostol) is effective up to 10 weeks (70 days) per FDA/WHO guidelines. Manual uterine aspiration (MVA) is effective up to 12–14 weeks.  
- Surgical methods (e.g., D&E, oxytocin-induced labor) are reserved for later gestations (>12–14 weeks). D&C after vacuum evacuation is outdated compared to vacuum aspiration alone.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **D&E**: Used for second-trimester abortions (>12–14 weeks). Not applicable here.  
2. **Oxytocin-induced labor**: For mid-to-late second trimester. Irrelevant at 9 weeks.  
3. **Manual uterine aspiration (MVA)**: Appropriate for first trimester (up to 12–14 weeks). Viable option.  
4. **D&C after vacuum evacuation**: Redundant and less preferred compared to MVA.  
5. **Oral mifepristone + misoprostol**: First-line for pregnancies ≤10 weeks. High efficacy (~95–98%) at 9 weeks.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 5 (Oral mifepristone + misoprostol)(口服米非司酮+米索前列醇)**  
- Key evidence: The patient’s gestational age (~9 weeks) falls within the FDA/WHO-approved window for medical abortion (≤10 weeks). This method is non-invasive, safe, and effective, aligning with standard guidelines for elective termination in early pregnancy. Surgical options (e.g., MVA) are also appropriate but not superior in this scenario unless patient preference or contraindications exist, which are not stated here.
