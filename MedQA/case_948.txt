**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**
- **Patient Information:** A 67-year-old man with a history of hypertension and peripheral vascular disease.
- **Chief Complaint:** Follow-up after hospital discharge for a managed ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**
  - **Vital Signs:** Elevated blood pressure (167/118 mmHg), jugular venous distention (JVD), bilateral lower extremity pitting edema.
  - **Echocardiography:** Normal ejection fraction (55%).
  - **Behavioral Factors:** Non-compliance with prescribed medications and missed follow-up appointment.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**
- **Hypertension:** Persistently elevated blood pressure despite recent STEMI indicates inadequate blood pressure control, increasing the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events.
- **Jugular Venous Distention and Lower Extremity Edema:** Suggest volume overload, which may indicate heart failure or other cardiac complications despite a preserved ejection fraction.
- **Ejection Fraction:** An EF of 55% is within the normal range, making systolic heart failure less likely. However, diastolic dysfunction or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) remains a consideration.
- **Non-Compliance:** Failure to fill prescriptions and attend follow-ups exacerbates the risk of adverse outcomes post-MI, emphasizing the need for effective and well-tolerated medications.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**
- **Option 1: Atenolol**
  - **Class:** Beta-blocker.
  - **Benefits:** Reduces mortality post-MI by decreasing myocardial oxygen demand.
  - **Considerations:** Less selective than Metoprolol succinate; may be less preferred in certain guidelines.

- **Option 2: Hydrochlorothiazide**
  - **Class:** Thiazide diuretic.
  - **Benefits:** Effective for hypertension management.
  - **Limitations:** Does not have a direct mortality benefit post-MI compared to beta-blockers or ACE inhibitors.

- **Option 3: Lisinopril**
  - **Class:** ACE inhibitor.
  - **Benefits:** Reduces mortality post-MI, particularly beneficial in patients with heart failure or reduced EF.
  - **Considerations:** While beneficial, the patient's EF is normal, potentially making beta-blockers a more impactful choice.

- **Option 4: Metoprolol succinate**
  - **Class:** Beta-1 selective beta-blocker.
  - **Benefits:** Proven mortality benefit post-MI, effective in reducing the risk of recurrent myocardial infarction and managing hypertension.
  - **Advantages:** Extended-release formulation improves compliance; superior evidence for mortality reduction in post-MI patients irrespective of EF.

- **Option 5: Propranolol**
  - **Class:** Non-selective beta-blocker.
  - **Benefits:** Useful for certain indications like arrhythmias.
  - **Limitations:** Less selective, increasing the risk of side effects; not the first-line choice for post-MI mortality reduction.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Metoprolol succinate)(美托洛尔琥珀酸盐)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 4 (Metoprolol succinate)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 67-year-old man with a recent STEMI (1 week prior) did not adhere to post-discharge care (unfilled prescriptions, missed follow-up).  
- Key symptoms/signs:  
  - Hypertension (BP 167/118 mmHg).  
  - Jugular venous distension and bilateral lower extremity pitting edema (suggesting fluid retention or volume overload).  
  - Preserved ejection fraction (EF 55%) on echocardiography.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline and Presentation**: Post-STEMI patient with poor adherence to post-MI care, now presenting with uncontrolled hypertension and signs of fluid retention.  
- **Key Clinical Features**:  
  - **Hypertension**: Critical as uncontrolled BP exacerbates myocardial oxygen demand and increases cardiovascular risk.  
  - **Fluid Retention (JVD, edema)**: Could indicate volume overload secondary to poor BP control or early heart failure, despite preserved EF.  
  - **Preserved EF**: Suggests no systolic dysfunction at this time, but post-MI management remains critical for long-term outcomes.  
- **Absent Findings**: No mention of dyspnea, rales, or elevated natriuretic peptides, reducing likelihood of overt heart failure.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Atenolol**  
  - A selective beta-1 blocker.  
  - **Pros**: Reduces mortality in post-MI patients.  
  - **Cons**: Short-acting (twice daily), may not provide steady protection; vasodilatory effects might limit BP control in severe hypertension.  
  - **Alignment**: Suitable but less optimal than long-acting agents.  

- **Option 2: Hydrochlorothiazide**  
  - Diuretic for volume overload and BP control.  
  - **Pros**: Addresses edema and hypertension.  
  - **Cons**: No mortality benefit in post-MI patients without heart failure; may exacerbate hypovolemia if overused.  
  - **Alignment**: Secondary to beta-blockers for mortality reduction.  

- **Option 3: Lisinopril**  
  - ACE inhibitor for BP control and heart failure.  
  - **Pros**: Reduces mortality in post-MI patients with reduced EF or heart failure.  
  - **Cons**: EF is preserved; no clear evidence of heart failure (normal EF, no dyspnea).  
  - **Alignment**: Less urgent than beta-blockers in this scenario.  

- **Option 4: Metoprolol Succinate**  
  - Long-acting beta-1 blocker.  
  - **Pros**: Gold standard for post-MI mortality reduction, especially in STEMI; steady-state dosing improves adherence.  
  - **Cons**: Requires monitoring in systolic dysfunction, but EF is preserved here.  
  - **Alignment**: Best fits the patient’s need for long-term BP control and mortality reduction.  

- **Option 5: Propranolol**  
  - Non-selective beta-blocker with alpha-blocking properties.  
  - **Pros**: BP-lowering effect.  
  - **Cons**: Increased risk of bronchoconstriction and hypotension; not preferred in cardiac patients.  
  - **Alignment**: Poor due to side effect profile and lack of guideline support.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Metoprolol succinate) (美托洛尔缓释片)**  

**Key Evidence**:  
- Post-STEMI patients benefit most from beta-blockers to reduce mortality, arrhythmias, and ischemia, regardless of EF.  
- Metoprolol succinate is a long-acting beta-1 blocker, preferred over short-acting agents (e.g., atenolol) for sustained efficacy and adherence.  
- While lisinopril may address hypertension and fluid retention, its mortality benefit is secondary to beta-blockers in this context.  
- The patient’s preserved EF and lack of overt heart failure make beta-blockers the priority for mortality reduction.

Choice: Option 4 (Metoprolol succinate)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 67-year-old man post-STEMI, non-adherent to medications/follow-up.  
- **History**: Hypertension, peripheral vascular disease.  
- **Vitals**: Elevated BP (167/118 mmHg), pulse 90/min.  
- **Exam**: Jugular venous distention (JVD), bilateral lower extremity pitting edema.  
- **Echo**: Preserved ejection fraction (EF 55%).  
- **Key Findings**: Post-STEMI status, uncontrolled hypertension, fluid overload signs (JVD/edema), preserved EF.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Post-STEMI Management**: Requires mortality-reducing medications (beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors).  
- **Hypertension**: Severe elevation (167/118 mmHg) necessitates aggressive control to prevent complications.  
- **Fluid Overload**: JVD and edema suggest volume retention, possibly due to diastolic dysfunction (HFpEF) or hypertension.  
- **Preserved EF (55%)**: Indicates intact systolic function; HFpEF is likely, where mortality benefits of therapies are less clear.  
- **Absent Findings**: No signs of acute decompensation (e.g., hypoxia, hypotension) or reduced EF (<40%).  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Atenolol**: Beta-1 selective, but lacks robust evidence for mortality reduction post-MI compared to newer beta-blockers.  
2. **Hydrochlorothiazide**: Reduces fluid overload/BP but lacks mortality benefit post-MI.  
3. **Lisinopril**: ACE inhibitor reduces mortality post-MI, especially with hypertension. However, benefit in preserved EF is less pronounced.  
4. **Metoprolol succinate**: Cardioselective beta-blocker with proven mortality benefit in post-MI and HF (even with preserved EF in some trials). Preferred over atenolol/propranolol.  
5. **Propranolol**: Non-selective beta-blocker; contraindicated in peripheral vascular disease (risk of vasoconstriction).  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Metoprolol succinate)(琥珀酸美托洛尔)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Metoprolol succinate is a guideline-recommended beta-blocker for post-MI mortality reduction (Class I ACC/AHA).  
  - Superior to atenolol/propranolol in reducing mortality and ventricular arrhythmias.  
  - Addresses tachycardia (pulse 90/min) and hypertension, critical in post-STEMI care.  
  - Proven benefit even in preserved EF, while ACE inhibitors (lisinopril) have weaker mortality data in this subgroup.  
  - Avoids risks of non-selective beta-blockers (propranolol) and inferiority of thiazides/older beta-blockers.
