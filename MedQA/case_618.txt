**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**
- **Patient Information:** A 48-year-old male with a history of prolonged alcohol use, who abruptly ceased alcohol consumption 5 days ago.
- **Chief Complaint:** Presented to the emergency department with a high fever (40.0°C or 104.0°F) persisting for the past day.
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**
  - **Autonomic Instability:** Elevated pulse (130/min), increased blood pressure (146/88 mm Hg), and heightened respiratory rate (24/min).
  - **Neurological Symptoms:** Confusion, restlessness, agitation, and lack of orientation to time, place, or person.
  - **Psychiatric Symptoms:** Complaints of tactile hallucinations (sensation of bugs crawling over his skin) without any external stimuli.
- **Relevant History:** Abrupt cessation of alcohol intake 5 days prior, with no significant medical history or current medications.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**
- **Timeline:** The patient ceased alcohol consumption 5 days ago, and within the past day, he developed acute onset fever and neuropsychiatric symptoms.
- **Alcohol Withdrawal Spectrum:** Alcohol withdrawal can present with a range of symptoms from mild tremors and anxiety to severe manifestations like seizures and delirium tremens (DTs). DTs typically occur between 48 to 72 hours after the last drink but can present up to a week later.
- **Symptomatology Consistent with DTs:**
  - **Autonomic Hyperactivity:** Elevated heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate.
  - **Neuropsychiatric Disturbances:** Severe confusion, agitation, hallucinations (particularly tactile), and disorientation.
  - **Fever:** Hyperthermia is often seen in DTs due to increased metabolic activity and hyperadrenergic state.
- **Differential Considerations:**
  - **Septicemia:** Can present with fever and altered mental status, but the history of recent alcohol cessation and absence of other infectious signs make it less likely.
  - **Seizure Disorders:** Postictal states can cause confusion but are usually associated with a history of seizures, which is absent here.
  - **Other Withdrawal Syndromes:** Such as benzodiazepine or opioid withdrawal, but the history points specifically to alcohol withdrawal.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**
- **Option 1: Chlorpromazine**
  - **Use:** Antipsychotic used for psychosis and agitation.
  - **Suitability:** Not first-line for DTs; may not adequately manage autonomic instability and carries a risk of lowering the seizure threshold.
- **Option 2: Clonidine**
  - **Use:** Alpha-2 adrenergic agonist used for hypertension and some withdrawal symptoms.
  - **Suitability:** Can address autonomic symptoms but does not address the underlying GABAergic deficiency in alcohol withdrawal; not first-line for DTs.
- **Option 3: Diazepam**
  - **Use:** Benzodiazepine used for anxiety, seizures, and alcohol withdrawal.
  - **Suitability:** First-line treatment for DTs due to its efficacy in reducing autonomic hyperactivity, preventing seizures, and alleviating agitation and confusion by enhancing GABAergic transmission.
- **Option 4: Haloperidol**
  - **Use:** Antipsychotic used for schizophrenia and acute psychosis.
  - **Suitability:** May help with agitation but does not prevent seizures and can exacerbate autonomic instability; not first-line for DTs.
- **Option 5: Phenytoin**
  - **Use:** Anticonvulsant used for seizure prevention and epilepsy.
  - **Suitability:** Not effective in preventing seizures in alcohol withdrawal; benzodiazepines are preferred.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Diazepam)(地西泮)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 3 (Diazepam)

Qwen's full response:

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 48-year-old male presents with a sudden onset of fever (40.0°C), tachycardia (130/min), hypertension (146/88 mmHg), tachypnea (24/min), confusion, agitation, and tactile hallucinations (feeling bugs crawling on skin).  
- Key symptoms include autonomic hyperactivity (fever, tachycardia, hypertension), severe confusion, and hallucinations. The abrupt cessation of alcohol 5 days prior is critical.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline**: Symptoms developed 5 days after alcohol withdrawal, aligning with the typical 48–72-hour window for delirium tremens (DTs).  
- **Hallucinations**: Tactile hallucinations ("formication") are classic in alcohol withdrawal delirium.  
- **Autonomic Hyperactivity**: Fever, tachycardia, hypertension, and tachypnea reflect sympathetic overactivity, a hallmark of DTs.  
- **Mental Status**: Confusion, disorientation, and agitation are consistent with delirium.  
- **Exclusion of Other Causes**: No medications, unremarkable past medical history, and absence of infections (e.g., meningitis) as primary causes.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (Chlorpromazine)**: An antipsychotic with anticholinergic and α1-blocking effects. While used historically for DTs, it is less preferred due to risks of hypotension and extrapyramidal side effects. Not first-line.  
- **Option 2 (Clonidine)**: An α2-agonist that reduces autonomic hyperactivity but does not address agitation or seizures. Typically used as an adjunct to benzodiazepines, not monotherapy.  
- **Option 3 (Diazepam)**: A benzodiazepine that effectively manages agitation, prevents seizures, and treats delirium in alcohol withdrawal. First-line treatment for DTs due to its rapid onset and efficacy.  
- **Option 4 (Haloperidol)**: An antipsychotic used for psychosis in DTs but requires concurrent benzodiazepines. Risk of seizures and extrapyramidal symptoms if used alone. Not first-line.  
- **Option 5 (Phenytoin)**: An anticonvulsant for seizure prophylaxis. DTs are primarily treated with benzodiazepines; phenytoin is unnecessary here.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Diazepam) (地西泮)**  

**Key Evidence**:  
- The patient’s presentation (autonomic hyperactivity, hallucinations, confusion) strongly suggests delirium tremens due to alcohol withdrawal.  
- Benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam) are the **gold-standard first-line treatment** for DTs, addressing agitation, preventing seizures, and resolving delirium.  
- Other options (antipsychotics, clonidine, phenytoin) are either adjunctive, less effective, or unrelated to the primary management of DTs.

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 3 (Diazepam)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 48-year-old man, chronic alcoholism (abruptly quit 5 days ago), no other medical history.  
- **Chief complaint**: Fever (40.0°C), confusion, agitation, hallucinations (tactile: "bugs crawling on skin"), autonomic hyperactivity (tachycardia, hypertension, tachypnea), disorientation.  
- **Key decisive symptoms**:  
  - Acute onset of delirium (confusion, agitation, disorientation) with hallucinations.  
  - Autonomic instability (fever, tachycardia, hypertension).  
  - History of recent alcohol cessation (5 days prior).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline**: Alcohol withdrawal symptoms typically escalate over 48–96 hours after cessation. The onset of severe symptoms (day 5) aligns with delayed complications like **delirium tremens (DTs)**.  
- **Hallucinations and autonomic instability**: Hallucinations (tactile/visual) and autonomic hyperactivity (fever, tachycardia) are hallmark features of DTs. Fever >39.4°C (103°F) is uncommon in uncomplicated alcohol withdrawal, supporting DTs.  
- **Exclusion of alternatives**:  
  - No history of seizures (reducing suspicion for phenytoin need).  
  - No signs of infection (though fever requires monitoring).  
  - Agitation/psychosis in DTs differs from primary psychiatric disorders (e.g., schizophrenia), which lack autonomic instability.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Chlorpromazine (Antipsychotic)**: May reduce agitation but risks lowering seizure threshold and exacerbating hyperthermia. Contraindicated in DTs due to autonomic instability.  
2. **Clonidine (Alpha-2 agonist)**: Reduces sympathetic hyperactivity but does not treat delirium or prevent seizures. Adjunct only.  
3. **Diazepam (Benzodiazepine)**: First-line for alcohol withdrawal/DTs. Reduces agitation, prevents seizures, and mitigates autonomic overdrive via GABA modulation. Long-acting benzos (e.g., diazepam) are preferred for sustained effect.  
4. **Haloperidol (Antipsychotic)**: May control psychosis but lacks efficacy against seizures/autonomic instability. Risks QT prolongation and worsening hyperthermia.  
5. **Phenytoin (Anticonvulsant)**: Prevents seizures but does not address delirium or autonomic symptoms. Benzodiazepines remain superior for alcohol withdrawal seizures.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Diazepam)(地西泮)**  
- **Key evidence**:  
  - The patient meets criteria for **delirium tremens** (autonomic hyperactivity, delirium, hallucinations, recent alcohol cessation).  
  - Benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam) are the cornerstone of DTs treatment: they reduce mortality, control agitation, prevent seizures, and stabilize autonomic symptoms.  
  - High fever and tachycardia necessitate rapid GABAergic suppression, which antipsychotics (Options 1, 4) fail to provide.  
  - Phenytoin (Option 5) is irrelevant without a history of pre-existing seizure disorder.
