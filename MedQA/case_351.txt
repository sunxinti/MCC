Case_description: 
A 26-year-old nurse comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of fatigue. She has had a lot of stress at work and has been on sick leave for 2 weeks, but states that she would like to return to work. She has had several episodes of lower abdominal pain. She says, ""I know I have cancer."" She requests a diagnostic laparoscopy. She was diagnosed with peptic ulcer disease 6 months ago. Her only medication is omeprazole. The patient appears pale. Her temperature is 36.5° C (97.7° F), pulse is 120/min, and blood pressure is 90/65 mm Hg. On mental status examination she is tired and has a depressed mood. Physical examination shows pale conjunctivae and dry mucous membranes. There are numerous crusts along the course of her left arm veins. A grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur is heard along the right-upper sternal border. Abdominal examination shows no abnormalities. There is generalized weakness of the proximal muscles. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 7.5 g/dL
Mean corpuscular volume 89 μm3
Reticulocyte count 13.3%
Serum
Sodium 139 mEq/L
Potassium 3.9 mEq/L
Calcium 8.5 mg/dL
Test of the stool for occult blood is negative. Abdominal ultrasonography show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?"

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**
- **Patient Information:** A 26-year-old female nurse.
- **Chief Complaint:** 2-month history of fatigue.
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**
  - Episodes of lower abdominal pain.
  - Statement indicating knowledge of having cancer.
  - Request for diagnostic laparoscopy.
  - History of peptic ulcer disease diagnosed 6 months ago, currently on omeprazole.
  - Physical Signs:
    - Pallor (pale conjunctivae).
    - Tachycardia (pulse 120/min).
    - Hypotension (blood pressure 90/65 mm Hg).
    - Dry mucous membranes.
    - Numerous crusts along left arm veins.
    - Grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.
    - Generalized proximal muscle weakness.
  - Laboratory Findings:
    - Hemoglobin: 7.5 g/dL (low).
    - Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV): 89 μm³ (normocytic).
    - Reticulocyte count: 13.3% (elevated).
    - Stool occult blood: Negative.
  - Abdominal ultrasonography: No abnormalities.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**
- **Fatigue and Anemia:** The patient presents with significant fatigue and a hemoglobin level of 7.5 g/dL. The normocytic anemia with an elevated reticulocyte count suggests either hemolytic anemia or acute blood loss.
- **Negative Stool Occult Blood:** Despite a history of peptic ulcer disease, the negative stool occult blood test makes chronic gastrointestinal bleeding less likely.
- **Crusts on Veins:** The presence of crusts along the left arm veins may indicate self-administration of intravenous substances, suggesting possible self-harm or medication misuse.
- **Psychological Indicators:** The patient expresses a belief of having cancer without clinical evidence and requests invasive diagnostic procedures, which may indicate a psychological component.
- **Vital Signs and Physical Exam:** Tachycardia and hypotension may be compensatory for anemia. Dry mucous membranes could indicate dehydration or other chronic conditions.
- **Lack of Abdominal Findings:** Normal abdominal ultrasonography and absence of physical abdominal abnormalities reduce the likelihood of acute abdominal pathology.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**
- **Option 1: Factitious Disorder**
  - **Alignment:** The intentional production or feigning of symptoms for psychological reasons fits the clinical picture. The patient's medical background as a nurse may facilitate the knowledge required to mimic or induce symptoms. The presence of crusts on veins suggests potential self-injection or manipulation.
- **Option 2: Somatic Symptom Disorder**
  - **Alignment:** While there is excessive concern about physical symptoms, there is evidence of intentional symptom production, which is more characteristic of factitious disorder.
- **Option 3: Conversion Disorder**
  - **Alignment:** Characterized by neurological symptoms without medical explanation, which does not align with the patient's presentation.
- **Option 4: Primary Hyperparathyroidism**
  - **Alignment:** Typically presents with hypercalcemia, which is not seen in this patient.
- **Option 5: Acute Small Bowel Hemorrhage**
  - **Alignment:** Would likely present with positive stool occult blood and possible hemodynamic instability, which are not consistent with this case.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 1 (Factitious disorder)(克制性障碍)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 1 (Factitious disorder)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 26-year-old nurse presents with 2-month fatigue, pallor, tachycardia (120/min), hypotension (90/65 mmHg), and proximal muscle weakness.  
- Key symptoms include severe anemia (Hb 7.5 g/dL), elevated reticulocyte count (13.3%), pale conjunctivae, dry mucous membranes, left arm vein crusts, and a systolic murmur.  
- She reports lower abdominal pain, insists she has cancer, and requests diagnostic laparoscopy despite normal abdominal imaging and stool tests.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Anemia**: Severe microcytic (MCV 89 μm³) anemia with marked reticulocytosis (13.3%) suggests ongoing or recent blood loss, as the bone marrow is actively compensating.  
- **Vital Signs**: Tachycardia and hypotension align with anemia-induced hemodynamic compromise. The systolic murmur is likely a flow murmur due to tachycardia and low blood viscosity from anemia.  
- **Physical Findings**: Left arm vein crusts hint at repeated venous access or self-injury. Proximal muscle weakness is consistent with severe anemia-induced weakness.  
- **Psychological Component**: The patient’s insistence on having cancer, request for invasive testing, and history of stress suggest a possible factitious or somatic disorder.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Factitious Disorder (Option 1)**:  
  - **Support**: The reticulocytosis suggests active blood loss, but stool occult blood is negative and imaging is normal. The arm vein crusts and her nursing background raise suspicion of self-induced blood loss (e.g., venipuncture). Her insistence on having cancer and seeking unnecessary procedures align with factitious behavior.  
  - **Opposition**: The anemia could theoretically stem from occult GI bleeding, but tests are negative.  

- **Somatic Symptom Disorder (Option 2)**:  
  - **Support**: Exaggerated concern about illness (e.g., insisting on cancer).  
  - **Opposition**: The severe anemia and reticulocytosis require a physical cause, which somatic symptom disorder alone cannot explain.  

- **Conversion Disorder (Option 3)**:  
  - **Opposition**: Muscle weakness here is due to anemia, not psychogenic neurological deficits.  

- **Primary Hyperparathyroidism (Option 4)**:  
  - **Opposition**: Serum calcium is low (8.5 mg/dL), inconsistent with hyperparathyroidism.  

- **Acute Small Bowel Hemorrhage (Option 5)**:  
  - **Opposition**: Normal stool occult blood and abdominal imaging make GI bleeding unlikely.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1 Factitious disorder (Factitious disorder) (诈病)**

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 1 (Factitious disorder)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Profile**: 26-year-old nurse with 2-month fatigue, work stress, and recent sick leave.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Persistent fatigue, lower abdominal pain, and fear of cancer.  
- **Key Clinical Features**:  
  - **Severe anemia**: Hemoglobin 7.5 g/dL (normocytic, MCV 89 μm³), elevated reticulocyte count (13.3%).  
  - **Hypovolemia**: Tachycardia (120/min), hypotension (90/65 mm Hg), dry mucous membranes.  
  - **Physical Signs**: Pale conjunctivae, crusts along left arm veins, systolic ejection murmur, proximal muscle weakness.  
  - **Negative Tests**: Stool occult blood negative, normal abdominal ultrasound.  
  - **Psychiatric Symptoms**: Depressed mood, cancer preoccupation, insistence on invasive procedures.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Anemia and Reticulocytosis**: Normocytic anemia with high reticulocytes suggests acute blood loss or hemolysis. However, **no occult GI bleeding** (negative stool test) and normal imaging exclude common sources of hemorrhage.  
- **Hypovolemia**: Tachycardia, hypotension, and dry mucous membranes indicate volume depletion, likely from **recurrent blood loss**.  
- **Arm Vein Crusts**: Suggest repeated venous trauma (e.g., self-induced bloodletting or injection), aligning with factitious behavior.  
- **Psychiatric Symptoms**: Fixed belief in cancer despite negative evaluations and demand for unnecessary surgery reflect **maladaptive health anxiety or intentional symptom fabrication**.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Factitious Disorder**  
  - **Support**: Unexplained anemia + reticulocytosis + arm vein crusts (self-inflicted blood loss). Medical expertise (nurse) facilitates manipulation. Negative GI workup contradicts organic causes.  
  - **Oppose**: Requires exclusion of other etiologies (achieved via imaging and labs).  
- **Option 2: Somatic Symptom Disorder**  
  - **Support**: Excessive health anxiety (cancer fear).  
  - **Oppose**: Requires disproportionate distress about symptoms, not intentional falsification. Physical findings (anemia, crusts) suggest active manipulation.  
- **Option 3: Conversion Disorder**  
  - **Support**: Proximal weakness could mimic neurological dysfunction.  
  - **Oppose**: No sensory/motor deficits or imaging abnormalities. Anemia and hypovolemia are organic findings.  
- **Option 4: Primary Hyperparathyroidism**  
  - **Oppose**: Normal serum calcium (8.5 mg/dL) excludes this. Muscle weakness here is more likely hypovolemia/anemia-related.  
- **Option 5: Acute Small Bowel Hemorrhage**  
  - **Oppose**: Negative stool occult blood and normal ultrasound make this unlikely. Chronic bleeding would cause iron deficiency (microcytosis), not normocytic anemia.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1 (Factitious disorder) (做作性障碍)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  1. **Unexplained Anemia + Reticulocytosis**: Suggesses blood loss without GI/abdominal source.  
  2. **Arm Vein Crusts**: Indicative of self-inflicted bloodletting.  
  3. **Medical Expertise**: Nurse with knowledge to manipulate tests.  
  4. **Psychiatric Presentation**: Insistence on cancer diagnosis and invasive procedures despite negative evaluations.  
  5. **Exclusion of Organic Causes**: Normal imaging and stool tests rule out hemorrhage or malignancy.  

This pattern aligns with factitious disorder, where physical symptoms are intentionally produced to assume the "sick role."
