**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** 39-year-old woman with a history of thyroidectomy and primary hyperparathyroidism.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Evaluation for surgical removal of a right adrenal mass.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:** 
  - History of thyroidectomy and primary hyperparathyroidism suggests possible Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) syndrome.  
  - Presence of an adrenal mass raises suspicion for pheochromocytoma, a catecholamine-secreting tumor.  
  - Risk of intraoperative hypertensive crises during surgery on adrenal masses like pheochromocytoma.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline:** The patient’s history indicates previous endocrine surgeries, increasing the likelihood of additional endocrine tumors.  
- **Characteristics:** 
  - Adrenal mass in the context of primary hyperparathyroidism suggests a possible pheochromocytoma, especially if associated with MEN syndromes.  
  - Pheochromocytomas secrete catecholamines, which can cause severe hypertension, especially during surgical manipulation of the tumor.  
- **Interrelationships:** Prior thyroidectomy and hyperparathyroidism may indicate a genetic predisposition to multiple endocrine tumors, supporting the likelihood of pheochromocytoma as the adrenal mass.  
- **Supporting Features:** The need to prevent hypertensive emergencies intraoperatively strongly suggests preparation for a catecholamine-secreting tumor like pheochromocytoma.  
- **Opposing Features:** Absence of explicit symptoms such as episodic headaches, palpitations, or sweating, but their absence doesn't rule out pheochromocytoma.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Atenolol (β-blocker)**  
  - **Analysis:** While beta-blockers can manage tachycardia, they do not address alpha-mediated vasoconstriction and can potentially worsen hypertensive crises if used without prior alpha-blockade.  
  - **Conclusion:** Not the first-line agent for preventing hypertensive emergencies in pheochromocytoma.

- **Option 2: Labetolol (α and β-blocker)**  
  - **Analysis:** Has both alpha and beta-blocking properties, which can be beneficial. However, it is generally considered after alpha-blockade has been established.  
  - **Conclusion:** May be used adjunctively but not as the primary agent.

- **Option 3: Lisinopril (ACE inhibitor)**  
  - **Analysis:** Primarily used for managing systemic hypertension but does not specifically counteract catecholamine-induced vasoconstriction effectively in the context of pheochromocytoma.  
  - **Conclusion:** Not the most appropriate choice for preventing intraoperative hypertensive emergencies in this scenario.

- **Option 4: Nifedipine (Calcium channel blocker)**  
  - **Analysis:** Can help in managing hypertension but lacks the specific alpha-blocking effects needed for pheochromocytoma.  
  - **Conclusion:** Not the first-line treatment in this context.

- **Option 5: Phenoxybenzamine (Non-selective α-blocker)**  
  - **Analysis:** The standard preoperative treatment for pheochromocytoma. It irreversibly blocks alpha-adrenergic receptors, preventing catecholamine-induced vasoconstriction and hypertensive crises during surgery.  
  - **Conclusion:** Aligns perfectly with clinical guidelines for managing adrenal masses suspected to be pheochromocytomas.

**My final selection is: Option 5 (Phenoxybenzamine) 苯氧苯胺**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 5 (Phenoxybenzamine)

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 39-year-old woman with a history of thyroidectomy and primary hyperparathyroidism presents for surgical evaluation of a right adrenal mass.  
- The critical concern is preventing a hypertensive emergency during surgery, implying the adrenal mass may secrete catecholamines (e.g., pheochromocytoma).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Adrenal Mass and Hypertensive Risk**: Adrenal masses associated with catecholamine excess (e.g., pheochromocytoma) pose a high risk of intraoperative hypertensive crisis due to uncontrolled catecholamine release during manipulation or anesthesia.  
- **Historical Context**: The patient’s history of hyperparathyroidism is unrelated but highlights prior endocrine surgery, suggesting a possible functional adrenal lesion.  
- **Preoperative Management**: The priority is blocking catecholamine effects. Alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade is essential to prevent unopposed vasoconstriction (alpha effects), which causes hypertension. Beta-blockade alone risks precipitating hypertensive crisis by unmasking unopposed alpha effects.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (Atenolol)**: A beta-blocker. Use **contraindicated** without prior alpha blockade, as it may worsen hypertension by blocking beta-mediated vasodilation, leaving unopposed alpha effects.  
- **Option 2 (Labetolol)**: Combines alpha-1 and beta blockade. While effective, **alpha blockade must be established first** with a pure alpha-blocker (e.g., phenoxybenzamine) before adding labetolol.  
- **Option 3 (Lisinopril)**: An ACE inhibitor. Ineffective for catecholamine-induced hypertension, as it targets the renin-angiotensin system, not direct adrenergic effects.  
- **Option 4 (Nifedipine)**: A calcium channel blocker (CCB). May lower blood pressure but risks reflex tachycardia and is **not first-line** for pheochromocytoma due to lack of alpha blockade.  
- **Option 5 (Phenoxybenzamine)**: A non-selective alpha-adrenergic blocker. **Gold-standard preoperative treatment** for pheochromocytoma. Provides sustained alpha blockade to prevent hypertensive crisis by blocking vasoconstriction.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 5 (Phenoxybenzamine)(酚妥拉明)**  

**Key Evidence**:  
- Pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma surgery requires **preoperative alpha-adrenergic blockade** to prevent hypertensive crisis.  
- Phenoxybenzamine is the classic first-line agent, providing irreversible alpha blockade to mitigate vasoconstriction. Other options (e.g., labetolol, nifedipine) are secondary or insufficient alone.  
- Beta-blockers (atenolol) are contraindicated without prior alpha blockade due to risk of unopposed alpha effects.

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 5 (Phenoxybenzamine)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Profile**: 39-year-old woman with a history of thyroidectomy and primary hyperparathyroidism.  
- **Chief Concern**: Surgical evaluation for a right adrenal mass.  
- **Key Clinical Focus**: Prevention of intraoperative hypertensive emergency.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Adrenal Mass Significance**: A right adrenal mass raises suspicion for **pheochromocytoma**, a catecholamine-secreting tumor. Hypertensive crises during surgery are a hallmark risk due to tumor manipulation triggering catecholamine release.  
- **Relevant History**: Primary hyperparathyroidism (often linked to multiple endocrine neoplasia [MEN] syndromes, which are associated with pheochromocytoma).  
- **Critical Preoperative Need**: Alpha-adrenergic blockade to prevent catecholamine-induced vasoconstriction and hypertensive emergencies.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Atenolol (Beta-1 selective blocker)**  
  - Risk of unopposed alpha-adrenergic activity if used alone, worsening hypertension. Beta-blockers should only follow alpha-blockade in pheochromocytoma management.  
- **Option 2: Labetalol (Combined alpha/beta-blocker)**  
  - Weak alpha-blockade and predominant beta-blockade may inadequately control hypertension. Not first-line for pheochromocytoma.  
- **Option 3: Lisinopril (ACE inhibitor)**  
  - No role in preventing catecholamine-induced hypertension.  
- **Option 4: Nifedipine (Calcium channel blocker)**  
  - May be adjunctive but lacks robust evidence as monotherapy for preoperative preparation.  
- **Option 5: Phenoxybenzamine (Non-selective alpha-blocker)**  
  - **Gold standard** for preoperative management of pheochromocytoma. Blocks alpha receptors, preventing catecholamine-induced vasoconstriction and hypertensive crises.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 5 (Phenoxybenzamine)(酚苄明)**  
- **Key Evidence**: Pheochromocytoma is the primary concern for an adrenal mass with hypertensive crisis risk. Phenoxybenzamine’s irreversible alpha-blockade is guideline-recommended to stabilize blood pressure preoperatively. Beta-blockers (e.g., atenolol, labetalol) are contraindicated before alpha-blockade.
