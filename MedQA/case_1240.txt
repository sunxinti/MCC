GPT's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**
- **Patient Information:** A 3-year-old male.
- **Chief Complaint:** Severe lip lacerations, apparent biting off a portion of the tongue, and missing portions of the fingers on his right hand.
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**
  - Self-injurious behavior (biting lips and tongue, finger mutilation).
  - High level of uric acid on urinalysis.
  - Family history of similar cases in male cousins on the mother's side.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**
- **Self-Injurious Behavior:** The severe self-mutilation observed (lip and tongue biting, finger injuries) is characteristic of certain neurodevelopmental disorders.
- **Hyperuricemia:** Elevated uric acid levels suggest a disorder affecting purine metabolism.
- **Family History:** The occurrence of similar symptoms in male relatives on the maternal side indicates a potential hereditary pattern linked to the X chromosome.
- **Gender Predilection:** Predominantly affects males, aligning with X-linked genetic disorders.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**
- **Option 1: X-linked Recessive**
  - **Alignment:** Conditions like Lesch-Nyhan syndrome fit this inheritance pattern, presenting with hyperuricemia and self-mutilating behaviors in males.
- **Option 2: X-linked Dominant**
  - **Mismatch:** Usually affects both genders, often more severe in males, but less commonly associated with the specific combination of symptoms presented.
- **Option 3: Autosomal Dominant**
  - **Mismatch:** Does not explain the male predominance and maternal side inheritance pattern.
- **Option 4: Autosomal Recessive**
  - **Mismatch:** Would typically require both parents to be carriers, not specifically linked to the maternal side or male predominance.
- **Option 5: Maternally Inherited Mitochondrial Defect**
  - **Mismatch:** Mitochondrial disorders are passed from mothers to all offspring, regardless of gender, and the symptom profile does not align closely.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 1 (X-linked recessive)(X连锁隐性)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 1 (X-linked recessive)

Qwen's full response:

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 3-year-old male presents with severe lip lacerations, a portion of the tongue appearing bitten off, and missing fingers on his right hand.  
- Family history reveals similar cases in two male cousins on the mother’s side.  
- Urinalysis shows elevated uric acid levels.  
- **Decisive features**: Male gender, autosomal injury-like symptoms (self-mutilation), familial recurrence in males on the maternal side, and hyperuricemia.  

---

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Physical injuries**: The lip and tongue lacerations, along with finger loss, suggest self-mutilation rather than accidental trauma. This aligns with conditions causing compulsive self-injury.  
- **Family history**: Affected males are related through the mother’s side, pointing to an X-linked pattern.  
- **Hyperuricemia**: Elevated uric acid in urine supports metabolic disorders, such as Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (X-linked recessive), which is characterized by hyperuricemia, neurologic dysfunction, and self-mutilating behavior.  
- **Gender predilection**: The exclusive involvement of males in the family supports X-linked recessive inheritance, as females are typically carriers.  

---

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (X-linked recessive)**:  
  - **Support**:  
    - Affected males clustered on the maternal side (carrier mother).  
    - Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (X-linked recessive) fits the hyperuricemia, neurologic symptoms (leading to self-injury), and male predominance.  
    - Tongue and lip biting are hallmark features of Lesch-Nyhan.  
  - **Opposition**: None of the features contradict this.  

- **Option 2 (X-linked dominant)**:  
  - **Opposition**: X-linked dominant disorders affect both males and females, often with maternal transmission. Since only males are affected here, this is unlikely.  

- **Option 3 (Autosomal dominant)**:  
  - **Opposition**: Autosomal dominant would require an affected parent or de novo mutation. The family history does not mention parental involvement, and the maternal-side clustering favors X-linked.  

- **Option 4 (Autosomal recessive)**:  
  - **Opposition**: Autosomal recessive requires both parents to be carriers. The pattern here (maternal-side affected males) is more consistent with X-linked recessive.  

- **Option 5 (Mitochondrial defect)**:  
  - **Opposition**: Mitochondrial disorders are maternally inherited but typically affect both sexes. The male-specific pattern here does not fit.  

---

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1 (X-linked recessive)(X染色体隐性遗传)**  

**Key evidence**:  
- The exclusive involvement of males in the family and maternal transmission strongly suggest X-linked recessive inheritance.  
- Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, a classic X-linked recessive disorder, explains hyperuricemia and self-mutilating behavior (leading to the observed injuries).  
- The absence of affected females aligns with X-linked recessive, where carrier females rarely show symptoms.

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 1 (X-linked recessive)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient:** 3-year-old male.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Severe lip lacerations, partial tongue amputation (bitten off), and missing finger portions on the right hand.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - Self-injurious behavior (lip/tongue biting, finger mutilation).  
  - Hyperuricemia (elevated uric acid on urinalysis).  
  - Family history of similar symptoms in male cousins on the maternal side.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Self-Injurious Behavior:** Classic feature of **Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS)**, an X-linked recessive disorder caused by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) deficiency. This enzyme defect leads to uric acid overproduction and neurological dysfunction.  
- **Hyperuricemia:** Supports a purine metabolism disorder, consistent with LNS.  
- **Family History:** Affected male cousins on the maternal side suggest X-linked inheritance (mother is a carrier, passing the mutated X chromosome to sons).  
- **Gender-Specificity:** Only males are typically affected in X-linked recessive disorders, aligning with the case and family history.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: X-linked recessive**  
  - Matches LNS: self-mutilation, hyperuricemia, X-linked inheritance.  
  - Family history (affected males linked through maternal line) strongly supports this.  
- **Option 2: X-linked dominant**  
  - Unlikely, as affected females would also be symptomatic (no evidence here).  
- **Option 3: Autosomal dominant**  
  - Requires an affected parent (not mentioned), and does not explain male predominance.  
- **Option 4: Autosomal recessive**  
  - Less likely due to male-only cases and maternal-side family history (autosomal would require mutations from both parents).  
- **Option 5: Mitochondrial defect**  
  - Maternal inheritance affects both sexes equally, inconsistent with male-only presentation.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1 (X-linked recessive)(X连锁隐性遗传)**  
- **Key Evidence:**  
  1. Self-injurious behavior and hyperuricemia are pathognomonic for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.  
  2. X-linked recessive inheritance explains male-only cases and maternal family history.  
  3. Autosomal or mitochondrial patterns are inconsistent with clinical and familial features.
