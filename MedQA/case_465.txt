Case_description: 
A 45-year-old female presents to the emergency department with gross hematuria and acute, colicky flank pain. She denies any previous episodes of hematuria. She reports taking high doses of acetaminophen and aspirin over several weeks due to persistent upper back pain. The patient’s blood pressure and temperature are normal, but she is found to have proteinuria. Physical examination is negative for palpable flank masses. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis:
Options: 
1. Diffuse cortical necrosis
2. Chronic pyelonephritis
3. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease
4. Papillary necrosis
5. Acute Nephrolithiasis
Correct Answer: Papillary necrosis

GPT's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** 45-year-old female.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Gross hematuria and acute, colicky flank pain.  
- **Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - No previous episodes of hematuria.  
  - History of taking high doses of acetaminophen and aspirin over several weeks for persistent upper back pain.  
  - Normal blood pressure and temperature.  
  - Presence of proteinuria.  
  - Physical examination negative for palpable flank masses.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Gross Hematuria and Acute Flank Pain:** These symptoms are typically associated with renal or urological conditions such as nephrolithiasis or papillary necrosis.  
- **History of High-Dose Analgesic Use:** Prolonged use of analgesics like acetaminophen and aspirin is a known risk factor for analgesic nephropathy, which can lead to papillary necrosis.  
- **Proteinuria:** Suggests some degree of renal impairment, which can be seen in both nephrolithiasis and papillary necrosis but is more strongly associated with chronic renal conditions.  
- **Absence of Palpable Flank Masses:** Makes conditions like autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease less likely.  
- **Normal Blood Pressure and Temperature:** Less supportive of infectious etiologies like acute pyelonephritis and severe ischemic conditions like diffuse cortical necrosis.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Diffuse Cortical Necrosis:**  
   - **Unlikely.** Typically associated with severe ischemic events, sepsis, or obstetric catastrophes, which are not present in this case.

2. **Chronic Pyelonephritis:**  
   - **Unlikely.** Usually presents with recurrent urinary tract infections and chronic symptoms rather than acute hematuria and flank pain.

3. **Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease:**  
   - **Unlikely.** Often presents with multiple renal cysts, hypertension, and possible palpable flank masses, none of which are evident here.

4. **Papillary Necrosis:**  
   - **Likely.** Strongly associated with prolonged use of analgesics (analgesic nephropathy). Presents with gross hematuria and flank pain, aligning well with the patient's symptoms.

5. **Acute Nephrolithiasis:**  
   - **Possible but Less Likely.** While it presents with similar symptoms, the significant history of high-dose analgesic use makes papillary necrosis a more probable diagnosis.

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 4 (Papillary necrosis)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 45-year-old female presents with acute, colicky flank pain and gross hematuria. She has no prior history of hematuria but reports prolonged use of high-dose acetaminophen and aspirin over several weeks for upper back pain.  
- Key symptoms include acute flank pain (colicky), hematuria, and proteinuria. The absence of fever, hypertension, or palpable masses is notable.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Colicky flank pain and hematuria**: These are classic for ureteral obstruction (e.g., kidney stones) or renal parenchymal injury. However, the prolonged NSAID/acetaminophen use raises concerns for drug-induced renal injury.  
- **Proteinuria**: Suggests glomerular or tubulointerstitial damage. Papillary necrosis can cause proteinuria due to papillary sloughing and renal parenchymal injury.  
- **Timeline**: Symptoms developed over weeks of NSAID/acetaminophen use, aligning with a chronic injury process rather than an acute stone event.  
- **No fever or palpable masses**: Rules out acute pyelonephritis or renal masses (e.g., polycystic kidney disease).  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Diffuse cortical necrosis**: Requires severe hypotension/sepsis, which the patient lacks. Unlikely.  
2. **Chronic pyelonephritis**: Typically presents with chronic symptoms (e.g., recurrent UTIs, hypertension, renal deformity), fever, and flank masses. No evidence here.  
3. **Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)**: Usually presents with bilateral cysts, family history, and chronic hypertension. Acute onset and lack of mass/palpable cysts make this improbable.  
4. **Papillary necrosis**: Strongly linked to NSAID/acetaminophen use, causing ischemia and necrosis of renal papillae. Presents with flank pain, hematuria, and proteinuria. Aligns perfectly with the patient’s medication history and symptoms.  
5. **Acute nephrolithiasis**: Classic colicky pain and hematuria are features, but prolonged NSAID use is a risk factor for papillary necrosis, which can mimic stone symptoms (e.g., papillary sloughing causing obstruction or bleeding). The absence of imaging findings (not provided) and the medication history favor papillary necrosis over stones.

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 4 (Papillary necrosis)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient:** 45-year-old female.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Gross hematuria and acute, colicky flank pain.  
- **Key Features:**  
  - Acute onset of colicky flank pain.  
  - Gross hematuria (first episode).  
  - Proteinuria.  
  - History of prolonged high-dose acetaminophen and aspirin use.  
  - Normal blood pressure and temperature; no palpable flank masses.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Acute Flank Pain and Hematuria:** Classic for urinary tract obstruction (e.g., nephrolithiasis) or tissue sloughing (e.g., papillary necrosis). Colicky nature suggests ureteral irritation.  
- **Analgesic Overuse:** Chronic high-dose aspirin and acetaminophen are strongly linked to analgesic nephropathy and papillary necrosis.  
- **Proteinuria:** Mild-to-moderate proteinuria can occur in tubular injury (e.g., papillary necrosis) but is atypical for uncomplicated nephrolithiasis.  
- **Normal Vital Signs:** Absence of fever/hypertension argues against pyelonephritis or ADPKD.  
- **No Flank Masses:** Makes ADPKD less likely (typically presents with enlarged, palpable kidneys).  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Diffuse Cortical Necrosis:** Typically occurs in severe ischemic events (e.g., obstetric shock). Absent in this case. **Excluded.**  
2. **Chronic Pyelonephritis:** Requires recurrent UTIs and chronic symptoms (e.g., fatigue, polyuria). No infection signs (normal temperature, no dysuria). **Unlikely.**  
3. **ADPKD:** Presents with bilateral flank masses, hypertension, and family history. Normal exam and acute onset contradict this. **Excluded.**  
4. **Papillary Necrosis:** Strongly associated with analgesic abuse (aspirin/acetaminophen). Sloughed papillae cause hematuria, colicky pain, and proteinuria. **Highly consistent.**  
5. **Acute Nephrolithiasis:** Colicky pain and hematuria are classic, but proteinuria is uncommon. Analgesic history is unrelated to stone formation. **Possible but less likely than papillary necrosis.**  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Papillary necrosis)(肾乳头坏死)**  
- **Key Evidence:**  
  - History of prolonged high-dose aspirin/acetaminophen use (major risk factor).  
  - Acute hematuria and colicky pain (sloughed papillae mimicking stone-like symptoms).  
  - Proteinuria aligns with tubular injury from papillary necrosis.  
  - Absence of infection, hypertension, or structural kidney disease supports this diagnosis.
