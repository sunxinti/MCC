Case_description: 
A 23-year-old man comes to the clinic for yellowing of his eyes. The patient has been relatively healthy and just recently started “intermittent fasting” to try to lose weight. He recalls a similar episode 4 years ago when he was recovering from an emergency appendectomy. The patient denies smoking but endorses an episode of binge drinking 2 days ago. He is sexually active with both men and women. His physical examination is unremarkable besides scleral icterus. What is the most likely explanation for this patient’s symptoms?
Options: 
1. Autoimmune-mediated fibrosis of biliary tract
2. Chronic viral infection of the liver
3. Decreased activity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase
4. Defective bilirubin excretion
5. Macrovesicular steatosis
Correct Answer: Decreased activity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase

GPT's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** A 23-year-old man.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Yellowing of the eyes (scleral icterus).  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - Recent initiation of intermittent fasting for weight loss.  
  - History of a similar jaundice episode 4 years ago post-emergency appendectomy.  
  - Binge drinking episode 2 days prior to presentation.  
  - Sexually active with both men and women.  
  - Physical examination unremarkable except for scleral icterus.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Intermittent Fasting and Binge Drinking:** These factors can influence liver metabolism and bilirubin levels. Intermittent fasting may lead to mild hemolysis or affect liver enzyme activities, while binge drinking can cause transient liver dysfunction.  
- **Recurrent Episodes:** The recurrence of jaundice, especially triggered by physiological stressors (e.g., surgery, fasting, alcohol intake), suggests an underlying metabolic or genetic condition affecting bilirubin processing.  
- **Scleral Icterus Without Other Symptoms:** The absence of hepatomegaly, abdominal pain, fever, or signs of chronic liver disease indicates a benign and likely unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.  
- **Sexual History:** While sexually active with multiple partners raises concerns for sexually transmitted infections, the absence of relevant symptoms (e.g., hepatitis) makes chronic viral hepatitis less likely.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  

1. **Autoimmune-mediated fibrosis of biliary tract:**  
   - **Likelihood:** Low. Conditions like primary sclerosing cholangitis typically present with progressive jaundice, pruritus, and other systemic symptoms.  
   - **Contrary Features:** Lack of cholestatic symptoms and chronic liver disease signs.

2. **Chronic viral infection of the liver:**  
   - **Likelihood:** Low to Moderate. Chronic hepatitis can cause jaundice, but the patient's lack of risk factors (besides MSM behaviors) and absence of other symptoms make this less likely.  
   - **Contrary Features:** Recurrent, episodic nature is atypical for chronic viral hepatitis, which usually presents with persistent symptoms.

3. **Decreased activity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase:**  
   - **Likelihood:** High. This is characteristic of Gilbert's syndrome, a benign condition leading to intermittent unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, often precipitated by fasting, stress, or alcohol consumption.  
   - **Supporting Features:** Recurrent jaundice triggered by physiological stressors, absence of liver dysfunction signs.

4. **Defective bilirubin excretion:**  
   - **Likelihood:** Low. Conditions like Dubin-Johnson or Rotor syndrome involve conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and may present with other signs.  
   - **Contrary Features:** Patient likely has unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia without evidence of excretion defects.

5. **Macrovesicular steatosis:**  
   - **Likelihood:** Low. Typically associated with fatty liver disease, which presents with hepatomegaly, elevated liver enzymes, and metabolic syndrome features.  
   - **Contrary Features:** Absence of hepatomegaly and metabolic abnormalities.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Decreased activity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase)(UDP-葡糖醛酸转移酶活性降低)**

Qwen is reasoning the answer...

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 3 (Decreased activity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 23-year-old male presents with **scleral icterus** (yellowing of the eyes) and a history of a similar episode 4 years ago during recovery from an **appendectomy**.  
- Recent triggers include **intermittent fasting** for weight loss and **binge drinking** 2 days prior.  
- He is sexually active with both men and women.  
- Physical examination is otherwise normal except for icterus.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Jaundice recurrence with fasting**: The patient’s episodes of jaundice align with periods of caloric restriction (post-appendectomy fasting and current intermittent fasting), suggesting a metabolic trigger.  
- **Binge drinking**: Alcohol can transiently elevate bilirubin, but the timing (2 days prior) may not fully explain the current episode.  
- **Sexual activity**: No specific symptoms (e.g., fatigue, hepatomegaly) suggest chronic infections like hepatitis B/C or HIV, though this requires consideration.  
- **Age and clinical course**: The young age and episodic nature of symptoms make chronic liver disease (e.g., viral hepatitis) or congenital disorders (e.g., Crigler-Najjar) less likely.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Autoimmune-mediated fibrosis of biliary tract (e.g., PSC)**  
  - Unlikely. PSC typically presents with chronic symptoms, pruritus, and links to inflammatory bowel disease, which are absent here. The episodic nature does not fit.  

- **Option 2: Chronic viral infection of the liver (e.g., Hepatitis B/C)**  
  - Less likely. Chronic hepatitis usually causes persistent symptoms and elevated liver enzymes. The patient’s normal physical exam and lack of chronic signs (e.g., fatigue) reduce its likelihood.  

- **Option 3: Decreased activity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (Gilbert’s Syndrome)**  
  - **Most likely**. Gilbert’s Syndrome is a common, benign cause of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, exacerbated by fasting, dehydration, or stress. The patient’s recurrent jaundice during fasting episodes (post-surgery and current diet) aligns perfectly. Labs would show elevated indirect bilirubin without liver enzyme elevation.  

- **Option 4: Defective bilirubin excretion (e.g., Crigler-Najjar syndrome)**  
  - Unlikely. These disorders are typically congenital and cause severe, persistent hyperbilirubinemia from birth. The patient’s episodic pattern contradicts this.  

- **Option 5: Macrovesicular steatosis (fatty liver)**  
  - Less likely. Fatty liver usually causes elevated liver enzymes and may not present with isolated jaundice. The patient’s normal physical exam and lack of obesity (not mentioned) make this less likely.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Decreased activity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase)(UDP葡萄糖醛酸转移酶活性降低)**  

**Key evidence supporting this choice**:  
- The patient’s **recurrent jaundice during fasting or post-surgical recovery** strongly points to Gilbert’s Syndrome, a condition caused by decreased UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity.  
- The absence of chronic symptoms, abnormal liver enzymes, or other systemic findings makes alternative diagnoses less likely.  
- The timing of episodes aligns with known triggers for Gilbert’s Syndrome (fasting, stress).

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 3 (Decreased activity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Basic Information**: 23-year-old man presenting with scleral icterus (yellowing of the eyes).  
- **Chief Complaint**: Jaundice.  
- **Key Clinical Features**:  
  - Recent intermittent fasting for weight loss.  
  - Similar episode 4 years ago post-appendectomy (a physiological stressor).  
  - Binge drinking 2 days prior.  
  - Sexually active with multiple partners.  
  - No other physical abnormalities.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline and Triggers**:  
  - Jaundice occurred intermittently, triggered by fasting (current) and surgical stress (past).  
  - Binge drinking may act as an additional stressor.  
- **Characteristics of Jaundice**:  
  - Isolated scleral icterus without hepatomegaly, abdominal pain, or dark urine.  
  - Suggests **unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia**, as conjugated bilirubin (water-soluble) would likely cause dark urine.  
- **Supporting/Opposing Features**:  
  - **Supports Gilbert’s syndrome**: Stressors (fasting, surgery, alcohol) precipitating transient jaundice.  
  - **Opposes chronic liver disease (viral/autoimmune)**: Lack of chronic symptoms (e.g., fatigue, weight loss) or exam findings (e.g., hepatosplenomegaly).  
  - **Opposes biliary obstruction/defects**: Absence of pruritus, pale stools, or conjugated hyperbilirubinemia features.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Autoimmune-mediated fibrosis of biliary tract (e.g., PSC)**:  
   - Unlikely. Typically presents with chronic cholestasis, pruritus, and progressive symptoms. No evidence of biliary obstruction or fibrosis.  
2. **Chronic viral hepatitis (e.g., HBV/HCV)**:  
   - Possible due to sexual exposure, but chronic infection rarely causes intermittent jaundice without elevated transaminases or systemic symptoms. Acute hepatitis would present with malaise, nausea, and ALT/AST elevation.  
3. **Decreased UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity (Gilbert’s syndrome)**:  
   - **Strongly supported**. Gilbert’s is characterized by mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia triggered by fasting, stress, or illness. Episodic jaundice aligns with the patient’s history.  
4. **Defective bilirubin excretion (e.g., Dubin-Johnson syndrome)**:  
   - Unlikely. Causes **conjugated** hyperbilirubinemia and chronic jaundice, not stress-related episodes.  
5. **Macrovesicular steatosis (e.g., alcoholic/non-alcoholic fatty liver)**:  
   - Unlikely. Jaundice in fatty liver is rare unless advanced (e.g., cirrhosis), which is inconsistent with the patient’s age and lack of chronic liver signs.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Decreased activity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase)(尿苷二磷酸葡萄糖醛酸转移酶活性降低)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Intermittent jaundice triggered by fasting (reduces UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity) and physiological stressors (surgery, alcohol).  
  - Absence of other hepatic/biliary symptoms or findings.  
  - Classic presentation of Gilbert’s syndrome, a benign condition affecting 3–10% of the population.  
  - Chronic viral hepatitis or biliary disorders are less likely given the episodic nature and lack of corroborating signs.
