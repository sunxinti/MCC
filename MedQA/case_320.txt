**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 32-year-old woman with a history of ulcerative colitis presents to the emergency department with a 5-week history of abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, which has worsened over the past 24 hours.  
- Vital signs reveal fever (38.2°C), tachycardia (pulse 120/min), and hypotension (BP 92/56 mm Hg).  
- Physical examination shows a distended, rigid abdomen and hypoactive bowel sounds.  
- The patient has difficulty complying with her ulcerative colitis medication regimen.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Chronic Condition**: The patient has a known history of ulcerative colitis, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that can lead to severe complications if not properly managed.  
- **Acute Exacerbation**: A 5-week history of abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea indicates a possible flare-up of her condition.  
- **Systemic Signs**: Fever, tachycardia, and hypotension suggest systemic inflammatory response, possibly sepsis or toxic megacolon.  
- **Abdominal Findings**: A distended, rigid abdomen with hypoactive bowel sounds is concerning for potential complications such as toxic megacolon, perforation, or severe colitis with impending sepsis.  
- **Non-compliance with Treatment**: Difficulty adhering to her medication regimen increases the risk of severe disease progression and complications.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **1. Double-contrast barium enema**: Typically used for diagnostic imaging of the colon but is contraindicated in acute severe colitis due to the risk of perforation. Not suitable in this emergency setting.  
- **2. Abdominal CT scan with contrast**: Provides detailed imaging to assess for complications like toxic megacolon, perforation, abscesses, or severe colitis. It is highly useful in unstable patients for guiding management.  
- **3. CT angiography**: Primarily used to evaluate vascular structures and is not the first choice for assessing acute complications of ulcerative colitis.  
- **4. Abdominal x-ray**: Can identify gross abnormalities like toxic megacolon or free air from perforation but offers limited detail compared to CT. Useful as an initial rapid assessment but may not provide comprehensive information needed for management.  
- **5. Colonoscopy**: Contraindicated in acute severe colitis due to the high risk of perforation and because it can exacerbate the patient's unstable condition.

Considering the patient's unstable vital signs, acute presentation, and need for detailed evaluation of potential life-threatening complications, an abdominal CT scan with contrast is the most appropriate next step.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2. Abdominal CT scan with contrast (腹部增强CT扫描)**

================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 32-year-old woman with a 1-year history of ulcerative colitis (UC) presents with a 5-week history of worsening abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, now complicated by fever (38.2°C), tachycardia (120/min), hypotension (92/56 mm Hg), distended/rigid abdomen, and hypoactive bowel sounds.  
- **Decisive features**: Acute deterioration with hemodynamic instability, abdominal guarding/rigidity, and hypoactive bowel sounds suggest severe UC complications (e.g., toxic megacolon, perforation, or sepsis).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline**: Chronic UC symptoms worsened over 5 weeks, with acute decompensation in 24 hours. Poor medication compliance likely contributed to disease progression.  
- **Symptoms/Signs**:  
  - **Hemodynamic instability** (fever, tachycardia, hypotension): Suggests systemic inflammation (sepsis) or hypovolemia.  
  - **Distended, rigid abdomen with hypoactive bowel sounds**: Classic for toxic megacolon (severe UC complication) or bowel perforation.  
  - **Absent findings**: No mention of peritoneal signs (e.g., rebound tenderness) or free air on imaging (yet), but hypoactive bowel sounds and rigidity raise concern for perforation or severe ileus.  
- **Disease Context**: UC patients with poor compliance are at higher risk for complications like toxic megacolon, which can progress to perforation or sepsis.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Double-contrast barium enema**  
  - **Contraindicated** in suspected toxic megacolon or perforation due to risk of barium leakage into the peritoneum.  
  - **Not suitable** for acute unstable patients.  

- **Option 2: Abdominal CT scan with contrast**  
  - **Best choice**: CT is the gold standard for evaluating colonic dilation (toxic megacolon), perforation, abscesses, and assessing bowel wall thickening/perforation.  
  - Provides critical information for guiding urgent management (e.g., surgery vs. medical therapy).  
  - Can be performed safely in unstable patients with IV access and monitoring.  

- **Option 3: CT angiography**  
  - **Unlikely needed**: Indicated for vascular complications (e.g., mesenteric ischemia), which are not strongly suggested here.  

- **Option 4: Abdominal X-ray**  
  - May show colonic dilation (e.g., toxic megacolon) or free air (perforation).  
  - **Limited sensitivity**: May miss subtle findings (e.g., early perforation, abscesses) and is not sufficient for definitive diagnosis in this urgent scenario.  

- **Option 5: Colonoscopy**  
  - **Contraindicated** in acute toxic megacolon or suspected perforation due to high perforation risk.  
  - Not feasible in an unstable patient requiring immediate stabilization.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Abdominal CT scan with contrast)(腹部CT扫描增强)**

================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Basic Information**: 32-year-old woman with a history of ulcerative colitis (UC), non-compliant with medications.  
- **Chief Complaint**: 5-week history of abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, worsening over 24 hours.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations**:  
  - Fever (38.2°C), tachycardia (120/min), hypotension (92/56 mmHg) → signs of systemic toxicity/shock.  
  - Distended, rigid abdomen with hypoactive bowel sounds → suggests peritonitis or bowel perforation.  
- **Decisive Findings**: Rigid abdomen, hemodynamic instability, and prior UC flare indicate a high-risk complication (e.g., toxic megacolon, perforation).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline and Progression**: Chronic UC flare (5 weeks) with acute deterioration (24 hours) aligns with complications like toxic megacolon or perforation.  
- **Key Symptom Interrelationships**:  
  - Bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain reflect active UC.  
  - Fever, hypotension, and abdominal rigidity suggest secondary infection (e.g., peritonitis) or colonic dilation.  
- **Notably Absent Findings**: No mention of acute-onset "tearing" pain (dissecting aneurysm) or sudden vomiting (bowel obstruction), which might point to other diagnoses.  
- **Supporting/Opposing Diagnoses**:  
  - UC flare with complications (toxic megacolon, perforation) is strongly supported by rigidity, distension, and hemodynamic instability.  
  - Mesenteric ischemia (CT angiography) is less likely given UC history and absence of sudden, severe ischemia-like pain.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Double-contrast barium enema**: Contraindicated in acute colitis due to perforation risk.  
2. **Abdominal CT scan with contrast**: Ideal for evaluating colonic dilation (toxic megacolon), perforation, abscess, or wall thickening. Aligns with suspected UC complications.  
3. **CT angiography**: Unnecessary unless mesenteric ischemia is suspected (no supporting evidence here).  
4. **Abdominal x-ray**: Rapid but limited sensitivity. May show colonic dilation or free air but lacks detail for abscesses or wall integrity.  
5. **Colonoscopy**: High risk of perforation in a rigid, distended abdomen; contraindicated in acute severe colitis.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Abdominal CT scan with contrast)(对比增强腹部CT扫描)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - CT scan is the gold standard to confirm toxic megacolon (colonic dilation >6 cm), perforation, or abscesses.  
  - Safely rules out life-threatening complications in a hemodynamically unstable patient.  
  - Colonoscopy and barium enema are contraindicated, while x-ray lacks sufficient detail. CT angiography is irrelevant without ischemia signs.
