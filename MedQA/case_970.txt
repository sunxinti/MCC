**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** 67-year-old man with a history of cocaine and heroin use in his 20s and 30s.
- **Chief Complaint:** Feelings of nervousness and anxiety that have become increasingly prominent over the last 2 months.
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - Restlessness and inability to control feelings of nervousness related to daily tasks.
  - Racing thoughts leading to insomnia.
  - Physical symptoms during anxious episodes: heart racing, light-headedness, dizziness, and blacking out.
  - Chronic back and neck pain with increased muscle tension.
  - Intermittent anxiety symptoms present over the last year.
  - No current smoking or alcohol use.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline:** The patient has experienced intermittent anxiety over the past year, with a significant exacerbation in the last 2 months.
- **Characteristics of Symptoms:**  
  - Psychological: Persistent and excessive worry, restlessness, racing thoughts.
  - Physical: Tachycardia, light-headedness, dizziness, syncope, muscle tension, and chronic pain.
- **Interrelationships:** The combination of psychological and physical symptoms aligns with an anxiety disorder, particularly Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). The presence of muscle tension and chronic pain further supports GAD. Insomnia related to racing thoughts and physical symptoms during anxiety episodes are consistent with this diagnosis.
- **Supporting Features for Diagnosis:**  
  - Duration of symptoms exceeds 6 months.
  - Presence of both psychological and physical symptoms.
  - Difficulty controlling worry.
- **Opposing Features:** No significant signs suggestive of other anxiety disorders like panic disorder or specific phobias. Absence of depressive symptoms or other psychiatric conditions based on provided information.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Diazepam (地西泮)**  
  - **Pros:** Effective for acute anxiety relief.
  - **Cons:** Risk of dependence and tolerance, especially concerning given the patient's history of substance abuse.
  - **Alignment:** Not ideal due to potential for abuse and dependence.
  
- **Option 2: Zolpidem (唑吡坦)**  
  - **Pros:** Effective for insomnia.
  - **Cons:** Does not address underlying anxiety; risk of dependence.
  - **Alignment:** Not suitable as primary treatment for anxiety.
  
- **Option 3: Ramelteon (雷美替隆)**  
  - **Pros:** Non-habit forming, effective for sleep onset.
  - **Cons:** Does not address anxiety symptoms.
  - **Alignment:** Not appropriate as primary treatment for anxiety.
  
- **Option 4: Buspirone (布斯匹酮)**  
  - **Pros:** Effective for GAD, non-benzodiazepine, low risk of dependence, suitable for long-term management.
  - **Cons:** May take several weeks to achieve full effect.
  - **Alignment:** Aligns well with GAD diagnosis, especially considering the patient's history of substance abuse.
  
- **Option 5: Alprazolam (阿普唑仑)**  
  - **Pros:** Effective anxiolytic.
  - **Cons:** High risk of dependence and abuse, especially in patients with a history of substance use.
  - **Alignment:** Less suitable due to abuse potential.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Buspirone) (布斯匹酮)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 4 (Buspirone)

Qwen's full response:

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 67-year-old male presents with persistent anxiety, restlessness, and uncontrollable nervousness worsening over the past 2 months. Key symptoms include racing thoughts, insomnia due to excessive worry, tachycardia, lightheadedness/dizziness (occasionally leading to blackouts), and muscle tension in the back and neck.  
- Decisive symptoms: Chronic anxiety with physical manifestations (tachycardia, dizziness, muscle tension) and a history of substance use (cocaine/heroin decades prior).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Anxiety and Restlessness**: The patient’s symptoms align with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), characterized by excessive worry about daily tasks, restlessness, and somatic symptoms.  
- **Timeline**: Symptoms have persisted for a year but intensified recently, suggesting a chronic condition requiring sustained management.  
- **Physical Symptoms**: Tachycardia and lightheadedness likely stem from anxiety-induced sympathetic overactivity. Muscle tension in the back and neck may reflect chronic anxiety-related somatization.  
- **Substance History**: Past cocaine/heroin use raises concern for potential addictive behaviors, making benzodiazepine use high-risk due to dependence liability.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Diazepam (Option 1)**: A benzodiazepine effective for acute anxiety but poses significant addiction risk, especially given the patient’s history of substance use. Long-term use is contraindicated.  
- **Zolpidem (Option 2)**: A sedative-hypnotic for insomnia. While it may address sleep disruption, it does not target the underlying anxiety and carries abuse potential.  
- **Ramelteon (Option 3)**: A melatonin agonist for insomnia. It lacks efficacy for anxiety and would not address the primary issue.  
- **Buspirone (Option 4)**: A non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic with no addiction risk. It effectively treats GAD and somatic symptoms like muscle tension. Its slower onset (2–3 weeks) is acceptable for chronic symptoms.  
- **Alprazolam (Option 5)**: Another benzodiazepine with rapid onset but high addiction risk. Contraindicated due to the patient’s history of substance use.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Buspirone) (布司必利)**  

**Key Evidence Supporting Choice**:  
- Buspirone is the only non-addictive anxiolytic listed, critical for a patient with a history of substance use.  
- It addresses core anxiety symptoms (restlessness, racing thoughts, muscle tension) and aligns with chronic symptom management.  
- Benzodiazepines (Options 1 and 5) are contraindicated due to dependence risk, while Zolpidem/Ramelteon (Options 2 and 3) focus on insomnia rather than anxiety.

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 67-year-old man with a history of past cocaine/heroin use (no current substance use).  
- **Chief Complaint**: Persistent anxiety, restlessness, and inability to control nervousness about daily tasks, worsening over 2 months (intermittent for 1 year).  
- **Key Symptoms**:  
  - Racing thoughts, insomnia.  
  - Tachycardia, light-headedness, dizziness (near-syncope).  
  - Muscle tension with neck/back pain.  
- **Decisive Features**: Chronic anxiety with physical manifestations (palpitations, dizziness, muscle tension), history of substance use, and age-related safety considerations.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline**: Chronic anxiety (1 year) with acute exacerbation (2 months). Symptoms align with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or somatic manifestations of anxiety.  
- **Symptom Interrelationships**: Anxiety-driven hyperarousal (racing thoughts, insomnia) likely triggers autonomic symptoms (tachycardia, dizziness) and muscle tension. Near-syncope may reflect hyperventilation or vasovagal responses.  
- **Supporting/Opposing Factors**:  
  - **Supports GAD**: Chronicity, cognitive and somatic anxiety symptoms.  
  - **Opposes Benzodiazepines**: History of substance use disorder (cocaine/heroin) increases addiction risk.  
  - **Age Considerations**: Older adults are more prone to benzodiazepine adverse effects (e.g., falls, cognitive impairment).  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Diazepam (Option 1)**: Benzodiazepine effective for acute anxiety but high abuse potential and contraindicated in substance use history.  
2. **Zolpidem (Option 2)**: Hypnotic for insomnia; does not address anxiety core symptoms.  
3. **Ramelteon (Option 3)**: Melatonin agonist for sleep onset; irrelevant to anxiety or muscle tension.  
4. **Buspirone (Option 4)**: First-line for GAD in older adults; non-addictive, reduces somatic symptoms (muscle tension), and safe in substance use history.  
5. **Alprazolam (Option 5)**: Short-acting benzodiazepine with rapid tolerance/dependence risk; inappropriate given patient’s history.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Buspirone)(丁螺环酮)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - **Safety**: Non-benzodiazepine, no abuse potential (critical for a patient with prior substance use).  
  - **Efficacy**: Targets chronic anxiety and somatic symptoms (muscle tension).  
  - **Guideline Adherence**: Recommended as first-line for GAD in elderly patients and those with substance use history.
