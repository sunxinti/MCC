**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** 25-year-old woman, height 170 cm, weight 73 kg, BMI 25.3 kg/m².  
- **Chief Complaint:** Irregular menstrual bleeding with intervals ranging from 30 to 90 days since menarche at age 12.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - Oily skin and severe facial acne.  
  - Hirsutism: dark hair on the upper lip and around both nipples.  
  - Laboratory Findings: Elevated Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (6.2 μg/mL), elevated LH (160 mIU/mL), elevated Testosterone (4.1 nmol/L).  
  - Negative urine pregnancy test.  
- **Decisive Features:** Irregular menstrual cycles combined with signs of hyperandrogenism (acne, hirsutism) and elevated androgen levels suggest an underlying endocrine disorder, most likely Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Menstrual Irregularity:** The patient has oligomenorrhea, with menstrual intervals ranging from 30 to 90 days, which is consistent with anovulatory cycles commonly seen in PCOS.  
- **Hyperandrogenism:** Oily skin, severe acne, and hirsutism indicate increased androgen levels, further supporting the diagnosis of PCOS.  
- **Laboratory Findings:**  
  - Elevated LH and LH/FSH ratio are classic findings in PCOS.  
  - Elevated Testosterone levels confirm hyperandrogenism.  
  - Increased Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate suggests adrenal androgen excess, which is also seen in PCOS.  
- **BMI and Metabolic Considerations:** With a BMI of 25.3 kg/m², the patient is in the overweight category, which is a risk factor for insulin resistance and associated metabolic comorbidities in PCOS.  
- **Sexual Activity and Fertility:** Given that the patient is sexually active without contraception, there is a potential risk for infertility, which is a concern in PCOS.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: 17-hydroxyprogesterone and cortisol level measurements**  
  - **Analysis:** These tests are primarily used to evaluate congenital adrenal hyperplasia or Cushing's syndrome. While androgen excess is present, the clinical picture aligns more with PCOS than these conditions.  
  - **Likelihood:** Less likely.

- **Option 2: CA-125 level measurement**  
  - **Analysis:** CA-125 is a tumor marker associated with ovarian cancer. The patient is young with no significant risk factors for ovarian malignancy.  
  - **Likelihood:** Unlikely and not indicated in this context.

- **Option 3: Blood glucose and cholesterol level measurements**  
  - **Analysis:** PCOS is associated with insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Screening for blood glucose and cholesterol is essential to identify metabolic comorbidities and prevent long-term complications.  
  - **Likelihood:** Highly relevant and aligns with clinical guidelines for PCOS management.

- **Option 4: TSH and T4 level measurements**  
  - **Analysis:** Thyroid dysfunction can cause menstrual irregularities but is unrelated to hyperandrogenism. While it can be considered, it is not the most immediate concern given the presentation.  
  - **Likelihood:** Possible but secondary.

- **Option 5: Transvaginal ultrasonography**  
  - **Analysis:** Useful for diagnosing polycystic ovaries in PCOS; however, the question focuses on screening for comorbidities rather than confirming the diagnosis.  
  - **Likelihood:** Relevant for diagnosis but not for comorbidity screening.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Blood glucose and cholesterol level measurements) (血糖和胆固醇水平测量)**

Qwen is reasoning the answer...

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 3 (Blood glucose and cholesterol level measurements)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 25-year-old woman with a history of irregular menstrual cycles (30–90 days) since menarche at age 12.  
- Current symptoms include amenorrhea for 6 weeks, hirsutism (upper lip and nipples), oily skin, and severe facial acne.  
- Labs show elevated dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S: 6.2 μg/mL), markedly elevated luteinizing hormone (LH: 160 mIU/mL), and slightly elevated testosterone (4.1 nmol/L).  
- Negative urine pregnancy test. BMI is 25.3 kg/m² (overweight).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Key features**:  
  - **Irregular menses and anovulation**: Suggests disorders of ovulation, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).  
  - **Hyperandrogenism**: Hirsutism, acne, and elevated testosterone and DHEA-S indicate androgen excess.  
  - **Elevated LH/FSH ratio**: LH (160 mIU/mL) is disproportionately high compared to FSH (20 mIU/mL), a hallmark of PCOS.  
- **Timeline**: Symptoms began at menarche, consistent with chronic endocrine dysfunction.  
- **Interpretation**: The combination of menstrual irregularity, clinical hyperandrogenism, and elevated LH strongly supports PCOS. The labs rule out pregnancy and primary ovarian failure (normal FSH).  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (17-hydroxyprogesterone and cortisol)**:  
  - Indicates suspicion for congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). However, DHEA-S elevation alone does not confirm adrenal origin, and LH elevation in PCOS is typically due to ovarian androgen excess, not adrenal pathology. Unnecessary unless severe virilization is present.  
- **Option 2 (CA-125)**:  
  - Used to screen for ovarian cancer. Unlikely in this young patient with no mass or ascites, and CA-125 is nonspecific for malignancy.  
- **Option 3 (Blood glucose and cholesterol)**:  
  - **Strongly indicated**: PCOS is associated with insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Screening for metabolic comorbidities is standard in PCOS management.  
- **Option 4 (TSH and T4)**:  
  - Thyroid dysfunction can cause menstrual irregularity, but the LH/FSH ratio and hyperandrogenism favor PCOS over thyroid disease. However, thyroid testing is reasonable but lower priority than metabolic screening.  
- **Option 5 (Transvaginal ultrasonography)**:  
  - Useful to confirm ovarian morphology in PCOS (polycystic ovaries). However, the question specifies screening for *comorbidities*, not diagnostic confirmation.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Blood glucose and cholesterol level measurements)(血糖和胆固醇水平检测)**  

**Key Evidence**:  
- The patient’s clinical and lab findings are consistent with PCOS.  
- PCOS is strongly associated with metabolic comorbidities like insulin resistance, prediabetes, and dyslipidemia.  
- Early metabolic screening is critical for risk stratification and prevention of long-term complications (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular disease).  
- Other options (e.g., thyroid testing) are less urgent, and imaging is not required for comorbidity screening.

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 3 (Blood glucose and cholesterol level measurements)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Basic Information**: 25-year-old woman with a history of irregular menstrual cycles (30–90 days) since menarche at age 12. Sexually active, non-condom use, negative pregnancy test. BMI 25.3 (overweight).  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations**:  
  - Oligomenorrhea (irregular cycles, last menstrual period 6 weeks ago).  
  - Hyperandrogenism: severe acne, oily skin, hirsutism (upper lip, periareolar hair).  
  - Elevated androgens: testosterone (4.1 nmol/L, >3.5) and DHEAS (6.2 μg/mL, >5.4).  
  - Elevated LH/FSH ratio (160/20 = 8:1).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline and Symptoms**: Chronic oligomenorrhea since menarche, progressive hyperandrogenic features (acne, hirsutism). Labs confirm androgen excess and elevated LH/FSH ratio, consistent with **polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)**.  
- **Support for PCOS**:  
  - Rotterdam criteria met: (1) oligo-ovulation, (2) clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism.  
  - LH/FSH ratio >2:1 supports PCOS pathophysiology (hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis dysfunction).  
- **Opposing Other Diagnoses**:  
  - Negative pregnancy test excludes pregnancy-related amenorrhea.  
  - No thyroid symptoms (e.g., weight changes, fatigue) or adrenal hyperplasia features (e.g., virilization, rapid onset).  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **17-hydroxyprogesterone and cortisol (Option 1)**: Rules out congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) or Cushing’s. However, gradual symptom onset and lack of severe virilization (e.g., clitoromegaly) make CAH/Cushing’s less likely.  
2. **CA-125 (Option 2)**: Screens for ovarian cancer but irrelevant here; no pelvic mass/atypical symptoms.  
3. **Blood glucose and cholesterol (Option 3)**: Critical for PCOS comorbidities (insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome). Obesity and hyperandrogenism increase diabetes/cardiovascular risk.  
4. **TSH/T4 (Option 4)**: Hypothyroidism can cause menstrual irregularities, but normal vital signs and hyperandrogenism favor PCOS.  
5. **Transvaginal ultrasonography (Option 5)**: Confirms polycystic ovarian morphology but not required for PCOS diagnosis here (already meets 2/3 Rotterdam criteria).  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Blood glucose and cholesterol level measurements / 血糖和胆固醇水平检测)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - PCOS is strongly associated with insulin resistance (50–70% prevalence) and dyslipidemia.  
  - Clinical guidelines (e.g., Endocrine Society) recommend screening for impaired glucose tolerance (oral glucose tolerance test) and lipid abnormalities in PCOS patients, especially with BMI ≥25.  
  - Early detection of metabolic derangements guides interventions (e.g., lifestyle modification, metformin) to reduce long-term cardiovascular/diabetes risks.
