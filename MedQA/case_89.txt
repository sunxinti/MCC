Case_description: 
A 26-year-old G1P0 woman presents to her primary care physician’s office with feelings of anxiety and trouble with sleep. She finds it difficult initiating sleep, occasionally has palpitations, and feels fatigued. She denies having similar symptoms in the past or starting any new medications or illicit drugs. She is currently 10 weeks pregnant and is closely followed by her obstetrician. Her temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 125/70 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 18/min. On physical exam, the patient is mildly diaphoretic. The skin is warm and the thyroid gland is diffusely enlarged with thyroid bruits. Laboratory studies are significant for a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 0.01 µU/mL (normal is 0.5-5.0 µU/mL) and an elevated free thyroxine (FT4) that is inappropriate for her pregnancy. Which of the following is the best treatment option for this patient?
Options: 
1. Methimazole
2. Observation
3. Propylthiouracil
4. Radioiodine therapy
5. Thyroidectomy
Correct Answer: Propylthiouracil

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Basic Information:** A 26-year-old woman, gravida 1 para 0 (G1P0), currently at 10 weeks of gestation.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Feelings of anxiety and trouble with sleep.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:** Difficulty initiating sleep, occasional palpitations, fatigue, mild diaphoresis, warm skin, diffusely enlarged thyroid with thyroid bruits.  
- **Vital Signs:** Temperature 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure 125/70 mmHg, pulse 105/min, respirations 18/min.  
- **Laboratory Findings:** Suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level of 0.01 µU/mL (normal: 0.5-5.0 µU/mL) and elevated free thyroxine (FT4) inappropriate for pregnancy.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Symptoms Timeline:** Acute onset of anxiety, insomnia, palpitations, and fatigue with no previous history, suggesting a new-onset condition.  
- **Physical Exam Findings:** Tachycardia, mild diaphoresis, and a diffusely enlarged thyroid with bruits are indicative of hyperthyroidism, likely Graves' disease due to the presence of thyroid bruits and diffuse goiter.  
- **Laboratory Evidence:** The suppressed TSH and elevated FT4 confirm hyperthyroidism. The inappropriateness of FT4 levels for pregnancy further supports an active hyperthyroid state rather than the normal physiological changes of pregnancy.  
- **Pregnancy Considerations:** Treatment choices must consider fetal safety, especially in the first trimester when teratogenic risks are highest.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Methimazole (Option 1):** Effective antithyroid agent but associated with teratogenic effects (e.g., aplasia cutis) when used in the first trimester. Typically avoided during early pregnancy.  
- **Observation (Option 2):** Not appropriate due to significant hyperthyroid symptoms and potential risks to both mother and fetus if left untreated.  
- **Propylthiouracil (Option 3):** Preferred antithyroid medication in the first trimester due to a lower risk of teratogenic effects compared to Methimazole. Recommended by clinical guidelines for managing hyperthyroidism in early pregnancy.  
- **Radioiodine Therapy (Option 4):** Contraindicated during pregnancy as it can cause fetal thyroid dysfunction and other developmental issues.  
- **Thyroidectomy (Option 5):** Reserved for cases where antithyroid drugs are contraindicated, ineffective, or not tolerated. It is a surgical intervention with inherent risks and typically not first-line.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Propylthiouracil)(丙硫氧嘧啶)**

Qwen is reasoning the answer...

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 3 (Propylthiouracil)

Qwen's full response:

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 26-year-old pregnant woman (G1P0, 10 weeks gestation) presents with anxiety, insomnia, palpitations, and fatigue.  
- Key physical exam findings: Tachycardia (105/min), diaphoresis, warm skin, diffuse thyroid enlargement with bruits.  
- Lab results: Suppressed TSH (0.01 µU/mL) and elevated free T4, inconsistent with normal pregnancy physiology.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Hyperthyroidism Signs**: The combination of low TSH, elevated FT4, tachycardia, palpitations, anxiety, and thyroid bruits strongly points to hyperthyroidism.  
- **Pregnancy Context**: Hyperthyroidism in early pregnancy must be differentiated from normal physiological changes (e.g., elevated hCG can transiently suppress TSH). However, the patient’s symptoms, goiter, bruits, and inappropriately elevated FT4 rule out gestational thyrotoxicosis.  
- **Exclusion of Other Causes**: No recent medication/illicit drug use eliminates amphetamine or thyroid hormone overdose. The absence of past symptoms suggests a new-onset condition, likely Graves’ disease given the thyroid enlargement and bruits.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Methimazole**: Effective for hyperthyroidism but associated with a rare risk of fetal skin defects (e.g., cutis aplasia) in the first trimester. Guidelines recommend avoiding it in early pregnancy.  
- **Option 2: Observation**: Inappropriate due to maternal symptoms (tachycardia, fatigue) and potential risks of untreated hyperthyroidism in pregnancy (e.g., preterm labor, fetal growth restriction).  
- **Option 3: Propylthiouracil (PTU)**: First-line for hyperthyroidism in the first trimester due to lower placental transfer and reduced fetal risk compared to methimazole. It effectively suppresses thyroid hormone synthesis.  
- **Option 4: Radioiodine Therapy**: Contraindicated in pregnancy, as iodine is concentrated in the fetal thyroid, causing permanent hypothyroidism or goiter.  
- **Option 5: Thyroidectomy**: Reserved for severe cases unresponsive to medication or contraindications to drugs. Not first-line due to surgical risks in pregnancy.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Propylthiouracil) (丙硫氧嘧啶)**

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 3 (Propylthiouracil)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 26-year-old G1P0 woman at 10 weeks gestation.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Anxiety, insomnia, palpitations, and fatigue.  
- **Key Findings**:  
  - **Clinical**: Tachycardia (pulse 105/min), mild diaphoresis, warm skin, diffusely enlarged thyroid with bruits.  
  - **Laboratory**: Markedly suppressed TSH (0.01 µU/mL) and elevated FT4 inconsistent with pregnancy.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Hyperthyroidism Signs**: Anxiety, palpitations, insomnia, fatigue, tachycardia, and warm/diaphoretic skin align with thyrotoxicosis.  
- **Thyroid Exam**: Diffuse enlargement with bruits strongly suggests **Graves' disease** (autoimmune hyperthyroidism).  
- **Pregnancy Context**: Elevated FT4 is abnormal in pregnancy (normally, FT4 decreases due to estrogen-induced TBG rise). Suppressed TSH confirms primary hyperthyroidism.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Methimazole**: Effective for hyperthyroidism but **teratogenic in the first trimester** (risk of aplasia cutis, choanal/esophageal atresia). Avoid until after 12 weeks.  
2. **Observation**: Contraindicated. Untreated hyperthyroidism risks maternal (pre-eclampsia, heart failure) and fetal (preterm birth, growth restriction) complications.  
3. **Propylthiouracil (PTU)**: First-line in **first trimester** due to lower teratogenicity vs. methimazole. Preferred despite hepatotoxicity risk.  
4. **Radioiodine Therapy**: Absolute contraindication in pregnancy (crosses placenta, destroys fetal thyroid).  
5. **Thyroidectomy**: Reserved for severe cases unresponsive to medications or with compressive symptoms. Not indicated here.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Propylthiouracil)(丙硫氧嘧啶)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - **First-trimester safety**: PTU is guideline-recommended to avoid methimazole’s teratogenic risks.  
  - **Clinical urgency**: Active Graves’ disease with biochemical hyperthyroidism requires prompt treatment.  
  - **Pregnancy compatibility**: PTU effectively controls maternal thyrotoxicosis while minimizing fetal harm.
