Case_description: 
A 60-year-old female presents to her gynecologist with vaginal bleeding. She underwent menopause ten years prior. She has a past medical history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. On physical examination, her uterus is uniformly enlarged. Ultrasound reveals a thickened endometrial stripe and tissue biopsy reveals neoplastic endometrial cells. A workup for metastatic disease is negative and the gynecologist recommends a laparoscopic hysterectomy. During the procedure, the surgeon ligates multiple vessels in order to remove the entire uterus. In the immediate postoperative period, the patient develops left-sided flank pain and oliguria. Serum creatinine is found to be 1.4 mg/dl whereas it was 1.0 mg/dl prior to the operation. Renal ultrasound is normal. Urinalysis is notable for hematuria. Ligation of which of the following vessels most likely contributed to this patient’s condition?
Options: 
1. Artery of Sampson
2. Ovarian artery
3. Superior vesical artery
4. Uterine artery
5. Inferior vesical artery
Correct Answer: Uterine artery

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** A 60-year-old female, postmenopausal for ten years.
- **Chief Complaint:** Vaginal bleeding.
- **Past Medical History:** Hypertension and diabetes mellitus.
- **Physical Examination:** Uniformly enlarged uterus.
- **Diagnostic Findings:**
  - **Ultrasound:** Thickened endometrial stripe.
  - **Biopsy:** Neoplastic endometrial cells.
  - **Metastatic Workup:** Negative.
- **Intervention:** Laparoscopic hysterectomy with ligation of multiple vessels.
- **Postoperative Complications:**
  - Left-sided flank pain.
  - Oliguria (reduced urine output).
  - Elevated serum creatinine (from 1.0 mg/dl preoperatively to 1.4 mg/dl postoperatively).
  - Renal ultrasound: Normal.
  - Urinalysis: Hematuria.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
The patient presented with postmenopausal vaginal bleeding, raising concern for endometrial cancer, which was supported by imaging and biopsy findings. A laparoscopic hysterectomy was performed, involving ligation of multiple pelvic vessels. Postoperatively, the development of flank pain, oliguria, and hematuria suggests possible renal or ureteral involvement. The absence of hydronephrosis on renal ultrasound makes direct renal injury less likely, pointing towards ureteral injury or compromise. The ureters run in close proximity to several pelvic vessels, making them susceptible to injury during pelvic surgeries.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
Evaluating each vessel option in the context of potential ureteral injury:

1. **Artery of Sampson:** Supplies the perineum and is not in close proximity to the ureters. Unlikely to be involved.
2. **Ovarian Artery:** Runs near the ureter but is typically ligated as part of oophorectomy. Less likely the primary vessel involved in hysterectomy-related ureteral injury.
3. **Superior Vesical Artery:** Supplies the bladder and lower ureter. Injury could affect the ureter but is less commonly ligated during hysterectomy.
4. **Uterine Artery:** Runs in close proximity to the ureter ("water under the bridge" concept). The uterine artery is routinely ligated during hysterectomy, and inadvertent injury or excessive ligation can compromise the ureter's blood supply or cause direct injury.
5. **Inferior Vesical Artery:** Primarily supplies the bladder and is more relevant in male pelvic surgeries. Unlikely to be involved in female hysterectomy.

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 4 (Uterine artery)

Qwen's full response:

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 60-year-old postmenopausal woman presents with vaginal bleeding, leading to a diagnosis of endometrial cancer confirmed by biopsy. She undergoes a laparoscopic hysterectomy, during which multiple vessels are ligated. Postoperatively, she develops left-sided flank pain, oliguria, elevated serum creatinine (1.4 mg/dL from baseline 1.0 mg/dL), and hematuria. Renal ultrasound is normal.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Key Symptoms**: Left flank pain, oliguria, elevated creatinine, and hematuria suggest acute kidney injury (AKI). The left-sided dominance of symptoms implies a unilateral process.  
- **Timeline**: Symptoms emerged immediately post-hysterectomy, pointing to a surgical complication.  
- **Vascular Link**: The AKI is likely due to renal ischemia or obstruction. Since the renal ultrasound is normal, obstruction (e.g., ureteral injury) or renal artery compromise is less likely. Hematuria suggests direct injury to the urinary tract or renal parenchyma.  
- **Anatomical Considerations**: The uterine arteries are ligated during hysterectomy and run close to the ureters. Ureteral injury during this procedure is a known complication, leading to obstruction or inflammation.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **1. Artery of Sampson**: A branch of the ovarian artery supplying the uterine tube. Ligation would primarily affect ovarian/uterine tube perfusion, not the kidney. Unlikely to cause renal symptoms.  
- **2. Ovarian Artery**: Supplies the ovary. Ligation does not directly impact renal perfusion unless there is an anatomical variant (e.g., ovarian artery supplying the kidney), which is rare.  
- **3. Superior Vesical Artery**: Supplies the bladder. Ligation would not cause unilateral renal ischemia.  
- **4. Uterine Artery**: The uterine arteries are routinely ligated during hysterectomy. Their proximity to the ureters raises concern for ureteral injury, which can lead to obstruction (with or without hydronephrosis), inflammation, or hematuria. Even if ultrasound is normal, acute ureteral injury may present with flank pain, hematuria, and prerenal azotemia (elevated creatinine due to decreased renal perfusion from obstruction).  
- **5. Inferior Vesical Artery**: Supplies the bladder base. Ligation does not directly affect renal perfusion.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The patient’s symptoms align most closely with ureteral injury during uterine artery ligation. The uterine arteries run near the ureters, and their ligation can inadvertently cause ureteral kinking, transection, or ischemic damage, leading to obstruction, inflammation, and subsequent AKI. The left-sided symptoms and normal ultrasound suggest an acute process without overt hydronephrosis yet.  

**My final selection is: Option 4 (Uterine artery)(子宫动脉)**

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 4 (Uterine artery)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient:** 60-year-old postmenopausal female with hypertension and diabetes.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Vaginal bleeding (postmenopausal).  
- **Key Findings:**  
  - Uniformly enlarged uterus, thickened endometrial stripe on ultrasound, neoplastic endometrial cells on biopsy (consistent with endometrial cancer).  
  - Post-hysterectomy complications: Left flank pain, oliguria, elevated serum creatinine (1.0 → 1.4 mg/dl), hematuria, normal renal ultrasound.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Postmenopausal Bleeding:** Highly suspicious for endometrial cancer, confirmed by biopsy.  
- **Postoperative Symptoms:** Acute onset of left flank pain, oliguria, and AKI (creatinine rise) with hematuria suggests urinary tract obstruction or ischemia.  
- **Normal Renal Ultrasound:** Rules out hydronephrosis but does not exclude early obstruction or ureteral injury.  
- **Hematuria and Flank Pain:** Indicate trauma or ischemia to the urinary tract, likely ureteral involvement.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Artery of Sampson:** Supplies the round ligament; ligation would not affect the ureter or kidneys. **Unlikely.**  
2. **Ovarian Artery:** Supplies ovaries; ligation during hysterectomy does not directly endanger the ureter. **Unlikely.**  
3. **Superior Vesical Artery:** Supplies the bladder dome; ligation could affect bladder function but not the ureter/kidneys. **Unlikely.**  
4. **Uterine Artery:** Primary blood supply to the uterus. Its close anatomical relationship to the ureter (crosses near the cervix) makes ureteral injury (e.g., ligation, ischemia) a recognized complication of hysterectomy. **Highly Likely.**  
5. **Inferior Vesical Artery:** Supplies the bladder base and distal ureter. Ligation could theoretically cause distal ureteral ischemia, but symptoms (flank pain, oliguria) suggest proximal ureteral/kidney involvement. **Less Likely.**  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Uterine artery)(子宫动脉)**  
- **Key Evidence:**  
  - The uterine artery’s proximity to the ureter (“water under the bridge”) makes ureteral injury (e.g., ligation, ischemia) a well-documented complication of hysterectomy.  
  - Ureteral injury explains left flank pain (ipsilateral obstruction), hematuria (trauma), and AKI (reduced renal output).  
  - Normal renal ultrasound may reflect early obstruction before hydronephrosis becomes apparent.  
- **Exclusion of Alternatives:** Other arteries (Sampson, ovarian, vesical) lack direct anatomical or pathophysiological relevance to the ureter/kidneys in this context.
