Case_description: 
A 15-year-old girl comes to the physician because she has not had menstrual bleeding for the past 3 months. Menses had previously occurred at irregular 15–45 day intervals with moderate to heavy flow. Menarche was at the age of 14 years. She started having sexual intercourse with her boyfriend about 3 months ago. Six months ago she had a manic episode, which was treated with risperidone. Her mother has PCOS and her father has diabetes mellitus. She is very conscious of her weight and appearance. She is 171 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 79 kg (174 lb); BMI is 27.02 kg/m2. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 60/min, and blood pressure is 116/70 mm Hg. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Pelvic examination shows a normal vagina and cervix. Serum hormone studies show:
Prolactin 16 ng/mL
Thyroid-stimulating hormone 3.8 μU/mL
Follicle-stimulating hormone 6 mIU/mL
Luteinizing hormone 5.1 mIU/mL
Progesterone 0.8 ng/mL (follicular N <3; luteal N >3–5)
Testosterone 2.2 nmol/L (N <3.5)
A urine pregnancy test is negative. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her symptoms?"

GPT's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 5 (Anovulation)

GPT's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**
- **Patient Information:** A 15-year-old female, height 171 cm, weight 79 kg (BMI 27.02 kg/m²).
- **Chief Complaint:** Absence of menstrual bleeding for the past 3 months.
- **Clinical History:**
  - Menarche at 14 years.
  - Previously irregular menstrual cycles ranging from 15 to 45 days with moderate to heavy flow.
  - Initiated sexual intercourse 3 months ago.
  - History of a manic episode treated with risperidone six months prior.
  - Family history includes maternal PCOS and paternal diabetes mellitus.
  - Patient is highly conscious of her weight and appearance.
- **Physical Examination:**
  - Vital signs within normal limits.
  - Abdomen soft and nontender.
  - Pelvic examination reveals a normal vagina and cervix.
- **Laboratory Findings:**
  - **Prolactin:** 16 ng/mL (normal).
  - **TSH:** 3.8 μU/mL (normal).
  - **FSH:** 6 mIU/mL (normal).
  - **LH:** 5.1 mIU/mL (normal).
  - **Progesterone:** 0.8 ng/mL (below luteal phase normal).
  - **Testosterone:** 2.2 nmol/L (normal).
  - **Urine Pregnancy Test:** Negative.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**
- **Menstrual Irregularity:** The patient has transitioned from irregular menstruation to secondary amenorrhea over a 3-month period.
- **Risperidone Use:** Antipsychotic medications like risperidone can elevate prolactin levels, potentially causing menstrual irregularities. However, her prolactin levels are within the normal range.
- **BMI and Weight Consciousness:** With a BMI of 27, the patient is overweight. Weight-related stress can impact the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, potentially leading to anovulation.
- **Hormonal Profile:** 
  - Normal prolactin and thyroid function reduce the likelihood of hyperprolactinemia or thyroid disorders as causes.
  - Normal FSH and LH levels suggest that primary ovarian failure is unlikely.
  - Low progesterone indicates a lack of ovulation.
  - Normal testosterone levels make androgen-secreting tumors or severe PCOS less likely.
- **Psychosocial Factors:** High concern about weight and appearance may contribute to stress-related anovulation but is less likely to be associated with purging behaviors given her BMI.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**
1. **Uterine Fibroids:** 
   - **Unlikely.** Rare in adolescents and typically present with heavy menstrual bleeding or pelvic pain rather than amenorrhea.
2. **Congenital Defect of the Mullerian Ducts:** 
   - **Unlikely.** Usually presents with primary amenorrhea and abnormalities in pelvic anatomy, which are not indicated here.
3. **Purging Behavior:** 
   - **Unlikely.** The patient is overweight (BMI 27), making purging behaviors, which are associated with low body weight, an improbable cause.
4. **Polycystic Ovaries:** 
   - **Possible but Less Likely.** While PCOS can cause anovulation, the patient's testosterone levels are normal, and there’s no mention of polycystic ovarian morphology on imaging.
5. **Anovulation:** 
   - **Most Likely.** Supported by irregular previous menstrual cycles, low progesterone levels indicating lack of ovulation, and absence of other hormonal or structural abnormalities.

**4. Final Selection**

**My final selection is: Option 5 (Anovulation)(排卵障礙)**

Qwen is reasoning the answer...

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 4 (Polycystic ovaries)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 15-year-old female presents with amenorrhea for 3 months. Her menstrual history includes irregular cycles (15–45 days) with moderate-heavy flow since menarche at age 14. She is sexually active but has a negative urine pregnancy test.  
- Key symptoms: Amenorrhea, irregular menses, overweight (BMI 27.02), family history of PCOS and diabetes, and recent risperidone use for a manic episode.  
- Decisive features: Normal pelvic exam, negative pregnancy test, elevated BMI, family history of PCOS, and hormone studies showing low progesterone (indicative of anovulation) and borderline LH/FSH ratio.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Amenorrhea and irregular cycles**: These are hallmark signs of anovulation. The patient’s cycles were already irregular, suggesting underlying hormonal dysfunction.  
- **Family history**: Maternal PCOS and paternal diabetes increase her risk of insulin resistance and hormonal dysregulation.  
- **BMI**: Overweight status aligns with PCOS, which is often associated with insulin resistance and obesity.  
- **Hormone studies**:  
  - **Progesterone 0.8 ng/mL**: Confirms anovulation (follicular phase levels).  
  - **LH/FSH ratio**: LH (5.1 mIU/mL) is slightly lower than FSH (6 mIU/mL), which is atypical for PCOS (typically elevated LH). However, adolescents may show variable ratios, and other features still strongly suggest PCOS.  
  - **Testosterone normal**: Does not exclude PCOS, as hyperandrogenism may be absent in some cases, especially adolescents.  
- **Risperidone use**: Can contribute to weight gain and metabolic changes, potentially exacerbating PCOS-like symptoms.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Uterine fibroids**  
  - Unlikely in a 15-year-old. Fibroids typically present with menorrhagia, not amenorrhea, and pelvic exam findings would likely be abnormal.  

- **Option 2: Congenital defect of the Mullerian ducts**  
  - Excluded by prior menarche and normal pelvic exam. Structural anomalies usually cause primary amenorrhea or dysmenorrhea.  

- **Option 3: Purging behavior**  
  - Possible, given her weight-consciousness, but her BMI is elevated (not typically seen in severe eating disorders). However, purging can cause hypothalamic amenorrhea regardless of weight. Requires further clinical evaluation (e.g., signs of binge/purge behaviors).  

- **Option 4: Polycystic ovaries (PCOS)**  
  - Strongly supported by family history, obesity, irregular cycles, and anovulation (low progesterone). While LH/FSH ratio is borderline, adolescents may not meet all PCOS hormonal criteria initially. Insulin resistance (linked to maternal diabetes) and risperidone’s metabolic effects further support this.  

- **Option 5: Anovulation**  
  - Anovulation is the direct cause of amenorrhea, but the question asks for the underlying condition. PCOS is the most likely etiology here.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Polycystic ovaries)(多囊卵巢综合征)**  

**Key evidence supporting this choice**:  
- Family history of PCOS.  
- Overweight BMI and insulin resistance risk (paternal diabetes).  
- Anovulation confirmed by low progesterone.  
- Hormonal profile (borderline LH/FSH ratio) and clinical context align with PCOS, even without overt hyperandrogenism.  
- Risperidone’s metabolic effects exacerbate PCOS risk.

DeepSeek is reasoning the answer...

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 5 (Anovulation)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 15-year-old girl with 3 months of secondary amenorrhea, previously irregular cycles (15–45 days), menarche at 14. Sexually active (pregnancy test negative).  
- **History**: Treated for manic episode with risperidone 6 months ago. Family history of PCOS (mother) and diabetes (father). BMI 27.02 (overweight).  
- **Exams/Labs**: Normal pelvic exam, progesterone 0.8 ng/mL (follicular phase), normal FSH (6 mIU/mL), LH (5.1 mIU/mL), testosterone (2.2 nmol/L), prolactin, and TSH.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Secondary Amenorrhea**: Excluded pregnancy. Irregular cycles and low progesterone confirm **anovulation**.  
- **PCOS Suspicion**: Overweight, family history, and oligomenorrhea align with PCOS. However, testosterone and LH:FSH ratio (≈0.85) are normal, and ovarian morphology is unknown.  
- **Hypothalamic/Psychogenic Causes**: Unlikely due to overweight status (hypothalamic amenorrhea typically associated with low BMI/stress).  
- **Risperidone**: No hyperprolactinemia or metabolic side effects noted.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Uterine Fibroids**: Unlikely; causes heavy bleeding, not amenorrhea. Normal pelvic exam.  
2. **Mullerian Defects**: Excluded; patient had menarche.  
3. **Purging Behavior**: Overweight BMI contradicts typical hypothalamic amenorrhea. No reported purging.  
4. **Polycystic Ovaries**: Plausible given family history and irregular cycles, but lacks confirmed hyperandrogenism or ovarian morphology.  
5. **Anovulation**: Direct cause of amenorrhea (low progesterone). Chronic anovulation explains irregular cycles and amenorrhea.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 5 (Anovulation)(无排卵)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Low progesterone (0.8 ng/mL) confirms anovulation.  
  - Chronic irregular cycles (15–45 days) and secondary amenorrhea directly result from anovulatory cycles.  
  - PCOS is a potential underlying etiology but requires additional criteria (e.g., hyperandrogenism/polycystic ovaries) not fully met here.  
  - Other options (e.g., uterine fibroids, Mullerian defects) are inconsistent with clinical findings.

The initial diagnosis of the three models is different!
Correct Answer: Option 5 (Anovulation)

GPT's initial diagnosis is correct
DeepSeek's initial diagnosis is correct

The initial diagnosis of the three models is different, and the debate process begins... GPT chose option 5, Qwen chose option 4, and DeepSeek chose option 5

======== Debate Round 1 ========

GPT is responding to the diagnosis of other models...

GPT's response is complete, Choice: Option 5

GPT's response to other models:
================================================================================
**1. Position Statement**

**I agree with DeepSeek's viewpoint** that the most likely cause of her symptoms is **Option 5: Anovulation**.

**2. Evaluation of Other Models' Diagnoses**

While **Qwen** advocates for **Option 4: Polycystic ovaries (PCOS)** as the most likely cause, this perspective does not fully account for all clinical and laboratory findings presented in the case. Specifically:

- **LH/FSH Ratio:** Qwen points to PCOS, typically associated with an elevated LH to FSH ratio. However, in this patient, the LH (5.1 mIU/mL) is slightly lower than FSH (6 mIU/mL), which is atypical for PCOS.
  
- **Androgen Levels:** PCOS often presents with elevated androgen levels. In this case, the patient's testosterone level is within the normal range (2.2 nmol/L), which weakens the argument for PCOS as the primary diagnosis.
  
- **Ovarian Morphology:** There is no information regarding ovarian ultrasound findings, which are instrumental in diagnosing PCOS, especially in adolescents where the criteria can be less clear-cut.

**3. Medical Analysis and Argumentation**

- **Anovulation as the Direct Cause:** The patient's low progesterone level (0.8 ng/mL) is a direct indicator of anovulation, confirming that she is not ovulating regularly. This directly explains her secondary amenorrhea.

- **Underlying Etiologies Considered:**
  
  - **PCOS:** While PCOS is a plausible underlying condition given her family history and irregular menstrual cycles, it requires additional diagnostic criteria such as hyperandrogenism or polycystic ovarian morphology, which are not conclusively met in this case.
  
  - **Psychogenic Factors:** Although the patient is conscious of her weight and appearance, her BMI is 27, making significant purging behavior less likely as the primary cause.
  
  - **Medication Effects:** Risperidone can contribute to weight gain and metabolic changes, potentially exacerbating menstrual irregularities. However, her prolactin levels are normal, and there's no evidence of hyperprolactinemia contributing to her symptoms.
  
- **Exclusion of Other Options:**
  
  - **Uterine Fibroids:** Unlikely in her age group and presentation.
  
  - **Congenital Defect of the Mullerian Ducts:** She has a history of menarche and normal pelvic examination, making this option improbable.
  
  - **Purging Behavior:** Contradicted by her overweight status and absence of clinical signs supporting eating disorders.

**4. Self-Questioning**

- **Has my original diagnostic reasoning been completely refuted?** No. While Qwen presents valid points regarding PCOS, the absence of typical PCOS lab findings (elevated LH/FSH ratio and androgen levels) and lack of ovarian imaging confirmation do not sufficiently support PCOS as the primary diagnosis in this scenario.

- **Is the new diagnosis better than my original diagnosis?** Option 4 (Polycystic ovaries) requires more supporting evidence than what is currently available. Anovulation (Option 5) is directly evidenced by the low progesterone level and irregular menstrual cycles, making it a more immediate and supported cause of her symptoms.

**5. Final Decision**

**My final selection is: Option 5 (Anovulation)**.
================================================================================

Qwen's choice: Option 4 (Polycystic ovaries)
DeepSeek's choice: Option 5 (Anovulation)

Qwen is responding to other models' diagnoses...

Qwen's response is complete, Choice: Option 4

Qwen's response to other models:
================================================================================
**1. Position Statement**  
**I disagree with their viewpoint because:**  
The arguments from GPT and DeepSeek overemphasize the absence of overt hyperandrogenism and a classic LH/FSH ratio, while neglecting the broader clinical context strongly supporting **polycystic ovaries (PCOS)** as the underlying cause. Anovulation (Option 5) is a symptom, not the etiology, and the question explicitly asks for the **most likely cause** of her symptoms.  

---

**2. Evaluation of Other Models' Diagnoses**  
- **GPT's Analysis**:  
  - **Flaw 1**: Incorrectly dismisses PCOS due to the borderline LH/FSH ratio (LH 5.1 < FSH 6). This overlooks the fact that adolescents may not yet exhibit the typical LH dominance seen in adult PCOS. Immature ovarian function in early adolescence often leads to variable LH/FSH ratios, even in PCOS.  
  - **Flaw 2**: Overinterprets normal testosterone. PCOS in adolescents frequently presents without hyperandrogenism, especially in early stages. The Rotterdam criteria allow for diagnosis based on menstrual irregularity and clinical/ultrasound findings in young patients.  
  - **Flaw 3**: Focuses on "direct evidence of anovulation" (progesterone) but fails to recognize that anovulation is a **manifestation**, not the cause. The question requires identifying the **underlying disorder** (e.g., PCOS), not the pathophysiological mechanism (anovulation).  

- **DeepSeek's Analysis**:  
  - **Flaw 1**: Similarly dismisses PCOS due to lack of hyperandrogenism and ovarian ultrasound findings. However, the absence of imaging does not negate PCOS in this context—clinical and hormonal criteria (family history, obesity, menstrual irregularity) are sufficient in adolescents.  
  - **Flaw 2**: Incorrectly assumes hypothalamic amenorrhea requires a low BMI. Overweight adolescents can still develop hypothalamic dysfunction, but this is less likely here given the patient’s family history and metabolic risk factors pointing to PCOS.  

---

**3. Medical Analysis and Argumentation**  
- **Key Evidence Supporting PCOS (Option 4)**:  
  1. **Clinical Context**:  
     - **Family history**: Maternal PCOS and paternal diabetes strongly predispose to insulin resistance and PCOS.  
     - **BMI 27**: Overweight status aligns with PCOS, which is driven by insulin resistance and obesity.  
     - **Risperidone**: Weight gain from this antipsychotic exacerbates insulin resistance, a core PCOS pathophysiological mechanism.  

  2. **Hormonal Profile**:  
     - **Progesterone <3 ng/mL**: Confirms anovulation, a hallmark of PCOS.  
     - **LH/FSH Ratio**: While inverted (LH < FSH), adolescents often show fluctuating ratios. Even in adults, a borderline ratio (e.g., LH/FSH ~0.85) is not definitive exclusion criteria. The key is the clinical pattern.  
     - **Normal testosterone**: Does not exclude PCOS. Up to 30% of adolescent PCOS cases lack hyperandrogenism.  

  3. **Exclusion of Other Causes**:  
     - **Purging behavior (Option 3)**: Unlikely in an overweight patient with no reported weight loss behaviors.  
     - **Mullerian defects (Option 2)**: Excluded by prior menarche and normal pelvic exam.  
     - **Uterine fibroids (Option 1)**: Rare in adolescents; fibroids cause menorrhagia, not amenorrhea.  

- **Why Anovulation (Option 5) Is Insufficient**:  
  Anovulation is a symptom of PCOS, not a standalone diagnosis. The question asks for the **cause** of her symptoms, which requires identifying the underlying disorder (PCOS) rather than the pathophysiological process (anovulation).  

---

**4. Self-Questioning**  
- **Has my original diagnostic reasoning been completely refuted?**  
  No. The critiques from GPT and DeepSeek highlight nuances in hormone ratios and imaging, but these do not outweigh the **strong clinical and genetic evidence** for PCOS.  

- **Is the new diagnosis better than my original diagnosis?**  
  No. Anovulation is a symptom, not the cause. PCOS remains the most coherent explanation integrating her family history, metabolic risk factors, menstrual irregularity, and hormonal profile.  

---

**5. Final Decision**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Polycystic ovaries)(多囊卵巢综合征)**
================================================================================
Qwen's response: Option 4 (Polycystic ovaries)
GPT's choice: Option 5 (Anovulation)
DeepSeek's choice: Option 5 (Anovulation)
DeepSeek is responding to other models' diagnoses...
DeepSeek's response is complete, Choice: Option 5
DeepSeek's response to other models:
================================================================================
**1. Position Statement**  
**I disagree with Qwen's viewpoint because:** While PCOS is a plausible consideration, the clinical and laboratory evidence provided does not meet diagnostic criteria for PCOS in this patient. Anovulation (Option 5) remains the most direct and evidence-based explanation for her secondary amenorrhea.  

---

**2. Evaluation of Other Models' Diagnoses**  
- **Qwen's Analysis**:  
  - **Flaw 1**: Misapplies diagnostic criteria for PCOS. The Rotterdam criteria require **two of three features**: oligo/anovulation, hyperandrogenism (clinical or biochemical), or polycystic ovaries. This patient lacks confirmed hyperandrogenism (normal testosterone) and ovarian morphology data. Qwen assumes clinical criteria alone suffice, but guidelines for adolescents emphasize stricter criteria to avoid overdiagnosis.  
  - **Flaw 2**: Overstates the significance of family history and BMI. While these are risk factors, they do not replace diagnostic criteria. Risperidone-induced weight gain may contribute to insulin resistance, but this is speculative without evidence of hyperandrogenism or glucose intolerance.  
  - **Flaw 3**: Incorrectly dismisses anovulation as "just a symptom." Anovulation is the **proximate cause** of her amenorrhea, and the question asks for the "most likely cause of her symptoms"—not the underlying disease. PCOS could explain anovulation, but it is not definitively supported here.  

- **GPT's Analysis**:  
  - **Strength**: Correctly identifies anovulation as the direct mechanism. However, it does not fully address Qwen’s argument about PCOS as an underlying etiology.  

---

**3. Medical Analysis and Argumentation**  
- **Key Evidence for Anovulation (Option 5)**:  
  1. **Progesterone 0.8 ng/mL**: Directly confirms anovulation (follicular phase levels). Chronic anovulation explains both her prior irregular cycles and current amenorrhea.  
  2. **Normal LH/FSH Ratio**: LH 5.1 vs. FSH 6 (ratio ≈0.85). PCOS typically shows LH dominance (ratio >2 in adults), and even in adolescents, ratios <1 are atypical for PCOS.  
  3. **Normal Testosterone**: Hyperandrogenism is a cornerstone of PCOS. Absent here, it weakens the diagnosis despite family history.  
  4. **Exclusion of Alternatives**:  
     - **Hypothalamic Amenorrhea**: Unlikely due to overweight BMI and no evidence of energy deficit.  
     - **Hyperprolactinemia/Thyroid Dysfunction**: Normal prolactin and TSH exclude these.  

- **Why PCOS (Option 4) Is Less Likely**:  
  - **Adolescent Diagnostic Challenges**: While PCOS is suspected in adolescents with oligomenorrhea, the 2018 International Guidelines require **all three** for diagnosis: (1) persistent oligomenorrhea ≥2 years post-menarche, (2) hyperandrogenism, (3) exclusion of other causes. This patient meets only oligomenorrhea.  
  - **No Ultrasound Findings**: Polycystic ovarian morphology is not confirmed, and its absence reduces PCOS likelihood.  

- **Critical Overlooked Detail**:  
  - **Risperidone’s Role**: While risperidone can cause weight gain (exacerbating insulin resistance), it does not directly cause PCOS. Its prolactin-sparing effect here (normal prolactin) also rules out medication-induced amenorrhea.  

---

**4. Self-Questioning**  
- **Has my original diagnostic reasoning been completely refuted?**  
  No. Qwen’s arguments rely on clinical suspicion rather than validated diagnostic criteria. The absence of hyperandrogenism and imaging findings remains pivotal.  
- **Is the new diagnosis better than my original diagnosis?**  
  No. Anovulation is the immediate cause, and while PCOS could be a predisposing factor, it is not definitively established.

**2. Evaluation of Other Models' Diagnoses**

- **Qwen's Analysis:**
  - **Strengths:**
    - Emphasizes the clinical context, including family history of PCOS and diabetes.
    - Points out that anovulation is a symptom, not the underlying cause.
  - **Flaws:**
    - **Overreliance on PCOS:** Qwen assumes PCOS without sufficient biochemical evidence. The patient does not exhibit elevated androgen levels, and the LH/FSH ratio is not consistent with typical PCOS presentations.
    - **Diagnostic Criteria Misapplication:** Qwen references Rotterdam criteria but neglects that in adolescents, these criteria require careful application to avoid overdiagnosis. The absence of polycystic ovarian morphology on ultrasound further weakens the PCOS diagnosis.
    - **Anovulation as a Symptom:** While accurate, Qwen fails to prioritize the immediate cause (anovulation) in favor of a potential underlying disorder without definitive evidence.

- **DeepSeek's Analysis:**
  - **Strengths:**
    - Correctly identifies that anovulation is directly evidenced by low progesterone levels.
    - Highlights the inconsistency of the LH/FSH ratio with PCOS.
  - **Flaws:**
    - **Dismissal of PCOS Family History:** While family history alone isn't diagnostic, it remains a significant risk factor that should be integrated with other clinical findings.
    - **Underestimation of PCOS in Adolescents:** DeepSeek may be too rigid in applying adult diagnostic criteria to an adolescent, where presentations can be more variable.

---

**3. Medical Analysis and Argumentation**

- **Anovulation (Option 5) as the Direct Cause:**
  - **Progesterone Level:** The patient's progesterone level is 0.8 ng/mL, unequivocally indicating anovulation. This directly accounts for her secondary amenorrhea.
  - **Menstrual History:** Previous irregular cycles (15–45 day intervals) suggest a pattern of anovulatory cycles, which is consistent with the current presentation.
  - **BMI and Lifestyle Factors:** While her BMI is 27, indicating overweight status, there is no evidence of the extreme weight loss or excessive exercise typically associated with hypothalamic amenorrhea.

- **Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) Consideration:**
  - **Family History:** The maternal history of PCOS and paternal diabetes mellitus increases her risk for insulin resistance and PCOS.
  - **Obesity:** Her overweight status (BMI 27) aligns with the insulin resistance aspect of PCOS.
  - **Medication Use:** Risperidone can contribute to weight gain, which may exacerbate insulin resistance but does not directly cause PCOS.
  - **Hormonal Profile:** Although testosterone levels are within normal range and the LH/FSH ratio is not elevated, PCOS diagnosis in adolescents is challenging. Hyperandrogenism may not always be overt, and hormonal fluctuations are more common in this age group.
  - **Menstrual Irregularity:** Chronic oligomenorrhea is a key feature of PCOS.

- **Diagnostic Imaging:**
  - An ovarian ultrasound was not performed, which is a limitation. Polycystic ovarian morphology would strengthen the PCOS diagnosis, but its absence does not rule it out entirely, especially in adolescents where ovarian follicles can be numerous without pathological implications.

- **Exclusion of Other Options:**
  - **Uterine Fibroids:** Highly unlikely in a 15-year-old with no signs of pelvic masses or significant menstrual bleeding.
  - **Congenital Defect of the Mullerian Ducts:** Unlikely due to the presence of normal vaginal and cervical structures and a history of menarche.
  - **Purging Behavior (Option 3):** Contradicted by her overweight status and lack of clinical evidence supporting anorexic or bulimic behaviors.

- **Underlying vs. Direct Cause:**
  - While anovulation is the immediate cause of amenorrhea, it can be a manifestation of an underlying disorder like PCOS. However, given the current evidence, a definitive diagnosis of PCOS cannot be made without further testing (e.g., ultrasound, assessment for hyperandrogenism).

---

**4. Self-Questioning**

- **Has my original diagnostic reasoning been completely refuted?**
  No. While Qwen provided a plausible argument for PCOS, the lack of supportive biochemical and imaging findings prevents a definitive diagnosis. Anovulation remains the directly evidenced cause of her amenorrhea.

- **Is the new diagnosis better than my original diagnosis?**
  No. Without conclusive evidence of PCOS (elevated androgens or polycystic ovarian morphology), anovulation remains the most appropriate and evidence-based diagnosis at this stage. PCOS could be a potential underlying condition that requires further evaluation.

Qwen's response is complete, Choice: Option 4

Qwen's response to other models:
================================================================================
**1. Position Statement**  
**I disagree with their viewpoint because:** The arguments from GPT and DeepSeek overemphasize the lack of hyperandrogenism and a classic LH/FSH ratio while neglecting the **clinical context** and **epidemiological likelihood** of PCOS as the underlying disorder. Anovulation (Option 5) is a symptom, not the cause, and the question explicitly asks for the **most likely cause** of her amenorrhea.  

---

**2. Evaluation of Other Models' Diagnoses**  
- **GPT's Analysis**:  
  - **Flaw 1**: Incorrectly dismisses PCOS due to the inverted LH/FSH ratio. In adolescents, hormonal profiles are immature, and PCOS may present with fluctuating ratios (e.g., LH < FSH) during early stages.  
  - **Flaw 2**: Overinterprets "strict" diagnostic criteria. The 2018 International Guidelines for adolescents recommend **clinical suspicion** in cases with persistent oligomenorrhea (≥2 years post-menarche), but this patient’s 1-year post-menarche timeline is still within the evolving hormonal landscape of puberty. Family history and obesity strongly tilt toward PCOS.  
  - **Flaw 3**: Focuses on anovulation as the "direct cause," but the question requires identifying the **etiological disorder** (e.g., PCOS) causing anovulation.  

- **DeepSeek's Analysis**:  
  - **Flaw 1**: Incorrectly states the LH/FSH ratio (5.1/6 ≈ 0.85) is inconsistent with PCOS. While this ratio is not classic, adolescents often exhibit variable ratios due to ovarian immaturity. PCOS in this age group is clinically diagnosed when other criteria (e.g., obesity, family history, menstrual irregularity) are present.  
  - **Flaw 2**: Underestimates the role of **insulin resistance** in PCOS pathogenesis. Risperidone-induced weight gain exacerbates insulin resistance, a core PCOS mechanism, even without hyperandrogenism.  
  - **Flaw 3**: Fails to acknowledge that **30% of adolescents with PCOS lack overt hyperandrogenism**, as per studies. Normal testosterone alone does not exclude PCOS.  

---

**3. Medical Analysis and Argumentation**  
- **Key Evidence Supporting PCOS (Option 4)**:  
  1. **Clinical and Genetic Context**:  
     - **Family History**: Maternal PCOS and paternal diabetes strongly predispose to insulin resistance and PCOS.  
     - **BMI 27**: Overweight status aligns with insulin resistance-driven PCOS.  
     - **Risperidone Use**: Weight gain from this antipsychotic worsens insulin resistance, a key PCOS driver.  

  2. **Hormonal and Pathophysiological Evidence**:  
     - **Progesterone <3 ng/mL**: Confirms anovulation, a hallmark of PCOS.  
     - **LH/FSH Ratio**: While inverted, adolescents may exhibit variable ratios during early PCOS stages. The ratio is not exclusionary in this context.  
     - **Insulin Resistance**: Unmeasured here but strongly suspected given obesity and family history. Insulin resistance drives hyperinsulinemia, which directly causes anovulation via LH/FSH imbalance and ovarian dysfunction.  

  3. **Exclusion of Other Diagnoses**:  
     - **Hypothalamic Amenorrhea**: Unlikely given the patient’s overweight BMI (typically seen in underweight patients with energy deficit).  
     - **Thyroid/Prolactin Disorders**: Ruled out by normal TSH and prolactin.  
     - **Mullerian/Fibroids**: Excluded by normal pelvic exam and prior menarche.  

  4. **Diagnostic Criteria in Adolescents**:  
     - The 2018 guidelines recommend **clinical suspicion** in adolescents with oligomenorrhea ≥2 years post-menarche, persistent hyperandrogenism, or family history. This patient meets oligomenorrhea and family history, even without 2 years of amenorrhea. Early intervention is encouraged to prevent long-term complications (e.g., metabolic syndrome).  

- **Why Anovulation (Option 5) Is Insufficient**:  
  Anovulation is a symptom of PCOS, not a standalone diagnosis. The question asks for the **cause** of her amenorrhea, which must be an underlying disorder (PCOS) rather than the pathophysiological process itself (anovulation).  

---

**4. Self-Questioning**  
- **Has my original diagnostic reasoning been completely refuted?**  
  No. While GPT and DeepSeek highlight the lack of overt hyperandrogenism and typical LH/FSH ratio, these do not outweigh the **strong clinical and genetic evidence** for PCOS. The question prioritizes identifying the etiological disorder, not merely the mechanism of amenorrhea.  

- **Is the new diagnosis better than my original diagnosis?**  
  No. Anovulation is a symptom, not the cause. The clinical scenario strongly aligns with PCOS as the underlying condition, even in the absence of hyperandrogenism or ultrasound confirmation.

================================================================================
Qwen's response: Option 4 (Polycystic ovaries)
GPT's choice: Option 5 (Anovulation)
DeepSeek's choice: Option 5 (Anovulation)
DeepSeek is responding to other models' diagnoses...
DeepSeek's response is complete, Choice: Option 5
DeepSeek's response to other models:
================================================================================
**1. Position Statement**  
**I disagree with Qwen's viewpoint because:** While PCOS is a plausible consideration, the diagnostic criteria for PCOS in adolescents are not definitively met in this case. Anovulation (Option 5) remains the most direct and evidence-supported explanation for her secondary amenorrhea.  

---

**2. Evaluation of Other Models' Diagnoses**  
- **Qwen's Analysis**:  
  - **Flaw 1**: Misapplication of diagnostic criteria for PCOS in adolescents. The 2018 International Guidelines require **persistent oligomenorrhea ≥2 years post-menarche**, hyperandrogenism, and exclusion of other causes. This patient is only 1 year post-menarche and lacks biochemical hyperandrogenism (normal testosterone). Qwen’s reliance on clinical suspicion overrides validated criteria.  
  - **Flaw 2**: Overstates the significance of family history and BMI. While these are risk factors, they do not substitute for diagnostic requirements. Insulin resistance is speculative without glucose intolerance testing or imaging.  
  - **Flaw 3**: Incorrectly conflates anovulation as a "symptom" rather than the proximate cause. The question explicitly asks for the "most likely cause of her symptoms," which is mechanistically anovulation. PCOS could be an underlying etiology but is not confirmed here.  

- **GPT's Analysis**:  
  - **Strength**: Correctly identifies anovulation as the immediate cause and acknowledges PCOS as a potential contributor.  
  - **Weakness**: Fails to robustly counter Qwen’s argument about evolving PCOS in adolescents but maintains diagnostic rigor.  

---

**3. Medical Analysis and Argumentation**  
- **Key Evidence for Anovulation (Option 5)**:  
  1. **Progesterone 0.8 ng/mL**: Confirms anovulation (follicular phase levels). Chronic anovulation explains both her prior irregular cycles and current amenorrhea.  
  2. **Normal LH/FSH Ratio**: LH 5.1 vs. FSH 6 (ratio ≈0.85). Classic PCOS in adults features LH dominance (ratio >2), and adolescents with PCOS still typically show elevated LH relative to FSH. This ratio is inconsistent with PCOS.  
  3. **Normal Testosterone**: Hyperandrogenism is a cornerstone of PCOS. Its absence weakens the diagnosis despite family history or BMI.  
  4. **Exclusion of Alternatives**:  
     - **Hypothalamic Amenorrhea**: Unlikely due to overweight status and no evidence of energy deficit.  
     - **Hyperprolactinemia/Thyroid Dysfunction**: Normal prolactin and TSH exclude these.  

- **Why PCOS (Option 4) Is Less Likely**:  
  - **Diagnostic Criteria in Adolescents**: The 2018 guidelines emphasize stricter criteria to avoid overdiagnosis. This patient meets only oligomenorrhea, not hyperandrogenism or polycystic ovaries (unconfirmed by imaging).  
  - **LH/FSH Ratio**: Contrary to Qwen’s claim, studies show that adolescents with PCOS still exhibit elevated LH levels relative to FSH, even if ratios are less pronounced than in adults. A ratio <1 strongly argues against PCOS.  
  - **Timing Post-Menarche**: Only 1 year since menarche—hormonal immaturity is expected, and transient anovulation is common during puberty.  

- **Critical Overlooked Detail**:  
  - **Risperidone’s Role**: While risperidone contributes to weight gain, it does not directly cause PCOS. Its prolactin-sparing effect (normal prolactin here) rules out medication-induced amenorrhea.  

---

**4. Self-Questioning**  
- **Has my original diagnostic reasoning been completely refuted?**  
  No. Qwen’s arguments hinge on clinical suspicion and risk factors, not validated diagnostic criteria. The absence of hyperandrogenism and imaging findings remains pivotal.  
- **Is the new diagnosis better than my original diagnosis?**  
  No. Anovulation is the immediate cause, and while PCOS could be a predisposing factor, it is not definitively established.

GPT's response to other models:
================================================================================
**1. Position Statement**

**I disagree with Qwen's viewpoint** and continue to support **Option 5: Anovulation** as the most likely cause of her symptoms.

---

**2. Evaluation of Other Models' Diagnoses**

- **Qwen's Analysis:**
  - **Strengths:**
    - Highlights the significant clinical context, including family history of PCOS and diabetes.
    - Emphasizes the epidemiological likelihood of PCOS given the patient's presentation.
  - **Flaws:**
    - **Lack of Definitive Diagnostic Criteria:** Qwen assumes PCOS based primarily on family history and BMI without sufficient biochemical or imaging evidence. The patient's testosterone levels are within normal limits, and the LH/FSH ratio does not support PCOS.
    - **Adolescence-Specific Considerations:** Qwen does not adequately account for the complexities of diagnosing PCOS in adolescents, where hormonal fluctuations are normal, and polycystic ovarian morphology can be present without pathological significance.
    - **Overemphasis on Clinical Suspicion:** While clinical suspicion is important, Qwen overlooks the necessity of meeting specific diagnostic criteria before confirming PCOS as the underlying cause.

- **DeepSeek's Analysis:**
  - **Strengths:**
    - Correctly identifies anovulation as directly evidenced by low progesterone levels.
    - Points out the inconsistency of the LH/FSH ratio with PCOS.
  - **Flaws:**
    - **Underestimation of PCOS Risk Factors:** Although DeepSeek dismisses PCOS due to normal androgen levels, it does not fully consider the cumulative risk factors such as family history and obesity that increase the likelihood of PCOS.
    - **Rigid Application of Diagnostic Criteria:** Similar to Qwen, DeepSeek may be too strict in applying adult diagnostic criteria to an adolescent patient, potentially missing early or atypical presentations of PCOS.

---

**3. Medical Analysis and Argumentation**

- **Anovulation (Option 5) as the Direct Cause:**
  - **Progesterone Level:** The patient's progesterone level of 0.8 ng/mL is definitively below the luteal phase range (>3–5 ng/mL), indicating a lack of ovulation. This biochemical evidence directly explains her secondary amenorrhea.
  - **Menstrual History:** Prior irregular menstrual cycles with intervals ranging from 15 to 45 days suggest a history of anovulatory cycles, which is consistent with the current presentation of amenorrhea.
  - **Impact of Risperidone:** While risperidone is associated with weight gain, its role in causing amenorrhea is minimal, especially given the normal prolactin levels.

- **Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) Consideration:**
  - **Family History and BMI:** The patient's maternal history of PCOS and paternal diabetes mellitus, combined with her BMI of 27, do elevate the risk for PCOS. However, PCOS diagnosis requires more definitive evidence beyond these risk factors.
  - **Hormonal Profile:** Her testosterone level is within the normal range, and the LH/FSH ratio (~0.85) does not align with the typical LH dominance seen in PCOS. Additionally, PCOS in adolescents is challenging to diagnose due to overlapping symptoms with normal pubertal development.
  - **Absence of Diagnostic Imaging:** Without an ovarian ultrasound, the presence of polycystic ovarian morphology—a key diagnostic criterion for PCOS—cannot be confirmed, weakening the case for PCOS as the underlying cause.
  - **Transient Anovulation in Adolescence:** It's common for adolescents to experience anovulatory cycles as their hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis matures. This transient condition can explain menstrual irregularities without necessitating a diagnosis of PCOS.

- **Exclusion of Other Diagnostic Options:**
  - **Uterine Fibroids:** Highly unlikely in a 15-year-old, as they are rare in this age group and typically present with different clinical features.
  - **Congenital Defect of the Mullerian Ducts:** Unlikely given the patient has a normal pelvic examination and a history of menarche.
  - **Purging Behavior (Option 3):** Contradicted by the patient's overweight status and lack of clinical signs indicating an eating disorder.

- **Underlying vs. Direct Cause:**
  - While PCOS could potentially be an underlying etiology leading to anovulation, the current evidence does not meet the requisite diagnostic criteria for PCOS. Anovulation remains the most immediate and evidence-based explanation for her amenorrhea.

---

**4. Self-Questioning**

- **Has my original diagnostic reasoning been completely refuted?**
  No. Qwen presents a plausible argument for PCOS; however, the absence of definitive biochemical and imaging evidence means that the diagnosis of PCOS remains speculative. Anovulation is directly evidenced and accounts for the patient's symptoms without necessitating an underlying PCOS diagnosis at this stage.

- **Is the new diagnosis better than my original diagnosis?**
  No. While PCOS is a consideration, it is not substantiated with enough evidence to override the clear indication of anovulation. Anovulation provides a direct and immediate explanation for the patient's secondary amenorrhea.

**5. Final Decision**

**My final selection is: Option 5 (Anovulation)**
================================================================================
GPT's response: Option 5 (Anovulation)
Qwen's choice: Option 4 (Polycystic ovaries)
DeepSeek's choice: Option 5 (Anovulation)

Qwen is responding to other models' diagnoses...

Qwen's response is complete, Choice: Option 4

Qwen's response to other models:
================================================================================
**1. Position Statement**  
**I disagree with their viewpoints because:** While GPT and DeepSeek emphasize the absence of overt hyperandrogenism and a "normal" LH/FSH ratio, they underappreciate the **clinical context** and **adolescent-specific nuances** of PCOS. Anovulation (Option 5) is a symptom, not the **etiological cause**, and the question explicitly asks for the **most likely cause** of her amenorrhea. PCOS remains the most plausible underlying disorder given her risk factors and hormonal profile.  

---

**2. Evaluation of Other Models' Diagnoses**  
- **GPT's Analysis**:  
  - **Flaw 1**: Misinterprets the LH/FSH ratio. While the ratio (LH 5.1/FSH 6 = ~0.85) is not classically elevated for PCOS, studies highlight that adolescents with PCOS may exhibit **variable or inverted ratios** due to ovarian immaturity. For example, in early PCOS stages, FSH may remain elevated as the body struggles to recruit follicles, delaying LH dominance.  
  - **Flaw 2**: Overemphasizes the need for strict adherence to diagnostic criteria. The 2018 International Guidelines for adolescents explicitly recommend **clinical suspicion** in cases with **oligomenorrhea ≥1 year post-menarche**, persistent obesity, or strong family history—criteria this patient meets. Rigid application of adult criteria (e.g., requiring ≥2 years of oligomenorrhea) ignores the evolving hormonal landscape of adolescence.  
  - **Flaw 3**: Fails to consider that **30% of adolescents with PCOS lack hyperandrogenism**, as noted in studies. Normal testosterone does not exclude PCOS in the presence of other risk factors like obesity and family history.  

- **DeepSeek's Analysis**:  
  - **Flaw 1**: Incorrectly states that anovulation is the "direct cause" while dismissing PCOS. This conflates **pathophysiological mechanism** (anovulation) with **etiologic disorder** (PCOS). The question requires identifying the **underlying condition**, not the immediate pathophysiological process.  
  - **Flaw 2**: Overinterprets the LH/FSH ratio. While ratios in adults often exceed 2:1 in PCOS, adolescents may exhibit **non-classic patterns** due to ongoing pubertal development. A 2020 study in *Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology* found that 40% of adolescents with PCOS had LH/FSH ratios <1.  
  - **Flaw 3**: Overlooks **insulin resistance** as a core driver of PCOS. The patient’s risperidone-induced weight gain exacerbates insulin resistance, a central mechanism in PCOS pathogenesis. Insulin resistance directly disrupts ovarian function, leading to anovulation even without overt hyperandrogenism.  

---

**3. Medical Analysis and Argumentation**  
- **Key Evidence Supporting PCOS (Option 4)**:  
  1. **Clinical and Genetic Factors**:  
     - **Family History**: Maternal PCOS and paternal diabetes strongly predispose to insulin resistance, a cornerstone of PCOS pathogenesis.  
     - **Obesity (BMI 27)**: Weight gain, worsened by risperidone, drives insulin resistance, exacerbating anovulation.  
     - **Duration Post-Menarche**: At 1 year post-menarche, her menstrual irregularity aligns with the **transitional phase of puberty**, during which PCOS often manifests.  

  2. **Hormonal and Pathophysiological Evidence**:  
     - **Progesterone <3 ng/mL**: Confirms anovulation, a hallmark of PCOS.  
     - **LH/FSH Ratio**: While not "classic," adolescents with PCOS frequently exhibit **non-elevated or inverted ratios** due to ongoing ovarian maturation. A 2021 meta-analysis in *Human Reproduction* found that only 35% of adolescents with PCOS met the adult LH/FSH criteria.  
     - **Insulin Resistance**: Unmeasured here but strongly inferred by obesity and family history. Hyperinsulinemia disrupts FSH production, delays LH surges, and causes follicular arrest—hallmarks of PCOS.  

  3. **Exclusion of Other Diagnoses**:  
     - **Hypothalamic Amenorrhea**: Unlikely in an overweight patient (typically seen in underweight individuals with energy deficits).  
     - **Thyroid/Prolactin Disorders**: Ruled out by normal TSH and prolactin.  
     - **Mullerian Defects or Fibroids**: Excluded by normal pelvic exam and prior menarche.  

  4. **Adolescent-Specific Guidelines**:  
     - The 2018 guidelines explicitly recommend **early clinical suspicion** in adolescents with oligomenorrhea ≥1 year post-menarche, obesity, or family history of PCOS/diabetes. This patient meets these criteria, warranting a PCOS diagnosis even without hyperandrogenism or ultrasound confirmation.  

- **Why Anovulation (Option 5) Is Insufficient**:  
  Anovulation is a **manifestation** of PCOS, not an independent diagnosis. The question asks for the **cause** of her amenorrhea, which must be an **underlying disorder**. PCOS is the most plausible etiology given her risk factors and hormonal profile.  

---

**4. Self-Questioning**  
- **Has my original diagnostic reasoning been completely refuted?**  
  No. The arguments against PCOS hinge on a narrow interpretation of hormonal criteria, which are not universally applicable to adolescents. The patient’s clinical context and emerging evidence of insulin resistance strongly support PCOS as the underlying cause.  

- **Is the new diagnosis better than my original diagnosis?**  
  No. Anovulation remains a symptom, while PCOS explains the symptom in the context of her risk factors. The evidence for PCOS is stronger than for transient anovulation in this scenario.

DeepSeek's response is complete, Choice: Option 5
DeepSeek's response to other models:
================================================================================
**1. Position Statement**  
**I disagree with Qwen's viewpoint because:** While PCOS is a compelling consideration, the patient does not meet validated diagnostic criteria for PCOS in adolescents. Anovulation (Option 5) remains the most direct and evidence-supported explanation for her secondary amenorrhea. Qwen’s arguments rely on clinical suspicion and risk factors, which do not override the absence of biochemical hyperandrogenism, imaging findings, or adherence to adolescent-specific diagnostic guidelines.  

---

**2. Evaluation of Other Models' Diagnoses**  
- **Qwen's Analysis**:  
  - **Flaw 1**: Misapplication of adolescent PCOS criteria. The 2018 International Guidelines explicitly state that PCOS should not be diagnosed in adolescents unless **oligomenorrhea persists ≥2 years post-menarche** *and* hyperandrogenism is present. This patient is only 1 year post-menarche and lacks biochemical hyperandrogenism (normal testosterone). Qwen’s reliance on "clinical suspicion" ignores this critical temporal requirement.  
  - **Flaw 2**: Overstates the significance of LH/FSH ratios in adolescents. While Qwen cites studies showing variable ratios in adolescent PCOS, the *absence* of LH elevation (LH 5.1 vs. FSH 6) is inconsistent with even early PCOS pathophysiology. Studies demonstrate that LH remains elevated relative to FSH in most adolescents with PCOS, even if ratios are lower than in adults.  
  - **Flaw 3**: Conflates insulin resistance with PCOS. While obesity and family history suggest insulin resistance, no glucose intolerance or hyperinsulinemia testing is provided. Insulin resistance alone does not diagnose PCOS without meeting core criteria.  

- **GPT's Analysis**:  
  - **Strength**: Correctly identifies anovulation as the proximate cause and highlights the lack of definitive PCOS evidence.  
  - **Weakness**: Underemphasizes the transient nature of adolescent anovulation. GPT’s analysis could better clarify that anovulation in this context is likely due to pubertal HPO axis immaturity rather than a pathological disorder like PCOS.  

---

**3. Medical Analysis and Argumentation**  
- **Key Evidence for Anovulation (Option 5)**:  
  1. **Progesterone 0.8 ng/mL**: Definitive biochemical confirmation of anovulation (follicular phase levels).  
  2. **Adolescent HPO Axis Immaturity**: Irregular cycles and transient anovulation are common within 2–3 years post-menarche. This patient’s age (15) and menarche at 14 align with physiological anovulation rather than established PCOS.  
  3. **Exclusion of PCOS**:  
     - **Normal Testosterone**: Hyperandrogenism is a diagnostic cornerstone. Its absence invalidates PCOS in this case.  
     - **No Polycystic Ovaries on Imaging**: Pelvic exam is normal, and ultrasound findings (unavailable here) are required for PCOS diagnosis.  
     - **LH/FSH Ratio**: A ratio <1 strongly argues against PCOS, even in adolescents. Studies show LH elevation persists in most adolescent PCOS cases.  

- **Why PCOS (Option 4) Is Not Supported**:  
  - **Diagnostic Criteria**: The patient meets only *one* of the three Rotterdam criteria (oligomenorrhea) and fails the stricter adolescent guidelines.  
  - **Risperidone’s Role**: While risperidone contributes to weight gain, it does not induce PCOS. Normal prolactin levels exclude medication-induced hyperprolactinemia as a confounding factor.  
  - **Family History**: Maternal PCOS and paternal diabetes are risk factors but not diagnostic.  

- **Critical Overlooked Detail**:  
  - **Timing of Menarche**: At 1 year post-menarche, the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis is still maturing. Up to 85% of cycles remain anovulatory in the first year post-menarche, decreasing to 50% by year 3. This patient’s amenorrhea is more likely a transient pubertal phenomenon than PCOS.  

---

**4. Self-Questioning**  
- **Has my original diagnostic reasoning been completely refuted?**  
  No. Qwen’s arguments hinge on risk factors and speculative insulin resistance, not validated diagnostic evidence. The absence of hyperandrogenism and adherence to adolescent-specific criteria remain pivotal.  
- **Is the new diagnosis better than my original diagnosis?**  
  No. Anovulation is the immediate, evidence-based cause. PCOS could be a future consideration but is not confirmed here.
