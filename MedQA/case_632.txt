Case_description: 
A 41-year-old woman presents with shortness of breath that is worse when she lies on her left side. About 10 days ago, she had an episode of unexplained loss of consciousness. Past medical history is negative and family history is irrelevant. Clinical examination shows a diastolic murmur, which is prominent when she lies on her left side. Jugular venous distention is present, and chest examination reveals fine crackles that do not clear with coughing. Chest X-ray shows pulmonary congestion, and 2-dimensional echocardiogram shows a mass in the left atrium attached to the atrial septum. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options: 
1. Rheumatic fever
2. Innocent murmur
3. Subacute infective endocarditis
4. Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis
5. Atrial myxoma
Correct Answer: Atrial myxoma

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** 41-year-old woman with no significant past medical or family history.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Shortness of breath (dyspnea) worsening when lying on her left side.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - An episode of unexplained loss of consciousness 10 days prior.  
  - Diastolic murmur, more prominent when lying on the left side.  
  - Jugular venous distention (JVD).  
  - Fine crackles in the lungs not clearing with coughing.  
  - Chest X-ray showing pulmonary congestion.  
  - Echocardiogram revealing a mass in the left atrium attached to the atrial septum.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Dyspnea:** Worsening when lying on the left side may suggest a positional component related to cardiac filling or obstruction.  
- **Diastolic Murmur:** Indicates possible valvular dysfunction, commonly associated with mitral or aortic insufficiency. Its prominence when lying on the left side may relate to increased venous return or positional changes affecting the heart.  
- **Jugular Venous Distention:** Suggests elevated right atrial pressure, possibly due to heart failure or obstruction in cardiac filling.  
- **Fine Crackles:** Indicative of pulmonary congestion, supporting a diagnosis of heart failure or obstructive cardiac pathology.  
- **Echocardiogram Findings:** A mass in the left atrium attached to the atrial septum is highly suggestive of a specific cardiac tumor.  
- **History of Syncope:** May result from an embolic event or obstruction of blood flow within the heart.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**

1. **Rheumatic Fever:**  
   - **Likelihood:** Low. Rheumatic fever typically presents with migratory arthritis, carditis, polyarthritis, and history of preceding streptococcal infection. The presence of a cardiac mass is not characteristic.  
   - **Alignment:** Does not align well with the echocardiographic finding of a left atrial mass.

2. **Innocent Murmur:**  
   - **Likelihood:** Low. Innocent murmurs are typically benign, without associated structural heart disease, and do not present with other significant symptoms like a cardiac mass or pulmonary congestion.  
   - **Alignment:** The presence of a mass and other systemic symptoms oppose this diagnosis.

3. **Subacute Infective Endocarditis:**  
   - **Likelihood:** Moderate. It can present with murmurs due to valvular involvement and systemic symptoms. However, endocarditis typically affects valves rather than presenting as a mass attached to the atrial septum.  
   - **Alignment:** The echocardiographic finding is more suggestive of a tumor than vegetations seen in endocarditis.

4. **Non-bacterial Thrombotic Endocarditis:**  
   - **Likelihood:** Low. This condition is usually associated with hypercoagulable states and often occurs in the context of malignancies. It presents with sterile vegetations on valves, not a mass in the atrium.  
   - **Alignment:** Does not explain the presence of a large intracardiac mass.

5. **Atrial Myxoma:**  
   - **Likelihood:** High. Atrial myxomas are the most common primary cardiac tumors, typically located in the left atrium attached to the interatrial septum. They can cause symptoms of obstruction (dyspnea, positional changes in symptoms), embolic events (which could explain syncope), and constitutional symptoms.  
   - **Alignment:** The echocardiogram findings, combined with the clinical presentation, strongly support this diagnosis.

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 5 (Atrial myxoma)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 41-year-old woman presents with dyspnea worsened when lying on her left side and a recent episode of unexplained syncope.  
- Key clinical findings: Diastolic murmur prominent in left lateral decubitus position, jugular venous distention, non-cough-sensitive fine crackles, pulmonary congestion on chest X-ray, and a left atrial mass attached to the atrial septum on echocardiogram.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Positional dyspnea and murmur**: The worsening of dyspnea and prominence of the diastolic murmur when lying on the left side suggest mechanical obstruction (e.g., a left atrial mass displacing toward the mitral valve during this position).  
- **Syncope**: Likely due to transient obstruction of blood flow by the mass during certain body positions or cardiac cycles, leading to reduced cardiac output.  
- **Pulmonary congestion and JVD**: Reflect chronic or acute left-sided heart failure, possibly secondary to obstruction of left atrial outflow (e.g., mitral valve obstruction by a mass).  
- **Echocardiogram findings**: A left atrial mass attached to the septum is highly specific for a cardiac tumor, such as an atrial myxoma, rather than vegetations or thrombi.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **1. Rheumatic fever**: Unlikely due to the patient’s age, absence of classic rheumatic manifestations (e.g., arthritis, chorea, valvular regurgitation), and the presence of a discrete mass.  
- **2. Innocent murmur**: Excluded by the presence of a diastolic murmur (pathological), associated symptoms (syncope, dyspnea), and echocardiographic findings.  
- **3. Subacute infective endocarditis**: Requires evidence of infection (e.g., fever, positive blood cultures) and vegetations on valves, not in the left atrium. No such findings are present.  
- **4. Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis**: Characterized by small, sterile vegetations on valves, typically in critically ill patients (e.g., malignancy, uremia). The mass in the left atrium and its attachment to the septum are inconsistent with this diagnosis.  
- **5. Atrial myxoma**: The most consistent diagnosis. Atrial myxomas are the most common primary cardiac tumors, typically arising from the left atrium near the fossa ovalis. They cause obstructive symptoms (e.g., dyspnea, syncope) due to intermittent obstruction of mitral valve flow, especially in certain body positions. The echocardiogram findings of a mobile mass and positional murmur are pathognomonic.

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 41-year-old woman.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Shortness of breath (worse in left lateral decubitus position) and recent syncope (10 days prior).  
- **Key Findings**:  
  - **Diastolic murmur** accentuated in the left lateral position.  
  - **Jugular venous distention** (JVD) and **fine crackles** (non-clearing with coughing).  
  - **Chest X-ray**: Pulmonary congestion.  
  - **Echocardiogram**: Left atrial mass attached to the atrial septum.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Positional Dyspnea and Murmur**: Suggests a **mobile intracardiac mass** (e.g., atrial myxoma) that intermittently obstructs mitral valve flow in specific positions.  
- **Syncope**: Likely due to transient obstruction of cardiac output by the mass.  
- **JVD and Pulmonary Congestion**: Indicate **left atrial pressure overload** (mass obstructing mitral inflow) leading to pulmonary edema.  
- **Echocardiogram**: Definitive evidence of a left atrial mass attached to the septum, a hallmark of atrial myxoma.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Rheumatic Fever**: Unlikely. Rheumatic mitral stenosis causes a diastolic murmur, but it lacks positional variability and does not explain the left atrial mass.  
2. **Innocent Murmur**: Excluded. Innocent murmurs are systolic, asymptomatic, and unrelated to structural abnormalities.  
3. **Subacute Infective Endocarditis (SBE)**: Unlikely. SBE causes valvular vegetations (not septal masses) and typically presents with fever, embolic phenomena, and systemic signs of infection (absent here).  
4. **Non-bacterial Thrombotic Endocarditis (NBTE)**: Unlikely. NBTE involves small, sterile vegetations on valves (not atrial septal masses) and is associated with malignancies or hypercoagulable states (no evidence here).  
5. **Atrial Myxoma**: **Most consistent**. Left atrial myxomas classically present with positional symptoms, diastolic murmurs, syncope (from obstruction), and pulmonary congestion. Echocardiographic findings confirm the diagnosis.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 5 (Atrial myxoma)(心房粘液瘤)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Positional dyspnea and murmur due to mobile left atrial mass.  
  - Syncope from intermittent mitral valve obstruction.  
  - Echocardiogram showing a septal-based left atrial mass (pathognomonic for myxoma).  
  - Absence of features supporting alternative diagnoses (e.g., fever, valvular vegetations, or systemic illness).
