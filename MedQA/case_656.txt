Case_description: 
A 55-year-old man is brought to the emergency room by his wife for severe abdominal pain for the past 1 hour. He is unable to give more information about the nature of his pain. His wife says that he has peptic ulcer disease and is being treated with antacids without a good response. She adds that he vomited repeatedly  in the last couple of hours, his vomitus being brown/red in color. His temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), respiratory rate is 16/min, pulse is 97/min, and blood pressure is 100/68 mm Hg. A physical exam reveals a tense abdomen with a board like rigidity and positive rebound tenderness. An erect abdominal x-ray is ordered. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options: 
1. Duodenal peptic ulcer
2. Gastric peptic ulcer
3. Pancreatitis
4. Perforated gastric peptic ulcer
5. Choledocholithiasis
Correct Answer: Perforated gastric peptic ulcer

GPT's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**
- **Patient Information:** A 55-year-old man with a history of peptic ulcer disease.
- **Chief Complaint:** Severe abdominal pain lasting for the past 1 hour.
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**
  - Vomiting repeatedly with brown/red colored vomitus.
  - Vital signs: Slightly low blood pressure (100/68 mm Hg), pulse of 97/min, normal temperature and respiratory rate.
  - Physical Exam: Tense abdomen with board-like rigidity and positive rebound tenderness.
  
**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**
- **Timeline:** Acute onset of severe abdominal pain over 1 hour, accompanied by several hours of vomiting.
- **Pain Characteristics:** Sudden and severe, suggesting an acute abdominal catastrophe.
- **Vomitus Color:** Brown/red indicates possible upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be associated with peptic ulcer disease.
- **Physical Signs:** Board-like rigidity and positive rebound tenderness are indicative of peritonitis, suggesting irritation of the peritoneum possibly due to perforation.
- **Vital Signs:** Slight hypotension and tachycardia may indicate hypovolemia, possibly from bleeding.
- **Imaging:** An erect abdominal x-ray is appropriate to identify free air under the diaphragm, which is a classic sign of gastrointestinal perforation.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**
1. **Duodenal Peptic Ulcer:**
   - Typically presents with epigastric pain relieved by food.
   - Can lead to complications like bleeding or perforation.
   - However, without signs of perforation, it's less likely the immediate diagnosis.
   
2. **Gastric Peptic Ulcer:**
   - Presents with epigastric pain that may worsen with eating.
   - Can also lead to bleeding or perforation.
   - Similar to duodenal ulcers in potential complications.
   
3. **Pancreatitis:**
   - Characterized by acute epigastric pain radiating to the back.
   - Accompanied by elevated pancreatic enzymes.
   - Less likely to present with peritonitis unless there is severe necrosis or complications, which is not indicated here.
   
4. **Perforated Gastric Peptic Ulcer:**
   - Presents with sudden, severe abdominal pain and signs of peritonitis.
   - Vomiting with blood suggests possible bleeding, and perforation would allow gastric contents to irritate the peritoneum.
   - Erect abdominal x-ray may show free air under the diaphragm, supporting this diagnosis.
   
5. **Choledocholithiasis:**
   - Presents with right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, and possibly pancreatitis if the stone obstructs the common bile duct.
   - Does not typically present with generalized peritonitis.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Perforated gastric peptic ulcer)(穿孔的胃性消化性溃疡)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 4 (Perforated gastric peptic ulcer)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 55-year-old man presents with sudden severe abdominal pain, inability to describe pain characteristics, and brown/red vomitus (suggesting blood).  
- Key symptoms:  
  - History of peptic ulcer disease unresponsive to antacids.  
  - Vomiting with hematemesis (brown/red vomitus).  
  - Physical exam reveals **board-like abdominal rigidity**, **positive rebound tenderness** (peritoneal signs), and normal vital signs (except borderline low systolic BP at 100 mmHg).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Sudden onset of severe pain** in a patient with chronic peptic ulcer disease raises concern for perforation.  
- **Peritoneal signs** (rigidity, rebound tenderness) indicate **peritonitis**, commonly caused by gastrointestinal perforation.  
- **Hematemesis** suggests active upper GI bleeding, which may be secondary to the ulcer itself or a complication of perforation.  
- The timeline (1 hour of severe pain, recent vomiting) aligns with acute perforation.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **1. Duodenal peptic ulcer**: Likely if pain is epigastric and unexplained by peritoneal signs. However, perforation must be ruled out.  
- **2. Gastric peptic ulcer**: Similar to duodenal ulcers but less common. Perforation would present identically to duodenal perforation.  
- **3. Pancreatitis**: Typically presents with epigastric pain radiating to the back, elevated lipase, and less likely to cause **board-like rigidity** without necrosis.  
- **4. Perforated gastric peptic ulcer**: **Most consistent with the findings**. Perforation explains peritonitis, acute pain, and hematemesis. The history of PUD and failed antacid therapy supports this.  
- **5. Choledocholithiasis**: Unlikely, as gallstones rarely cause peritoneal signs unless complicated by perforation or pancreatitis.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Perforated gastric peptic ulcer)(穿孔性胃性消化性溃疡)**  

**Key evidence**:  
- **Peritoneal signs** (board-like rigidity, rebound tenderness) are hallmark of gastrointestinal perforation.  
- History of **peptic ulcer disease** with poor response to antacids increases perforation risk.  
- **Hematemesis** may result from ulcer bleeding, and perforation explains the acute abdomen presentation.  
- An erect abdominal X-ray (as ordered) would confirm free air under the diaphragm, solidifying the diagnosis.

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 4 (Perforated gastric peptic ulcer)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 55-year-old man with peptic ulcer disease, poor response to antacids.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Sudden severe abdominal pain (1-hour duration) and recurrent brown/red vomitus.  
- **Key Clinical Features**:  
  - **Acute Abdomen Signs**: Tense abdomen, board-like rigidity, rebound tenderness (indicative of peritonitis).  
  - **Vital Signs**: Tachycardia (pulse 97/min), borderline hypotension (BP 100/68 mmHg).  
  - **Vomitus**: Brown/red color (suggestive of hematemesis, possibly from upper GI bleeding or gastric content leakage).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline**: Sudden-onset severe pain and vomiting align with an acute abdominal catastrophe.  
- **Board-like Rigidity and Rebound Tenderness**: Pathognomonic for peritoneal irritation, often caused by hollow viscus perforation (e.g., gastric/duodenal ulcer perforation).  
- **Vomitus**: Brown/red material likely represents altered blood (coffee-ground vomitus) or gastric contents mixed with blood, consistent with ulcer complications.  
- **Hypotension and Tachycardia**: Suggest systemic inflammation or early shock secondary to perforation or hemorrhage.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Duodenal Peptic Ulcer (Option 1)**: Common in peptic ulcer disease but typically causes epigastric pain relieved by food. Perforation is possible, but duodenal perforation often presents with free air on imaging. However, gastric perforation is more strongly associated with hematemesis.  
2. **Gastric Peptic Ulcer (Option 2)**: Similar to duodenal ulcers but more likely to bleed. Uncomplicated ulcers do not explain peritoneal signs; rigidity and rebound tenderness suggest perforation.  
3. **Pancreatitis (Option 3)**: Epigastric pain radiating to the back, elevated amylase/lipase, and systemic inflammation. However, board-like rigidity is rare unless severe necrosis/hemorrhage occurs. Vomitus is typically bilious, not brown/red.  
4. **Perforated Gastric Peptic Ulcer (Option 4)**: Best explains the acute peritonitis (rigidity, rebound tenderness), hematemesis, and hypotension. Perforation leads to gastric content leakage into the peritoneum, causing chemical peritonitis. Erect abdominal X-ray may show subdiaphragmatic free air.  
5. **Choledocholithiasis (Option 5)**: Presents with biliary colic, jaundice, and elevated liver enzymes. Severe peritonitis is atypical unless complicated by cholangitis or gallbladder perforation.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Perforated gastric peptic ulcer)(胃穿孔性消化性溃疡)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  1. **Acute Peritonitis**: Board-like rigidity and rebound tenderness indicate peritoneal irritation, most consistent with hollow organ perforation.  
  2. **History of Refractory Peptic Ulcer**: Poor response to antacids suggests ulcer progression.  
  3. **Hematemesis**: Brown/red vomitus aligns with gastric ulcer bleeding or perforation.  
  4. **Expected Imaging Findings**: Erect abdominal X-ray likely reveals pneumoperitoneum (free air under the diaphragm), confirming perforation.
