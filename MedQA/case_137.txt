Case_description: 
A 36-year-old woman comes to the clinic because of tearing and a foreign body sensation in her eyes bilaterally, which has gradually worsened over the last several weeks. She also notes having occasional palpitations, nervousness, sweating, and heat intolerance. Her past medical history is unremarkable. She reports a 20-pack-year smoking history and is currently a daily smoker. Physical examination shows an anxious, trembling woman. She has eyelid retraction bilaterally, with an inability to fully close her eyes. Her extraocular motility is limited on upgaze. There is no thyromegaly, and no thyroid nodules are noted. Laboratory studies reveal a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 0.1 μU/mL and total T4 of 42 μg/dL. Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin is positive. CT scan of the orbits shows proptosis and marked enlargement of the extraocular muscle with sparing of the tendons. Which of the following would most likely transiently worsen this patient’s eye symptoms?
Options: 
1. External orbital radiation
2. Selenium supplementation
3. Smoking cessation
4. Systemic corticosteroids
5. Treatment with radioactive iodine
Correct Answer: Treatment with radioactive iodine

================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**
- **Patient Information**: 36-year-old woman with a 20-pack-year smoking history, currently a daily smoker.
- **Chief Complaint**: Bilateral tearing and foreign body sensation in the eyes, progressively worsening over several weeks.
- **Additional Symptoms**: Occasional palpitations, nervousness, sweating, and heat intolerance.
- **Physical Examination**:
  - Anxious and trembling demeanor.
  - Bilateral eyelid retraction with inability to fully close the eyes.
  - Limited extraocular motility on upgaze.
  - No evidence of thyromegaly or thyroid nodules.
- **Laboratory Findings**:
  - Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level: 0.1 μU/mL (low).
  - Total T4: 42 μg/dL (elevated).
  - Positive thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin.
- **Imaging**: CT scan reveals proptosis and marked enlargement of the extraocular muscles with sparing of the tendons.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**
The patient presents with symptoms indicative of hyperthyroidism, as evidenced by low TSH and elevated T4 levels, along with positive thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin, which is highly suggestive of Graves' disease. The ocular manifestations, including proptosis, eyelid retraction, and restrictive myopathy of the extraocular muscles (with tendon sparing), are characteristic of Graves' ophthalmopathy. The presence of a significant smoking history further supports the diagnosis, as smoking is a well-known risk factor for the development and exacerbation of Graves' ophthalmopathy. The gradual worsening of eye symptoms over weeks aligns with the inflammatory nature of the orbital tissues in this condition.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**
Evaluating each diagnostic option in the context of Graves' ophthalmopathy:

1. **External orbital radiation**: Used as a treatment modality for Graves' ophthalmopathy to reduce inflammation. It may alleviate symptoms rather than worsen them.
2. **Selenium supplementation**: Has been shown to have beneficial effects in mild Graves' ophthalmopathy by reducing oxidative stress.
3. **Smoking cessation**: Strongly recommended as smoking exacerbates Graves' ophthalmopathy. Stopping smoking is associated with improvement in eye symptoms over time.
4. **Systemic corticosteroids**: Serve as a primary treatment to reduce inflammation and immune activity in Graves' ophthalmopathy, thereby improving symptoms.
5. **Treatment with radioactive iodine**: This is known to potentially exacerbate Graves' ophthalmopathy. Radioactive iodine can increase the autoimmune response, leading to a transient worsening of eye symptoms.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 5 (Treatment with radioactive iodine)(用放射性碘治疗)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 5 (Treatment with radioactive iodine)

Qwen's full response:

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 36-year-old woman presents with bilateral eye tearing, foreign body sensation, and progressive worsening over weeks. She also has symptoms of hyperthyroidism (palpitations, sweating, heat intolerance, nervousness).  
- Key clinical findings: Bilateral eyelid retraction, inability to fully close eyes, limited upgaze, and normal thyroid examination. Laboratory results show suppressed TSH (0.1 μU/mL), elevated total T4 (42 μg/dL), and positive thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI). CT scan reveals proptosis and enlarged extraocular muscles with spared tendons.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- The combination of thyroid dysfunction (hyperthyroidism) and ocular manifestations (eyelid retraction, proptosis, extraocular muscle enlargement) strongly suggests **Graves’ orbitopathy (thyroid eye disease [TED])**.  
- The timeline (weeks of progression) aligns with chronic inflammatory changes in TED. The sparing of muscle tendons on imaging supports active TED, as tendons are typically preserved in early/mild cases.  
- Positive TSI antibodies confirm Graves’ disease as the underlying cause. Smoking history (a known TED risk factor) likely exacerbates disease severity.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (External orbital radiation):** A standard treatment for moderate-to-severe TED to reduce orbital inflammation. It would not worsen symptoms transiently but improve them.  
- **Option 2 (Selenium supplementation):** May reduce TED severity in mild cases by modulating inflammation. It would not transiently worsen symptoms.  
- **Option 3 (Smoking cessation):** Smoking cessation is recommended to slow TED progression. While symptoms may improve over time, abrupt cessation does not cause transient worsening.  
- **Option 4 (Systemic corticosteroids):** First-line therapy for active TED to suppress inflammation. Initial administration may transiently increase inflammation (steroid paradox), but this is rare. The overall effect is symptom improvement.  
- **Option 5 (Radioactive iodine [RAI]):** RAI treats hyperthyroidism by ablating thyroid tissue. However, in Graves’ disease patients with active TED, RAI can transiently worsen eye symptoms due to inflammation triggered by thyroid destruction and release of stored TSI antibodies. This is a well-documented risk, especially in smokers.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 5 (Treatment with radioactive iodine)(放射性碘治疗)**  

**Key evidence supporting this choice:**  
- Radioactive iodine (RAI) is contraindicated in active TED because it can exacerbate ocular inflammation. The patient’s active disease (proptosis, muscle enlargement, eyelid retraction) and smoking history further increase this risk. RAI-induced thyroid cell necrosis releases stored TSI antibodies, worsening inflammation. This transient worsening is a recognized complication in TED patients undergoing RAI.

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 36-year-old woman with a 20-pack-year smoking history.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Bilateral tearing, foreign body sensation in the eyes (weeks of progression), palpitations, nervousness, sweating, and heat intolerance.  
- **Key Findings**:  
  - Eyelid retraction, incomplete eye closure, limited upgaze.  
  - Lab: TSH ↓ (0.1 μU/mL), total T4 ↑ (42 μg/dL), thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (+).  
  - Orbital CT: Proptosis, enlarged extraocular muscles with tendon sparing.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Hyperthyroidism**: Low TSH, elevated T4, and symptoms (palpitations, heat intolerance) confirm thyrotoxicosis. Positive thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) supports Graves' disease.  
- **Thyroid Eye Disease (TED)**: Eyelid retraction, proptosis, and CT findings (muscle enlargement with tendon sparing) are pathognomonic for Graves' ophthalmopathy.  
- **Smoking**: A major risk factor for TED progression.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **External orbital radiation**: Reduces inflammation/edema in TED; improves symptoms. **Unlikely to worsen**.  
2. **Selenium supplementation**: May improve mild TED; no transient worsening.  
3. **Smoking cessation**: Long-term benefit for TED; no transient exacerbation.  
4. **Systemic corticosteroids**: First-line for active TED; reduces inflammation. **Improves symptoms**.  
5. **Radioactive iodine (RAI)**: Known to transiently worsen TED via increased autoimmune activity. RAI releases thyroid antigens, exacerbating orbital inflammation, especially without concurrent steroids.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 5 (Treatment with radioactive iodine) (放射性碘治疗)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - RAI therapy for Graves’ hyperthyroidism is associated with transient worsening of TED due to autoimmune flare.  
  - Guidelines recommend avoiding RAI in active TED unless combined with corticosteroids.  
  - Patient’s smoking history and active TED make RAI a high-risk choice for exacerbation.
