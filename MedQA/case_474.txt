Case_id: case_474
Case_description: 
A patient is unresponsive in the emergency department following a motor vehicle accident. The patient's written advance directive states that he does not wish to be resuscitated in the event of a cardiac arrest. The patient's wife arrives and demands that "everything" be done to keep him alive because she "can't go on living without him." The patient's adult son is on his way to the hospital. If the patient arrests, which of the following should occur?
Options: 
1. Respect the wife's wishes and resuscitate the patient
2. Respect the patient's prior wishes and do not resuscitate
3. Allow the patient's adult son to make the final decision on whether or not to resuscitate
4. Consult a judge for the final decision on whether or not to resuscitate
5. Consult the hospital ethics committee
Correct Answer: Respect the patient's prior wishes and do not resuscitate

GPT is reasoning the answer...

GPT's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 2 (Respect the patient's prior wishes and do not resuscitate)

GPT's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** An individual involved in a motor vehicle accident, currently unresponsive in the emergency department.
- **Advance Directive:** The patient has a written advance directive explicitly stating a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order in the event of cardiac arrest.
- **Family Interaction:** The patient's wife arrives and insists on full resuscitative efforts to keep the patient alive, expressing that she "can't go on living without him." The patient's adult son is expected to arrive shortly.
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:** The patient is unresponsive post-accident, a situation that could potentially lead to cardiac arrest requiring immediate decision-making regarding resuscitation.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Advance Directive Validity:** The patient is an adult who has clearly articulated his wishes regarding resuscitation in a legally recognized advance directive. This document is intended to guide healthcare providers when the patient is incapacitated.
- **Family Wishes:** While the wife expresses a strong desire to pursue all possible measures to sustain the patient's life, her request conflicts with the patient's documented wishes. Emotional distress of family members is understandable but does not override legal directives.
- **Arrival of Adult Son:** The son, being an adult, may have the legal authority to act as a surrogate decision-maker. However, unless he arrives before critical decisions need to be made, the advance directive remains the primary guiding document.
- **Timing and Urgency:** In the event of imminent cardiac arrest, there may be limited time to consult additional family members or committees, necessitating adherence to pre-established directives.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Respect the wife's wishes and resuscitate the patient**  
  - **Assessment:** This option prioritizes family wishes over the patient's autonomy. It contradicts the legal and ethical obligation to honor advance directives.
  
- **Option 2: Respect the patient's prior wishes and do not resuscitate**  
  - **Assessment:** This aligns with respecting patient autonomy and adhering to legally binding advance directives. Clinical guidelines support honoring DNR orders unless legally contested.
  
- **Option 3: Allow the patient's adult son to make the final decision on whether or not to resuscitate**  
  - **Assessment:** Unless the son has legal standing as a designated healthcare proxy, the advance directive takes precedence. This option may cause unnecessary delays in critical situations.
  
- **Option 4: Consult a judge for the final decision on whether or not to resuscitate**  
  - **Assessment:** Judicial intervention is generally reserved for unresolved disputes without clear directives. This would cause delays incompatible with the urgency of a cardiac arrest situation.
  
- **Option 5: Consult the hospital ethics committee**  
  - **Assessment:** While ethics committees provide valuable guidance, the existence of a clear advance directive renders this unnecessary in urgent scenarios requiring immediate action.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Respect the patient's prior wishes and do not resuscitate) 尊重患者先前的意愿，不进行复苏**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 2 (Respect the patient's prior wishes and do not resuscitate)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A patient is unresponsive following a motor vehicle accident.  
- The patient has a written advance directive refusing resuscitation in the event of cardiac arrest.  
- The patient’s wife demands aggressive life-sustaining measures, while the adult son is en route.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Advance Directive**: The patient’s explicit prior wishes are documented in a written advance directive, which is a legally binding document outlining medical preferences when the patient cannot self-advocate.  
- **Family Conflict**: The wife’s demand to "do everything" conflicts with the patient’s own wishes. However, family members (including spouses) cannot override a valid advance directive unless they are designated as the patient’s healthcare proxy, which is not stated here.  
- **Legal and Ethical Framework**: Resuscitation decisions must prioritize the patient’s autonomy. Advance directives are designed to ensure respect for the patient’s wishes, even in emotionally charged situations.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (Respect the wife’s wishes)**: Incorrect. The wife’s wishes do not override the patient’s valid advance directive. Family members cannot override an explicit refusal of resuscitation unless they are legally appointed as the patient’s proxy, which is not indicated here.  
- **Option 2 (Respect the patient’s prior wishes)**: Correct. The advance directive is the patient’s legally recognized expression of autonomy. Healthcare providers are obligated to honor it, even if family members object.  
- **Option 3 (Let the son decide)**: Incorrect. The son’s decision-making authority is secondary to the patient’s advance directive unless he is the designated healthcare proxy (not stated).  
- **Option 4 (Consult a judge)**: Unnecessary. Advance directives are typically clear and legally enforceable without judicial intervention unless there is ambiguity or evidence of coercion/fraud, which is not mentioned here.  
- **Option 5 (Consult the ethics committee)**: While ethical dilemmas may arise, the case hinges on established legal and ethical principles (respecting advance directives). An ethics consultation is not required here, as the directive’s validity is straightforward.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Respect the patient's prior wishes and do not resuscitate)(尊重患者的先前意愿，不进行复苏)**

DeepSeek is reasoning the answer...

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 2 (Respect the patient's prior wishes and do not resuscitate)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: Unresponsive following a motor vehicle accident.  
- **Advance Directive**: Explicitly states refusal of resuscitation in case of cardiac arrest.  
- **Family Dynamics**: Wife demands full resuscitation; adult son en route.  
- **Key Issue**: Conflict between the patient’s prior written wishes and family’s current demands.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Advance Directive**: Legally valid document reflecting the patient’s autonomous decision when competent.  
- **Wife’s Demand**: Emotional plea but contradicts the patient’s documented wishes.  
- **Ethical/Legal Priority**: Patient autonomy (via advance directive) supersedes surrogate decision-makers unless the directive is invalid or ambiguous.  
- **Timing**: Cardiac arrest requires immediate action; no time for prolonged deliberation or legal processes.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Option 1 (Respect wife’s wishes)**: Contravenes patient autonomy and legal/ethical obligations to honor advance directives. Unjustified unless directive is invalid.  
2. **Option 2 (Respect patient’s wishes)**: Aligns with legal standards (e.g., U.S. Patient Self-Determination Act) and medical ethics (autonomy). Strongest support.  
3. **Option 3 (Son’s decision)**: Irrelevant if advance directive is valid; surrogates cannot override a clear prior directive.  
4. **Option 4 (Consult judge)**: Impractical in emergencies; courts typically uphold valid advance directives.  
5. **Option 5 (Ethics committee)**: Useful for mediating conflicts but may delay urgent decisions. Not definitive in emergencies.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Respect the patient's prior wishes and do not resuscitate)(尊重患者预先意愿，不进行复苏)**  
- **Key Evidence**: The advance directive is legally binding and ethically paramount. Medical ethics prioritize patient autonomy over surrogate demands unless the directive is invalid. Emergency settings require adherence to pre-established patient wishes to avoid ethical/legal violations.
