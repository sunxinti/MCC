GPT's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** A 15-year-old male high school freshman, captain of the wrestling team, performing adequately academically.  
- **Chief Complaint:** His mother is concerned because she has caught him masturbating multiple times over the past month.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:** The patient appears embarrassed during the visit and avoids eye contact. Physical examination reveals no abnormalities.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Age and Development:** At 15 years old, the patient is in mid-adolescence, a period characterized by sexual development and exploration.  
- **Behavior:** Masturbation is a common and normal behavior during adolescence as individuals explore their sexuality.  
- **Duration and Frequency:** The behavior has been occurring over the past month. There is no indication of compulsivity or distress beyond embarrassment in clinical settings.  
- **Psychosocial Factors:** The patient is active in sports and performing well academically, suggesting a well-adjusted individual without evident psychosocial stressors.  
- **Clinical Examination:** The absence of physical abnormalities rules out any physiological issues related to sexual development or dysfunction. His embarrassment and avoidance of eye contact may be typical adolescent behavior concerning sexual matters rather than indicative of a deeper psychological issue.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Advise the patient to stop masturbating**  
  - **Assessment:** This approach pathologizes a normal sexual behavior and may lead to unnecessary shame or guilt.  
  - **Conclusion:** Not appropriate without evidence of distress or dysfunction.

- **Option 2: Measure serum testosterone level**  
  - **Assessment:** There are no clinical signs of androgen deficiency or excess.  
  - **Conclusion:** Unnecessary in the absence of physical symptoms.

- **Option 3: Refer the patient for behavioral therapy**  
  - **Assessment:** Behavioral therapy is indicated for maladaptive behaviors or psychological issues, which are not evidenced in this case.  
  - **Conclusion:** Not warranted based on current presentation.

- **Option 4: Reassure the mother**  
  - **Assessment:** Educating the mother about the normalcy of adolescent sexual behavior can alleviate her concerns.  
  - **Conclusion:** Aligns with clinical guidelines for managing normal sexual development in adolescents.

- **Option 5: Prescribe sertraline**  
  - **Assessment:** Sertraline is an SSRI used for depression or anxiety, which are not indicated in this case.  
  - **Conclusion:** Inappropriate without signs of mood or anxiety disorders.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Reassure the mother)(安慰母亲)**

Qwen is reasoning the answer...

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 4 (Reassure the mother)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 15-year-old male presents with his mother's concern about frequent masturbation over the past month. He is a healthy 9th grader, captain of the wrestling team, and performs well academically. Physical examination is unremarkable, and he appears embarrassed but has no physical or psychological abnormalities.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Key Features**: The patient is in early puberty, and masturbation is a common and normal behavior during this developmental stage. The mother’s concern stems from societal or cultural misconceptions about masturbation, not from observable pathology.  
- **Timeline and Characteristics**: The behavior has been ongoing for a month without reported negative consequences (e.g., academic decline, social withdrawal, or physical symptoms). The patient’s normal physical exam and healthy lifestyle (athletic involvement, good grades) suggest no underlying medical or psychological issues.  
- **Support/Opposition to Diagnoses**: There is no evidence of compulsive behavior, hormonal imbalance, or psychiatric disorder. The patient’s embarrassment likely reflects social discomfort rather than a clinical issue.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (Advise to stop masturbating)**: Inappropriate. Masturbation is a normal physiological behavior in adolescents and does not require intervention unless it causes physical harm or interferes with daily life, which is not the case here.  
- **Option 2 (Measure serum testosterone)**: Unnecessary. There is no clinical indication for hormonal testing (e.g., signs of precocious puberty, virilization, or endocrine disorder).  
- **Option 3 (Refer for behavioral therapy)**: Unwarranted. Behavioral therapy is indicated for compulsive or addictive behaviors interfering with function, which is not evident here.  
- **Option 4 (Reassure the mother)**: Most appropriate. The mother’s concern likely arises from misinformation about masturbation. Education about its normality in adolescents and reassurance about the absence of pathology align with clinical guidelines.  
- **Option 5 (Prescribe sertraline)**: Inappropriate. Antidepressants are not indicated without evidence of depression, anxiety, or compulsive disorders.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Reassure the mother)(安抚母亲)**

DeepSeek is reasoning the answer...

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 4 (Reassure the mother)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient:** 15-year-old boy, 9th-grade student, wrestling team captain, academically stable.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Mother’s concern about frequent masturbation observed over the past month.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:** No physical abnormalities on examination; patient exhibits embarrassment and avoids eye contact.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Behavioral Context:** Masturbation is developmentally normal in adolescents and typically peaks during puberty. The mother’s concern likely stems from cultural or personal discomfort rather than pathological behavior.  
- **Psychosocial Factors:** The patient’s embarrassment reflects normal adolescent self-consciousness, exacerbated by privacy intrusion. His functional status (academic and athletic performance) suggests no significant impairment.  
- **Physical Examination:** Normal findings rule out organic causes (e.g., hormonal imbalances, anatomical abnormalities).  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Advise to stop masturbating:** Contraindicated. Masturbation is a normative behavior; discouraging it may induce shame or guilt without addressing the mother’s anxiety.  
2. **Measure testosterone:** Unnecessary. No clinical signs of hypogonadism (e.g., delayed puberty, poor muscle mass). Normal physical exam and athletic performance argue against hormonal pathology.  
3. **Refer for behavioral therapy:** Unwarranted. No evidence of compulsive behavior, distress, or functional impairment. The behavior aligns with typical adolescent development.  
4. **Reassure the mother:** **Most appropriate.** Education about normal sexual development, addressing parental concerns, and encouraging privacy/communication resolves the issue.  
5. **Prescribe sertraline:** Inappropriate. No psychiatric symptoms (e.g., OCD, depression) to justify SSRI use.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Reassure the mother)(向母亲保证情况正常)**  
- **Key Evidence:** Masturbation is a normative adolescent behavior with no pathological features. The patient’s embarrassment and intact functioning support reassurance and parental education as the gold standard. Clinical guidelines emphasize normalizing this behavior unless associated with harm or dysfunction.
