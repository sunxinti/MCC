GPT's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** A 9-year-old male.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Routine check-up three months following a throat infection.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - Painless subcutaneous nodules located on the back of the wrists, the outer elbows, and the front of the knees.  
  - Inflammation in the joints of the lower extremities.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline:** The patient presents three months post a throat infection, suggesting a possible post-infectious sequelae.  
- **Subcutaneous Nodules:** These are firm, painless lumps typically found over bony prominences and are characteristic of certain rheumatologic conditions.  
- **Joint Inflammation:** The involvement of large joints, especially in the lower extremities, is indicative of migratory polyarthritis, a major criterion in certain inflammatory diseases.  
- **Interrelationship of Symptoms:** The combination of subcutaneous nodules and migratory polyarthritis, especially following a streptococcal infection, strongly suggests an autoimmune or post-infectious rheumatologic condition.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Renal failure**  
  - **Likelihood:** Low. While post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis can follow a throat infection, it typically presents with hematuria, hypertension, and edema rather than subcutaneous nodules and joint inflammation.
  
- **Option 2: Hepatomegaly**  
  - **Likelihood:** Low. Hepatomegaly is not a common feature associated with the presented symptoms or with post-streptococcal sequelae like rheumatic fever.
  
- **Option 3: Chorea**  
  - **Likelihood:** High. Sydenham's chorea is a major Jones criterion for rheumatic fever, presenting as involuntary, purposeless movements. Given the patient's symptoms of subcutaneous nodules and joint inflammation post-throat infection, chorea is a pertinent associated symptom.
  
- **Option 4: Pleural effusion**  
  - **Likelihood:** Low. Pleural effusion is not typically associated with rheumatic fever or the described symptoms.
  
- **Option 5: Butterfly rash**  
  - **Likelihood:** Low. A butterfly rash is characteristic of systemic lupus erythematosus, which does not align with the current clinical presentation focused on post-infectious arthritis and subcutaneous nodules.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Chorea)(舞蹈病)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 3 (Chorea)

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 9-year-old male presents three months after a throat infection with painless subcutaneous nodules on the back of the wrist, outer elbow, and front of the knees, along with inflammation in the joints of the lower extremities.  
- Key symptoms: Subcutaneous nodules (painless, over bony prominences), polyarthritis (lower extremity joints), and a history of recent streptococcal infection.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Subcutaneous nodules**: These are painless, firm, and typically located over bony prominences (e.g., elbows, knees, wrists). They are a hallmark of rheumatic fever and represent immune complex deposition.  
- **Polyarthritis**: Inflammation of joints in the lower extremities (e.g., knees) is a major criterion for rheumatic fever, often asymmetric and migratory.  
- **Timeline**: The three-month delay after a throat infection aligns with the typical 2–6-week window for post-streptococcal immune-mediated diseases like rheumatic fever.  
- **Exclusion of other causes**: The absence of systemic symptoms (e.g., rash, fever) and the specific locations of nodules and arthritis argue against conditions like lupus or septic arthritis.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **1. Renal failure**: Unlikely. Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis typically presents within 1–3 weeks of infection with hematuria, edema, and hypertension, not subcutaneous nodules or arthritis.  
- **2. Hepatomegaly**: Not a classic feature of rheumatic fever. Could occur in other conditions (e.g., cardiac failure from rheumatic carditis), but no cardiac symptoms are mentioned.  
- **3. Chorea**: A major criterion for rheumatic fever (Sydenham’s chorea). It often develops 4–6 months after the initial infection, closely aligning with the patient’s timeline. Chorea is characterized by involuntary, purposeless movements and is common in pediatric rheumatic fever.  
- **4. Pleural effusion**: Could occur secondary to rheumatic carditis (e.g., heart failure), but the case does not mention cardiac symptoms or signs (e.g., dyspnea, murmurs).  
- **5. Butterfly rash**: Classic for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), unrelated to post-streptococcal infection.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Chorea)(舞蹈病)**  

**Key evidence**:  
- Subcutaneous nodules and polyarthritis are major criteria for rheumatic fever.  
- The three-month post-infection timeline aligns with the delayed onset of chorea (Sydenham’s chorea) in rheumatic fever.  
- Chorea is a well-documented major diagnostic criterion for rheumatic fever, making it the most likely additional symptom in this case.

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 3 (Chorea)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient:** 9-year-old male, 3 months post-throat infection.  
- **Key Symptoms:**  
  1. **Painless subcutaneous nodules** on extensor surfaces (wrist, elbow, knees).  
  2. **Lower extremity joint inflammation** (arthritis).  
- **Decisive Features:** Subcutaneous nodules and migratory arthritis following streptococcal infection, suggestive of **rheumatic fever**.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline:** Symptoms developed 3 months after a throat infection, consistent with **post-streptococcal sequelae** (e.g., rheumatic fever).  
- **Nodules:** Painless, localized to extensor surfaces—classic for **rheumatic nodules**, a major Jones criterion.  
- **Arthritis:** Migratory, affecting large joints (lower extremities), another major Jones criterion.  
- **Opposing Features:** Absence of acute symptoms (e.g., fever, carditis) does not exclude rheumatic fever, as manifestations can be delayed or isolated.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Renal failure (Option 1):** Unlikely. Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) causes renal involvement but presents earlier (1–2 weeks post-infection) with hematuria/edema, not nodules/arthritis.  
2. **Hepatomegaly (Option 2):** Rare in rheumatic fever. More typical of metabolic disorders or heart failure (not described here).  
3. **Chorea (Option 3):** Highly likely. **Sydenham chorea** is a neurological manifestation of rheumatic fever, often delayed (1–6 months post-infection).  
4. **Pleural effusion (Option 4):** Uncommon in rheumatic fever. Suggests SLE or tuberculosis, but no supporting features (e.g., rash, fever).  
5. **Butterfly rash (Option 5):** Pathognomonic for SLE, not rheumatic fever.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Chorea)(舞蹈症)**  
- **Key Evidence:**  
  1. Subcutaneous nodules and arthritis align with rheumatic fever (Jones criteria).  
  2. Chorea is a delayed, specific neurological manifestation of rheumatic fever.  
  3. Timeline (3 months post-infection) matches Sydenham chorea’s typical onset.
