**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**
- **Patient Information**: A 52-year-old male with a history of Crohn disease.
- **Chief Complaint**: 1-week history of dysuria (painful urination) and urinary urgency.
- **Clinical History**:
  - Treated for urinary tract infections twice in the past 6 months.
  - Currently on infliximab therapy (a TNF-α inhibitor used to manage Crohn disease).
- **Diagnostic Findings**:
  - **Cystoscopy**: Revealed pearl-like plaques on the bladder wall.
  - **Biopsy**: Showed a focal layer of stratified squamous epithelium with hyperkeratosis.
- **Decisive Features**:
  - **Cystoscopic and Histological Findings**: Suggestive of squamous metaplasia of the bladder, which can be associated with chronic irritation or deficiency states.
  - **Underlying Condition**: Crohn disease, which may lead to malabsorption and subsequent vitamin deficiencies.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**
- **Timeline and Characteristics**:
  - Acute onset (1 week) of lower urinary tract symptoms.
  - Chronic history of urinary issues, possibly indicating recurrent infections or underlying bladder pathology.
- **Interrelationships**:
  - Crohn disease can lead to malabsorption syndromes, increasing the risk of specific vitamin deficiencies.
  - Infliximab therapy may suppress the immune system, potentially increasing susceptibility to infections or complicating existing conditions.
- **Supporting Evidence for Vitamin Deficiency**:
  - Hyperkeratosis observed in the bladder biopsy indicates abnormal keratinization, which can be linked to specific vitamin deficiencies affecting epithelial integrity.
  - The presence of stratified squamous epithelium suggests metaplastic changes possibly due to a deficiency disrupting normal urothelial differentiation.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**
Evaluating each diagnostic option in the context of potential vitamin deficiencies associated with Crohn disease and the presented bladder findings:

1. **Carpopedal Spasm**:
   - **Associated Vitamin Deficiency**: Vitamin D deficiency.
   - **Relevance**: Vitamin D deficiency leads to hypocalcemia, causing neuromuscular excitability and carpopedal spasms.
   - **Alignment**: Possible in Crohn disease due to malabsorption but less directly related to bladder epithelial changes.

2. **Perifollicular Hemorrhage**:
   - **Associated Vitamin Deficiency**: Vitamin C deficiency (scurvy).
   - **Relevance**: Causes fragile blood vessels leading to perifollicular hemorrhages.
   - **Alignment**: Not directly related to bladder epithelial hyperkeratosis.

3. **Photodermatitis**:
   - **Associated Vitamin Deficiency**: Niacin deficiency (pellagra).
   - **Relevance**: Causes dermatitis, often in sun-exposed areas, diarrhea, and dementia.
   - **Alignment**: Not closely linked to bladder changes.

4. **Night Blindness**:
   - **Associated Vitamin Deficiency**: Vitamin A deficiency.
   - **Relevance**: Leads to ocular symptoms like night blindness and can cause epithelial hyperkeratosis due to impaired epithelial differentiation.
   - **Alignment**: Vitamin A deficiency can affect epithelial tissues, potentially explaining the bladder findings.

5. **Intracranial Hypertension**:
   - **Associated Vitamin Deficiency**: Less commonly associated; more often linked to vitamin A toxicity rather than deficiency.
   - **Relevance**: Presents with headache and visual disturbances.
   - **Alignment**: Not directly related to bladder epithelial changes.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Night blindness) 夜盲**

Qwen is reasoning the answer...

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 4 (Night blindness)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 52-year-old man with Crohn disease presents with 1-week dysuria and urinary urgency.  
- History of two urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 6 months. Currently on infliximab (anti-TNF-α therapy).  
- Cystoscopy reveals **pearl-like plaques** on the bladder wall.  
- Biopsy shows **focal stratified squamous epithelium with hyperkeratosis**, suggesting squamous metaplasia.  
- The question links these findings to a **vitamin deficiency**.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Crohn disease and infliximab use**: Crohn disease is associated with malabsorption, increasing risk of vitamin deficiencies. Infliximab (anti-TNF-α) may exacerbate vitamin deficiencies indirectly by altering gut flora or absorption.  
- **Pearl-like plaques and squamous metaplasia with hyperkeratosis**: These are hallmark findings of **squamotrichoblastic (plaque) lesions** in the bladder, often seen in chronic inflammation, UTIs, or vitamin A deficiency.  
- **Vitamin A deficiency**: Key features include epithelial abnormalities (e.g., squamous metaplasia, hyperkeratosis), night blindness, dry eyes (xerophthalmia), and skin changes.  
- **UTIs as a trigger**: Recurrent UTIs may contribute to bladder mucosal irritation, but the biopsy findings point to an underlying metabolic or nutritional deficiency.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Carpopedal spasm** (Calcium/Vitamin D deficiency): Unrelated to bladder squamous metaplasia. Carpopedal spasm occurs in hypocalcemia (e.g., vitamin D deficiency), which affects bone metabolism and neuromuscular function, not epithelial keratinization.  
- **Option 2: Perifollicular hemorrhage** (Vitamin C deficiency/scurvy): Scurvy causes collagen defects, leading to perifollicular hemorrhages and poor wound healing. Not linked to bladder squamous metaplasia.  
- **Option 3: Photodermatitis** (Riboflavin/Niacin deficiency): Photodermatitis is associated with riboflavin deficiency, causing skin sensitivity to light, or niacin deficiency (pellagra), which causes dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia. No direct link to bladder epithelial changes.  
- **Option 4: Night blindness** (Vitamin A deficiency): Vitamin A is critical for epithelial integrity and vision. Squamous metaplasia/hyperkeratosis in the bladder and night blindness are both caused by vitamin A deficiency. This aligns with the case’s presentation.  
- **Option 5: Intracranial hypertension** (Vitamin A toxicity): Excessive vitamin A intake can cause pseudotumor cerebri, but the case describes deficiency, not excess. Thus, this is irrelevant.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Night blindness)(夜盲症)**  

**Key evidence**:  
- Squamous metaplasia with hyperkeratosis in the bladder is a known manifestation of vitamin A deficiency, which also causes **night blindness** due to impaired rhodopsin synthesis in the retina.  
- The patient’s Crohn disease and malabsorption history support a deficiency etiology.  
- No other options align with the bladder biopsy findings and vitamin deficiency mechanism.
