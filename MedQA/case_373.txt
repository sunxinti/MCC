GPT's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**
- **Patient Information:** A 45-year-old male contact lens wearer with a history of bronchial asthma treated with inhaled salbutamol. He works as a kindergarten teacher.
- **Chief Complaint:** Progressive pain and blurry vision in the right eye for 1 day.
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**
  - Difficulty opening the right eye due to pain (suggestive of photophobia).
  - Visual acuity significantly reduced in the right eye (counting fingers at 3 feet) compared to the left eye (20/25).
  - Acute onset of symptoms.
  - No systemic symptoms (normal temperature).
  
**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**
- **Acute Onset:** The rapid progression over one day suggests an aggressive pathological process.
- **Severe Ocular Pain and Blurry Vision:** Indicates possible corneal involvement or elevated intraocular pressure.
- **Contact Lens Use:** Increases the risk for microbial keratitis, especially with improper lens hygiene.
- **Visual Acuity Deterioration:** Significant reduction points towards corneal opacification or ulceration.
- **Absence of Systemic Symptoms:** Less likely to be related to systemic infections or inflammatory conditions.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**
1. **Angle-Closure Glaucoma:**
   - **Likelihood:** Low. Typically presents with sudden severe eye pain, headache, nausea, and vomiting. May show a mid-dilated non-reactive pupil and elevated intraocular pressure.
   - **Relation to Case:** Contact lens use is not a risk factor; absence of systemic symptoms like nausea diminishes likelihood.
   
2. **Epidemic Keratoconjunctivitis:**
   - **Likelihood:** Low to Moderate. Usually viral, caused by adenoviruses, and presents with conjunctival hyperemia, watery discharge, and may have subepithelial infiltrates.
   - **Relation to Case:** Rapid onset aligns, but severe vision loss and pain are less characteristic.
   
3. **Herpes Simplex Keratitis:**
   - **Likelihood:** Moderate. Presents with dendritic corneal ulcers, photophobia, and variable vision loss.
   - **Relation to Case:** Could fit the presentation, especially with pain and blurred vision, but less commonly associated with contact lens use.
   
4. **Herpes Zoster Keratitis:**
   - **Likelihood:** Low. Often preceded by dermatomal rash (herpes zoster ophthalmicus) and may involve uveitis.
   - **Relation to Case:** No history of rash or herpes zoster symptoms mentioned.
   
5. **Pseudomonas Keratitis:**
   - **Likelihood:** High. Common in contact lens users, especially with overnight wear or poor hygiene. Presents with rapid onset of pain, redness, mucopurulent discharge, corneal ulceration, and significant vision impairment.
   - **Relation to Case:** Directly aligns with acute severe presentation, contact lens use, and rapid visual acuity decline.

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 5 (Pseudomonas keratitis)

Qwen's full response:

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 45-year-old male presents with 1-day history of **severe right eye pain**, **marked vision loss** (counting fingers at 3 feet), and difficulty opening the affected eye.  
- Left eye is asymptomatic with normal visual acuity (20/25).  
- Key symptoms: **Sudden unilateral severe eye pain**, **rapid visual acuity loss**, and **contact lens use**.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Sudden onset and progression**: The abrupt development of severe pain and vision loss over 24 hours suggests an acute inflammatory or infectious process.  
- **Unilateral involvement**: Asymptomatic left eye rules out bilateral conditions like epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (unless in early stages).  
- **Contact lens use**: A critical risk factor for **bacterial keratitis**, particularly *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, which is notorious for causing rapid corneal ulcers in contact lens wearers.  
- **Pain severity**: Severe pain is more consistent with corneal involvement (e.g., ulceration) rather than angle-closure glaucoma (which may also cause pain but typically with elevated intraocular pressure and conjunctival injection).  
- **Visual acuity drop**: Counting fingers at 3 feet indicates significant corneal opacification or edema, commonly seen in severe infections or inflammatory conditions.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **1. Angle-closure glaucoma**:  
  - Features like sudden pain and vision loss are possible, but angle-closure typically presents with **marked conjunctival injection**, **mid-dilated fixed pupil**, and **elevated intraocular pressure** (IOP). The patient’s normal vital signs and lack of mention of nausea/vomiting make this less likely.  
  - **Unlikely** due to absence of classic signs (e.g., high IOP) and strong contact lens risk for infection.  

- **2. Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC)**:  
  - Caused by adenovirus, often with **bilateral involvement** (though unilateral in early stages). Presents with **watery discharge**, **chemosis**, and **preauricular lymphadenopathy**.  
  - Severe pain and rapid vision loss are **atypical**; corneal involvement (e.g., dendritic ulcers) would develop later.  
  - **Less likely** given unilateral symptoms and lack of systemic signs.  

- **3. Herpes simplex keratitis (HSK)**:  
  - Causes **dendritic or geographic ulcers** with pain and vision loss. May occur in immunocompromised patients or with reactivation (e.g., stress).  
  - Contact lens use is not a primary risk factor.  
  - **Possible** but less likely than bacterial infection in this context.  

- **4. Herpes zoster keratitis (HZK)**:  
  - Requires **herpes zoster (shingles)** with a dermatomal rash, typically involving the forehead, scalp, or ear.  
  - Absence of rash makes this **unlikely**.  

- **5. Pseudomonas keratitis**:  
  - **Leading cause of corneal ulcers in contact lens wearers**, especially with poor hygiene.  
  - Presents with **severe pain**, **marked visual loss**, and **rapid progression** due to the highly virulent nature of *Pseudomonas*.  
  - Corneal infiltrates/ulcers (seen in the photo) align with this diagnosis.  
  - **Most likely** due to the patient’s risk factors and symptom severity.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 5 (Pseudomonas keratitis)(铜绿假单胞菌性角膜炎)**

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 5 (Pseudomonas keratitis)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Profile**: 45-year-old male, contact lens user, asthma (treated with salbutamol), kindergarten teacher.  
- **Chief Complaint**: 1-day history of progressive right eye pain, blurry vision, and inability to open the eye.  
- **Key Findings**:  
  - **Unilateral symptoms**: Right eye affected; left eye normal (visual acuity 20/25).  
  - **Severe vision loss**: Right eye visual acuity reduced to counting fingers at 3 feet.  
  - **Pain and photophobia**: Severe enough to limit eye opening.  
  - **Risk factors**: Contact lens use (critical for infection risk).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Acute Onset**: Symptoms progressed rapidly over 24 hours, favoring infectious or acute mechanical causes (e.g., bacterial keratitis, angle-closure glaucoma).  
- **Vision Loss**: Severe unilateral vision impairment suggests corneal involvement (e.g., ulceration, edema) or elevated intraocular pressure (IOP).  
- **Pain and Photophobia**: Typical of corneal pathology (infection, inflammation) or acute angle-closure glaucoma.  
- **Contact Lens Use**: Strongly associated with microbial keratitis (e.g., *Pseudomonas*).  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Angle-Closure Glaucoma**:  
   - **Support**: Acute pain, vision loss.  
   - **Against**: No mention of mid-dilated pupil, corneal edema, or systemic symptoms (nausea/vomiting). Contact lens use is not a risk factor.  
   - **Likelihood**: Low.  

2. **Epidemic Keratoconjunctivitis (Adenovirus)**:  
   - **Support**: Contagious setting (kindergarten).  
   - **Against**: Typically bilateral, watery discharge, subacute onset. Severe vision loss and pain are uncommon.  
   - **Likelihood**: Low.  

3. **Herpes Simplex Keratitis**:  
   - **Support**: Unilateral pain, photophobia.  
   - **Against**: Rapid vision loss over 1 day is atypical; classic dendritic ulcers would require fluorescein staining (not mentioned).  
   - **Likelihood**: Moderate but less likely than bacterial.  

4. **Herpes Zoster Keratitis**:  
   - **Support**: Unilateral pain.  
   - **Against**: No vesicular rash (ophthalmic zoster typically precedes or accompanies rash). Age <50 reduces likelihood.  
   - **Likelihood**: Low.  

5. **Pseudomonas Keratitis**:  
   - **Support**: Contact lens use (major risk factor), rapid progression, severe pain/vision loss. *Pseudomonas* is a common pathogen in contact lens-related infections.  
   - **Against**: None; clinical features align perfectly.  
   - **Likelihood**: High.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 5 (Pseudomonas keratitis)(假单胞菌性角膜炎)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - **Contact lens use**: Primary risk factor for *Pseudomonas* keratitis.  
  - **Acute, severe unilateral symptoms**: Rapid vision loss and pain are hallmarks of aggressive bacterial infection.  
  - **Absence of rash/bilateral involvement**: Rules out viral etiologies like herpes zoster or adenovirus.  
  - **Clinical urgency**: Requires immediate corneal scraping and antibiotics, aligning with the described presentation.
