Case_description: 
A previously healthy 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician for evaluation because of loss of appetite, sleeplessness, and extreme irritability for the past 3 weeks. He was recently kicked off of the school's football team after missing too many practices. He has also been avoiding his family and friends because he is not in the mood to see them, but he admits that he is lonely. He has not left his room for 2 days, which prompted his father to bring him to the physician. He has no medical conditions and does not take any medications. He does not drink alcohol or use recreational drugs. While the father is in the waiting room, a mental status examination is conducted, which shows a constricted affect. Cognition is intact. He says that he would be better off dead and refuses to be treated. He says he wants to use his father's licensed firearm to “end his misery” over the weekend when his parents are at church. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options: 
1. Agree to his wish for no further treatment
2. Begin paroxetine therapy
3. Involuntary hospitalization after informing the parents
4. Reassure the patient that he will feel better
5. Start outpatient psychotherapy

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:**  
  - Age: 14 years old  
  - Sex: Male  
  - Health Status: Previously healthy  
- **Chief Complaint:**  
  - Loss of appetite, sleeplessness, and extreme irritability for the past 3 weeks  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - Recent social setback: Kicked off the school's football team for missing practices  
  - Social withdrawal: Avoiding family and friends, not leaving his room for 2 days  
  - Emotional state: Admits to feeling lonely  
  - Mental Status Examination: Constricted affect, intact cognition  
  - Suicidal Ideation: Expresses desire to be dead and plans to use his father's firearm to "end his misery" over the weekend  
  - Refusal of treatment

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline:** Symptoms have been present for 3 weeks, indicating a subacute onset.  
- **Emotional State:** The patient exhibits signs of depression, including loss of appetite, insomnia, irritability, and social withdrawal.  
- **Suicidal Ideation:** He explicitly states he would be better off dead and has a specific plan to use a firearm, indicating a high risk of imminent self-harm.  
- **Social Factors:** Recent exclusion from the football team may have contributed to his emotional distress.  
- **Safety Concerns:** Access to a firearm increases the lethality of any suicide attempt, heightening the urgency for intervention.  
- **Refusal of Treatment:** Despite recognizing his distress, he refuses treatment, which complicates management but does not negate the need for intervention due to the high risk.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Depressive Disorder:** The patient's symptoms align with major depressive disorder, given the duration and nature of symptoms.  
- **Acute Stress Reaction:** Possible considering the recent social setback, but the presence of suicidal ideation with a plan points more towards a depressive disorder.  
- **Other Psychiatric Conditions:** While other conditions like anxiety disorders may be present, the primary concern is the risk of suicide.  

**Evaluation of Diagnostic Options:**  
1. **Agree to his wish for no further treatment:**  
   - **Unsuitable:** Given the high risk of suicide, refusing treatment is not acceptable.  
2. **Begin paroxetine therapy:**  
   - **Insufficient:** While pharmacotherapy may be beneficial, it does not address the immediate risk of suicide.  
3. **Involuntary hospitalization after informing the parents:**  
   - **Appropriate:** Ensures the patient’s safety by providing a controlled environment and immediate intervention.  
4. **Reassure the patient that he will feel better:**  
   - **Inadequate:** Offers no real intervention and ignores the imminent risk.  
5. **Start outpatient psychotherapy:**  
   - **Insufficient:** Outpatient settings do not provide the necessary immediate safety for someone at high risk of suicide.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Involuntary hospitalization after informing the parents)（在通知家長後進行非自願住院）**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 3 (Involuntary hospitalization after informing the parents)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 14-year-old previously healthy male presents with a 3-week history of loss of appetite, sleeplessness, extreme irritability, social withdrawal, and loneliness.  
- He has not left his room for 2 days, prompting parental concern.  
- **Decisive symptoms**: Suicidal ideation with a specific plan (using a firearm when parents are away), refusal of treatment, constricted affect on mental status examination.  

---

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Suicidal Intent and Plan**: The patient’s statement about being “better off dead” and his specific plan to use a firearm when unsupervised indicate **imminent suicide risk**, which is the most critical feature.  
- **Mood Symptoms**: Irritability, anhedonia (avoiding social interactions despite feeling lonely), and constricted affect align with a **major depressive episode**.  
- **Refusal of Treatment**: His refusal complicates management but underscores the urgency of ensuring safety first.  
- **Timeline**: Symptoms developed over 3 weeks, coinciding with being cut from the football team, suggesting a possible stressor but not ruling out an underlying disorder.  

---

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Agree to his wish for no further treatment (Option 1)**:  
   - **Unacceptable**. Active suicidal intent with a lethal plan necessitates immediate intervention. Ethical and legal obligations to prevent harm override patient refusal in this context.  

2. **Begin paroxetine therapy (Option 2)**:  
   - While SSRIs like paroxetine are used in depression, starting medication alone is insufficient here. The patient’s refusal of treatment and high suicide risk require **immediate safety measures** first. Additionally, SSRIs carry a boxed warning for increased suicidal ideation in adolescents, necessitating close monitoring.  

3. **Involuntary hospitalization after informing parents (Option 3)**:  
   - **Most appropriate**. The patient’s age, imminent suicide risk, and refusal of outpatient care justify involuntary hospitalization under most jurisdictions’ criteria (e.g., danger to self). Hospitalization ensures safety, allows for comprehensive evaluation, and enables initiation of treatment in a controlled setting.  

4. **Reassure the patient that he will feel better (Option 4)**:  
   - Ineffective. Reassurance alone does not address the acute risk. The patient’s explicit plan and refusal of care necessitate actionable steps, not just verbal comfort.  

5. **Start outpatient psychotherapy (Option 5)**:  
   - Insufficient. Outpatient therapy is part of long-term management but cannot mitigate the **imminent risk** posed by the patient’s lethal plan. Compliance is also uncertain given his refusal of treatment.  

---

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Involuntary hospitalization after informing the parents)(非自愿住院治疗并通知父母)**  

**Key evidence supporting this choice**:  
- The patient’s **suicidal ideation with a specific, lethal plan** constitutes an immediate and grave safety risk.  
- Involuntary hospitalization is legally and ethically justified for minors at imminent risk of self-harm, especially when outpatient measures are unlikely to ensure safety.  
- Hospitalization allows for urgent psychiatric evaluation, crisis stabilization, and initiation of treatment (e.g., psychotherapy, medication) in a controlled environment.

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 3 (Involuntary hospitalization after informing the parents)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Basic Information**: 14-year-old previously healthy boy.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Loss of appetite, sleeplessness, extreme irritability (3 weeks), social withdrawal, and suicidal ideation.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations**:  
  - **Depressive symptoms**: Anhedonia (avoiding family/friends), loneliness, constricted affect, self-isolation.  
  - **Suicidal intent**: Explicit plan to use a firearm with a stated timeline ("over the weekend").  
  - **Functional impairment**: Removed from football team due to missed practices, refusal of treatment.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline**: Symptoms progressed over 3 weeks, escalating to acute suicidal intent.  
- **Characteristics**:  
  - **Psychomotor/emotional changes**: Irritability, social withdrawal, and constricted affect align with major depressive disorder (MDD).  
  - **Suicidal risk**: Specific plan (firearm access), lethality of method, and timing (isolated opportunity) indicate **imminent risk**.  
  - **No substance use or medical conditions**: Rules out substance-induced mood disorder or organic causes.  
- **Interrelationships**: Depressive symptoms (anhedonia, insomnia) likely precipitated social/functional decline, exacerbating suicidal ideation.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Option 1 (Agree to no treatment)**: Contraindicated. Active suicidal intent with a lethal plan necessitates intervention. Ethically and legally unacceptable.  
2. **Option 2 (Paroxetine)**: SSRIs like paroxetine are first-line for MDD, but **contraindicated** here due to acute suicide risk. SSRIs may initially increase suicidal ideation in adolescents, requiring close monitoring—impossible in this unsafe setting.  
3. **Option 3 (Involuntary hospitalization)**: **Strongest alignment**. The patient meets criteria for involuntary commitment: grave disability (inability to care for self) and imminent danger to self. Hospitalization ensures safety, crisis stabilization, and initiation of treatment.  
4. **Option 4 (Reassurance)**: Inadequate. Minimizing suicidality ("reassure he will feel better") ignores acute risk and violates duty to protect.  
5. **Option 5 (Outpatient psychotherapy)**: Insufficient. Outpatient care lacks immediacy for high-risk cases. Firearm access and concrete plan demand urgent containment.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Involuntary hospitalization after informing the parents) (告知父母后强制住院)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - **Imminent suicide risk**: Specific, lethal plan with access to means (firearm) and timeline.  
  - **Ethical/legal obligation**: Duty to protect life supersedes patient autonomy in acute crises.  
  - **Clinical guidelines**: APA and AACAP recommend hospitalization for adolescents with suicidal intent + plan.  
  - **Safety first**: Outpatient options (Options 2/5) require a secure environment, which is absent here.
