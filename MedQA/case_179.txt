Case_id: case_179
Case_description: 
A previously healthy 19-year-old man comes to the physician with right-sided, dull, throbbing scrotal pain for 12 hours. He has also had a burning sensation on urination and increased urinary frequency for the past 3 days. He has not had urethral discharge. He is sexually active with one female partner and does not use condoms. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a tender right testicle; lifting it provides relief. The penis appears normal, with no discharge at the meatus. Laboratory studies show a normal complete blood count; urinalysis shows 3 WBC/hpf. A Gram stain of a urethral swab shows polymorphonuclear leukocytes but no organisms. Testicular ultrasound shows increased blood flow to the right testicle compared to the left. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?
Options: 
1. Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection
2. Testicular tumor
3. Treponema pallidum infection
4. Chlamydia trachomatis infection
5. Varicocele
Correct Answer: Chlamydia trachomatis infection

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** 19-year-old previously healthy man.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Right-sided, dull, throbbing scrotal pain lasting 12 hours.  
- **Additional Symptoms:** Burning sensation during urination and increased urinary frequency for the past 3 days. No urethral discharge.  
- **Sexual History:** Sexually active with one female partner, does not use condoms.  
- **Physical Examination:** Tender right testicle; lifting the testicle provides relief (negative Prehn's sign). Penis appears normal with no discharge at the meatus.  
- **Laboratory Findings:** Normal complete blood count; urinalysis shows 3 WBC/hpf.  
- **Microbiology:** Gram stain of urethral swab shows polymorphonuclear leukocytes but no organisms.  
- **Imaging:** Testicular ultrasound reveals increased blood flow to the right testicle compared to the left (hyperemia).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Scrotal Pain:** Acute onset (12 hours) of unilateral, dull, throbbing scrotal pain suggests conditions like epididymo-orchitis or testicular torsion.  
- **Relief with Testicular Elevation:** Negative Prehn's sign (pain relief upon elevating the testicle) typically associates with epididymo-orchitis rather than torsion, where lifting the testicle would not relieve pain.  
- **Urinary Symptoms:** Burning dysuria and increased frequency over 3 days indicate a probable lower urinary tract infection, possibly related to a sexually transmitted infection (STI).  
- **Sexual History:** Unprotected sexual activity increases the risk of sexually transmitted pathogens causing epididymo-orchitis.  
- **Laboratory Findings:** Presence of WBCs in urine suggests inflammation or infection, but absence of organisms on Gram stain makes certain bacterial infections less likely.  
- **Ultrasound Findings:** Increased blood flow is consistent with epididymo-orchitis (inflammatory process) and opposes testicular torsion, which typically presents with decreased or absent blood flow.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  

1. **Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection (Option 1):**  
   - **Supporting Features:** STI, can cause epididymo-orchitis with urinary symptoms.  
   - **Against:** Typically presents with purulent urethral discharge and Gram-negative intracellular diplococci on Gram stain, which are absent in this case.  

2. **Testicular tumor (Option 2):**  
   - **Supporting Features:** Can present with scrotal pain.  
   - **Against:** Usually presents more chronically and without acute urinary symptoms. Lack of evidence from ultrasound (no mass identified) makes this less likely.  

3. **Treponema pallidum infection (Option 3):**  
   - **Supporting Features:** STI, but primarily causes painless ulcers (chancre) in primary syphilis.  
   - **Against:** Does not typically present with acute epididymo-orchitis-like symptoms or increased testicular blood flow.  

4. **Chlamydia trachomatis infection (Option 4):**  
   - **Supporting Features:** Leading cause of epididymo-orchitis in younger males, especially in sexually active individuals. Can present with urethritis symptoms without purulent discharge. Often not visible on Gram stain.  
   - **Against:** None significant in this context.  

5. **Varicocele (Option 5):**  
   - **Supporting Features:** Can cause scrotal discomfort.  
   - **Against:** Usually presents as a painless "bag of worms" and is more common on the left side. Does not align with acute pain and urinary symptoms.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Chlamydia trachomatis infection) (衣原体感染)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 4 (Chlamydia trachomatis infection)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 19-year-old male presents with right-sided, dull, throbbing scrotal pain for 12 hours and 3 days of dysuria and urinary frequency.  
- Key symptoms include:  
  - Acute scrotal pain relieved by elevation (Prehn sign), suggesting inflammation.  
  - Urinary symptoms (dysuria, frequency) without urethral discharge.  
  - Sexual activity with an unprotected partner.  
  - Lab findings: Urinalysis with 3 WBC/hpf, normal CBC, and testicular ultrasound showing increased blood flow to the right testicle.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline**: Urinary symptoms (dysuria/frequency) preceded scrotal pain by 3 days, suggesting a lower urinary tract infection progressing to genitourinary inflammation.  
- **Symptom Characteristics**:  
  - **Scrotal Pain**: Dull, throbbing nature and relief with elevation point toward inflammation (e.g., epididymo-orchitis) rather than torsion (which typically causes sudden, severe pain worsened by elevation and reduced blood flow on ultrasound). The increased blood flow on ultrasound supports inflammation.  
  - **Urinary Symptoms**: Dysuria and frequency without discharge are classic for urethritis, commonly caused by sexually transmitted infections (STIs).  
  - **Absence of Discharge**: Reduces likelihood of gonorrhea (which often causes purulent discharge) but aligns with chlamydia, which may present without overt discharge.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (N. gonorrhoeae infection)**:  
  - Gonorrhea typically causes purulent urethral discharge, which is absent here. However, asymptomatic cases or mild infections can occur. The Gram stain showing PMNs but no organisms is nonspecific and does not rule out gonorrhea (as it may require culture/PCR). However, the lack of discharge and presence of chlamydia as a common coinfection make this less likely.  
- **Option 4 (C. trachomatis infection)**:  
  - Chlamydia is a leading cause of nongonococcal urethritis and can ascend to the epididymis, causing epididymo-orchitis. It often lacks overt urethral discharge, aligning with the patient’s presentation. The absence of organisms on Gram stain is expected, as Chlamydia is an intracellular pathogen not visible on Gram stain. This diagnosis is strongly supported.  
- **Option 5 (Varicocele)**:  
  - Typically causes chronic, dull pain worsened by standing, not acute relief with elevation. Ultrasound would show venous dilation, not increased blood flow. Unlikely.  
- **Option 2 (Testicular tumor)**:  
  - Rare in adolescents, usually painless, and would not explain acute symptoms or inflammatory findings.  
- **Option 3 (T. pallidum infection)**:  
  - Early syphilis would present with chancres, which are absent here. Later stages (e.g., secondary syphilis) present with systemic symptoms, not isolated scrotal pain.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Chlamydia trachomatis infection)(沙眼衣原体感染)**  

**Key Evidence Supporting This Choice**:  
- The patient’s age, sexual activity, and lack of urethral discharge align with chlamydia as a common cause of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic urethritis.  
- The progression from dysuria/frequency to epididymo-orchitis (with Prehn sign positivity and increased testicular blood flow) is classic for chlamydial infection.  
- Gram stain negativity for organisms and lack of overt gonorrheal discharge make chlamydia far more likely than gonorrhea.  
- Testicular ultrasound findings of increased blood flow support inflammation (chlamydia) over torsion or malignancy.

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 4 (Chlamydia trachomatis infection)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 19-year-old sexually active male, no condom use.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Right-sided dull, throbbing scrotal pain (12 hours) + dysuria and urinary frequency (3 days).  
- **Key Findings**:  
  - Tender right testicle with **relief on elevation (positive Prehn’s sign)**.  
  - Urinalysis: 3 WBC/hpf.  
  - Urethral swab Gram stain: PMNs without organisms.  
  - Testicular ultrasound: **Increased blood flow to the right testicle**.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Acute Scrotal Pain**: Sudden onset (12 hours) with throbbing quality. Positive Prehn’s sign and ultrasound findings (hyperemia) strongly favor **inflammatory process (e.g., epididymitis/orchitis)** over torsion (which reduces blood flow).  
- **Urinary Symptoms**: Dysuria, frequency, and sterile pyuria (3 WBC/hpf) suggest **urethritis**, likely from an STI.  
- **Gram Stain Findings**: PMNs indicate inflammation, but **no organisms** seen. This aligns with **Chlamydia trachomatis** (intracellular, Gram-negative, not visible on Gram stain) rather than **Neisseria gonorrhoeae** (typically shows Gram-negative diplococci).  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Neisseria gonorrhoeae**: Unlikely due to absence of urethral discharge and negative Gram stain for organisms.  
2. **Testicular Tumor**: Typically painless mass; acute pain and inflammatory signs (e.g., hyperemia) contradict this.  
3. **Treponema pallidum (Syphilis)**: Presents with painless chancre or systemic symptoms, not acute epididymitis/urethritis.  
4. **Chlamydia trachomatis**: Matches STI risk factors, PMNs without organisms on Gram stain, and clinical triad of epididymitis (pain, dysuria, hyperemia).  
5. **Varicocele**: Chronic, painless, and associated with "bag of worms" sensation; acute pain and hyperemia exclude this.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Chlamydia trachomatis infection)(沙眼衣原体感染)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - STI risk factors (unprotected sex) + urethritis (dysuria, frequency).  
  - PMNs on Gram stain without visible organisms → Classic for Chlamydia.  
  - Increased testicular blood flow + Prehn’s sign → Epididymitis secondary to ascending Chlamydial infection.
