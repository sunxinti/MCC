Case_description: 
A 54-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of a 2-day history of increasingly severe abdominal pain, nausea, and bilious vomiting. His last bowel movement was yesterday and he has not passed flatus since then. He underwent appendectomy at the age of 39. He has psoriasis, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic back pain. He drinks two beers daily. He takes a topical corticosteroid, ramipril, metformin, and ibuprofen daily. He is 176 cm (5 ft 9 in) tall and weighs 108 kg (240 lb); BMI is 35.4 kg/m2. His temperature is 36.8°C (98.4°F), respirations are 15/min, pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure is 112/67 mm Hg. Examination shows thick, scaly, plaques over both elbows and knees. Abdominal examination shows three well-healed laparoscopic scars. The abdomen is distended and there are frequent, high-pitched bowel sounds on auscultation. Digital rectal examination shows an empty rectum. Laboratory studies show:

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**

- **Patient Information:** 54-year-old male with a history of appendectomy at age 39, psoriasis, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic back pain, daily alcohol consumption (two beers), and daily use of topical corticosteroid, ramipril, metformin, and ibuprofen. BMI is 35.4 kg/m².
  
- **Chief Complaint:** 2-day history of increasingly severe abdominal pain, nausea, and bilious vomiting.
  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:** 
  - No bowel movement or passage of flatus for 2 days.
  - Abdominal distension.
  - Frequent, high-pitched bowel sounds.
  - Digital rectal examination reveals an empty rectum.
  - Abdominal ultrasound shows nonpropulsive peristalsis of the small bowel.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**

- **Timeline and Progression:** Acute onset over 2 days with progressively worsening abdominal pain and vomiting suggests an obstructive process.
  
- **Bowel Movement and Auscultation:** Absence of bowel movements and flatus, combined with high-pitched bowel sounds, are indicative of mechanical small bowel obstruction.
  
- **Past Surgical History:** Previous appendectomy raises the possibility of postoperative adhesions, a common cause of small bowel obstruction.
  
- **Medication Use:** Chronic ibuprofen use could be associated with peptic ulcer disease leading to obstruction, but more commonly linked to gastric ulcers rather than small bowel obstruction.
  
- **Obesity:** While a risk factor for various conditions, obesity is not a direct common cause of small bowel obstruction.
  
- **Alcohol Use:** Excessive alcohol use can lead to pancreatitis or other complications, but the patient’s alcohol consumption appears moderate.
  
- **Laboratory Findings:** Largely unremarkable, which is consistent with early stages of bowel obstruction before significant electrolyte imbalances or infection develop.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**

1. **Chronic Inflammatory Bowel Disease:** Typically presents with chronic symptoms such as diarrhea, weight loss, and abdominal pain. Acute small bowel obstruction is less common and usually related to complications like strictures, which is not directly supported by this patient's history.

2. **Obesity:** While obesity can contribute to certain abdominal conditions, it is not a primary cause of small bowel obstruction. It may complicate the clinical picture but does not directly explain the obstruction.

3. **Ibuprofen:** Chronic use of NSAIDs like ibuprofen is associated with peptic ulcer disease, which can lead to gastric outlet obstruction. However, the ultrasound findings point towards small bowel obstruction rather than gastric.

4. **History of Abdominal Surgery:** Previous surgeries increase the risk of postoperative adhesions, which are the most common cause of small bowel obstruction in patients with prior abdominal operations. This aligns well with the patient’s presentation and imaging findings.

5. **Alcohol:** Moderate alcohol consumption is unlikely to be the primary cause of acute small bowel obstruction. Excessive use could lead to pancreatitis or other issues, but this does not match the clinical scenario.

**4. Final Selection**

**My final selection is: Option 4 (History of abdominal surgery)(既往有腹部手术史)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 4 (History of abdominal surgery)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 54-year-old male with a 2-day history of worsening abdominal pain, nausea, bilious vomiting, no flatus, and no bowel movement since yesterday.  
- **Key Symptoms/Signs**:  
  - **Abdominal distension** and **frequent, high-pitched bowel sounds** (suggesting mechanical bowel obstruction).  
  - **Empty rectum** on digital rectal exam (consistent with obstruction proximal to the rectum).  
  - **Nonpropulsive small bowel peristalsis** on ultrasound (indicative of obstruction).  
  - History of **laparoscopic appendectomy** (increasing adhesion risk).  
  - Chronic comorbidities (psoriasis, hypertension, diabetes) and use of **ibuprofen** and alcohol (two beers daily).  

---

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Symptom Timeline**: Symptoms developed acutely over 2 days, consistent with mechanical obstruction rather than chronic processes.  
- **Bilious vomiting** implies obstruction above the pylorus (small bowel).  
- **Absence of flatus and bowel movement** and **abdominal distension** are classic findings in intestinal obstruction.  
- **High-pitched bowel sounds** (borborygmi) suggest hyperactive bowel efforts against an obstruction.  
- **Nonpropulsive bowel peristalsis** on ultrasound directly supports mechanical obstruction.  
- **History of prior abdominal surgery** (appendectomy) is a critical risk factor for postoperative adhesions, a common cause of small bowel obstruction.  
- **Medications**: Ibuprofen (NSAID) may contribute to mucosal injury, but the acute mechanical obstruction pattern is more consistent with structural causes.  

---

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **1. Chronic inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn’s disease)**:  
  - Unlikely due to the acute onset and obstruction features. Chronic IBD typically presents with chronic, relapsing symptoms (e.g., diarrhea, weight loss). No mucosal inflammation or stricturing is suggested here.  

- **2. Obesity (BMI 35.4)**:  
  - Obesity increases adhesion risk post-surgery but does not directly cause obstruction in isolation. The patient’s prior appendectomy is a more direct cause.  

- **3. Ibuprofen**:  
  - NSAIDs can cause GI ulcers or perforation, but the presentation (obstruction with distension, hyperactive bowel sounds) aligns more with mechanical obstruction rather than perforation or mucosal injury.  

- **4. History of abdominal surgery (appendectomy)**:  
  - **Strongly supports the diagnosis**. Laparoscopic appendectomy carries a 10–15% risk of adhesion-related bowel obstruction, especially in males and those with prior intra-abdominal inflammation. The timing (acute obstruction after prior surgery) and imaging findings are highly consistent with adhesion-related obstruction.  

- **5. Alcohol**:  
  - Two beers daily is unlikely to cause acute obstruction. Alcohol-related pancreatitis or gastritis would present with different lab findings (elevated lipase, amylase, or ALT/AST), which are not evident here.  

---

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (History of abdominal surgery)(腹部手术史)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Prior **appendectomy** increases adhesion risk, a leading cause of small bowel obstruction.  
  - Clinical findings (distension, hyperactive bowel sounds, nonpropulsive peristalsis) and acute onset align with mechanical obstruction.  
  - No features suggest chronic IBD, NSAID-induced injury, or alcohol-related pathology.  
  - Adhesions are the most plausible explanation given the patient’s surgical history and presentation.

DeepSeek is reasoning the answer...

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 4 (History of abdominal surgery)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Profile**: 54-year-old man with obesity (BMI 35.4), hypertension, diabetes, psoriasis, chronic back pain, daily ibuprofen use, and alcohol intake.  
- **Chief Complaint**: 2-day history of severe abdominal pain, bilious vomiting, nausea, no flatus for 1 day, and distended abdomen.  
- **Key Findings**:  
  - **Physical Exam**: Abdominal distension, frequent high-pitched bowel sounds, empty rectum on digital exam.  
  - **Imaging/Labs**: Ultrasound shows **nonpropulsive peristalsis** of the small bowel; mildly elevated GGT (52 U/L), otherwise normal labs.  
  - **History**: Prior appendectomy (laparoscopic scars noted).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline**: Acute onset (2 days) of obstructive symptoms (pain, vomiting, cessation of flatus) in a patient with prior abdominal surgery.  
- **Critical Findings**:  
  - **High-pitched bowel sounds** and **abdominal distension**: Classic for mechanical small bowel obstruction (SBO).  
  - **Nonpropulsive peristalsis on ultrasound**: Suggests ineffective peristalsis, consistent with partial obstruction or early ileus.  
  - **Empty rectum**: Supports proximal obstruction.  
- **Contradictory Features**:  
  - Normal leukocyte count and absence of fever argue against acute inflammation (e.g., IBD or perforation).  
  - No electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia) to suggest paralytic ileus.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Chronic Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)**:  
   - Unlikely. No chronic diarrhea, weight loss, or hematochezia. Normal inflammatory markers (WBC 9,000/mm³).  
2. **Obesity**:  
   - Indirect risk factor (e.g., hernia-related obstruction), but no hernia noted. Not a direct cause.  
3. **Ibuprofen**:  
   - Plausible. Chronic NSAID use can cause small bowel strictures ("diaphragm disease"), leading to obstruction. However, acute presentation is less typical.  
4. **History of Abdominal Surgery**:  
   - **Strongest candidate**. Prior surgery (appendectomy) is the **most common cause of adhesions**, which account for ~60-75% of SBO cases. Laparoscopic scars increase adhesion risk.  
5. **Alcohol**:  
   - Unrelated. No signs of pancreatitis or cirrhosis. Mild GGT elevation is nonspecific (likely due to obesity or alcohol).  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (History of abdominal surgery)(腹部手术史)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Prior appendectomy and laparoscopic scars strongly correlate with **adhesive small bowel obstruction**, the leading cause of SBO.  
  - Clinical triad of abdominal pain, vomiting, and cessation of flatus aligns with mechanical obstruction.  
  - Ultrasound findings (nonpropulsive peristalsis) suggest partial obstruction, often seen in adhesive cases before complete ileus develops.  
  - Chronic NSAID use (Option 3) is secondary, as adhesions are more common and directly linked to surgical history.
