Case_description: 
A 17-year-old girl comes to the physician because of an 8-month history of severe acne vulgaris over her face, upper back, arms, and buttocks.

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** A 17-year-old female.
- **Chief Complaint:** Severe acne vulgaris lasting 8 months.
- **Clinical Manifestations:** Acne presents on the face, upper back, arms, and buttocks, characterized by oily skin, numerous comedones, pustules, and scarring. Previous treatments with oral antibiotics and topical benzoyl peroxide combined with retinoid were partially ineffective.
  
**Key Decisive Features:**
- **Severe Acne Vulgaris:** Persistent and extensive involvement despite initial treatments.
- **Use of Combined Oral Contraceptive Pills:** Initiated as a long-term therapy, suggesting hormonal influence on acne.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
The patient presents with moderate to severe acne vulgaris that is refractory to standard treatments, indicating a potential hormonal component. The initiation of combined oral contraceptive pills (COCPs) is a common therapeutic strategy for hormonal acne, as COCPs can regulate androgen levels, decrease sebum production, and reduce inflammation.

**Timeline and Characteristics:**
- **Duration:** 8 months, indicating a chronic condition.
- **Age and Gender:** Adolescent female, a demographic commonly affected by hormonal acne.

**Interrelationships:**
- **Hormonal Regulation:** COCPs help in stabilizing hormonal fluctuations that contribute to acne.
- **Long-term Therapy:** Suggests benefits beyond acne control, potentially impacting other health risks associated with hormonal imbalance.

**Features Supporting Diagnosis and Treatment Choice:**
- **Oily Skin and Comedones:** Indicative of sebaceous gland hyperactivity, often driven by androgens.
- **Scarring:** Suggests chronic inflammation, necessitating effective long-term management.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
Evaluating each diagnostic option in the context of COCP use:

1. **Hypertension:**  
   - **COCPs and Blood Pressure:** Oral contraceptives can sometimes lead to increased blood pressure, especially in susceptible individuals. Therefore, COCPs may **not** decrease the risk of hypertension and might, in some cases, increase it.

2. **Ovarian Cancer:**  
   - **Protective Effect:** Numerous studies have demonstrated that prolonged use of COCPs is associated with a reduced risk of ovarian cancer. The protective effect increases with the duration of use and can persist for years after discontinuation.

3. **Malignant Melanoma:**  
   - **Association:** Current evidence does not strongly support a protective effect of COCPs against malignant melanoma. Some studies suggest a potential slight increase in risk, but findings are not conclusive.

4. **Cervical Cancer:**  
   - **Risk Factors:** Long-term use of COCPs has been associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer, particularly with prolonged use. They do not decrease the risk of cervical cancer.

5. **Breast Cancer:**  
   - **Risk Consideration:** COCPs may be associated with a slightly increased risk of breast cancer, especially with long-term use. The risk typically decreases after discontinuation of the pills.

**Alignment with Clinical Presentation:**
- **Option 2 (Ovarian Cancer)** aligns well with the protective effects of COCPs, making it the most plausible condition whose risk is decreased by the medication.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Ovarian cancer)(卵巢癌)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 2 (Ovarian cancer)

Qwen's full response:

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 17-year-old female presents with an 8-month history of severe acne vulgaris affecting the face, upper back, arms, and buttocks.  
- Symptoms include oily skin, numerous comedones, pustules, and scarring.  
- Prior treatments (oral antibiotics, topical benzoyl peroxide, retinoid) have not fully resolved symptoms.  
- **Key diagnostic features**: Long-standing severe acne unresponsive to standard therapy, oily skin, and scarring.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline and severity**: The prolonged duration (8 months) and treatment resistance suggest a hormonal component (e.g., androgen excess), a common driver of severe acne.  
- **Clinical presentation**: Comedones and pustules indicate mixed inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne, while scarring highlights disease severity.  
- **Use of combined oral contraceptives**: This therapy is chosen for its anti-androgenic effects (e.g., suppressing ovarian androgen production and modulating sebum production).  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **1. Hypertension**: Combined oral contraceptives may modestly increase blood pressure in some users, particularly in predisposed individuals. They do not reduce hypertension risk.  
- **2. Ovarian cancer**: Long-term use of combined oral contraceptives is strongly associated with a **reduced risk of ovarian cancer**. The protective effect is thought to arise from suppression of ovulation and reduced cyclical ovarian epithelial cell proliferation.  
- **3. Malignant melanoma**: No direct evidence links combined oral contraceptives to melanoma risk reduction. Some studies suggest a slight increased risk of other skin cancers (e.g., basal cell carcinoma), but not melanoma.  
- **4. Cervical cancer**: Combined oral contraceptives may modestly increase cervical cancer risk, particularly with prolonged use, due to hormonal effects on cervical epithelium.  
- **5. Breast cancer**: Most studies show no significant increased risk of breast cancer with combined oral contraceptives, though rare associations exist. No protective effect is established.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Ovarian cancer)(卵巢癌)**  
Key evidence: Combined oral contraceptives are well-established to reduce the risk of ovarian cancer by suppressing ovulation and decreasing ovarian epithelial cell turnover, a mechanism supported by decades of epidemiological studies. This aligns with the clinical context of hormonal therapy use in acne management.

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 2 (Ovarian cancer)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Profile**: 17-year-old female.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Severe acne vulgaris for 8 months, unresponsive to oral antibiotics and topical therapy (benzoyl peroxide + retinoid).  
- **Key Findings**: Oily skin with widespread comedones, pustules, and scarring on the face, upper back, arms, and buttocks.  
- **Decisive Features**: Persistent, treatment-resistant acne involving non-typical areas (buttocks), suggesting hormonal etiology.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline**: Chronic (8 months), progressive despite standard therapies.  
- **Characteristics**: Oily skin, comedones, pustules, and scarring indicate severe acne with androgen-driven sebum overproduction.  
- **Interrelationships**: Resistance to antibiotics/topicals and involvement of hormonally sensitive areas (face, back, buttocks) strongly implicate hyperandrogenism.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (Hypertension)**: COCPs *increase* hypertension risk due to estrogen-induced fluid retention. **Excluded**.  
- **Option 2 (Ovarian cancer)**: COCPs reduce ovarian cancer risk by suppressing ovulation and reducing ovarian epithelial damage. **Strongly supported** (30–50% risk reduction with long-term use).  
- **Option 3 (Malignant melanoma)**: No established protective association with COCPs. **Unlikely**.  
- **Option 4 (Cervical cancer)**: COCPs *increase* cervical cancer risk (HPV cofactor). **Excluded**.  
- **Option 5 (Breast cancer)**: COCPs slightly elevate breast cancer risk (estrogen-progestin effect). **Excluded**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Ovarian cancer)(卵巢癌)**  
- **Key Evidence**: Combined oral contraceptive pills (COCPs) are clinically proven to reduce ovarian cancer risk via ovulation suppression and hormonal modulation. This patient’s hormonal acne aligns with COCPs’ anti-androgenic effects, and long-term use amplifies ovarian cancer protection.
