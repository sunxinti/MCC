**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** A 38-year-old female.  
- **Procedure:** Injection of Candida into the skin.  
- **Clinical Manifestations:** Forty-eight hours post-injection, a 14 mm raised, slightly hardened area is present at the injection site.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline:** The reaction occurs 48 hours after antigen exposure, aligning with a delayed response rather than an immediate one.  
- **Characteristics of Lesion:** A raised and hardened area suggests an inflammatory response localized to the injection site.  
- **Interpretation:** The delayed onset and nature of the lesion are indicative of a hypersensitivity reaction that is not immediate (Type I) but rather delayed, pointing towards Type IV hypersensitivity.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Type I hypersensitivity; eosinophils**  
  - **Analysis:** Type I reactions are immediate (minutes to hours) and involve IgE and mast cells, not primarily eosinophils. The delayed onset does not support Type I.  
- **Option 2: Type IV hypersensitivity; mast cells**  
  - **Analysis:** Type IV involves T cells and macrophages, not primarily mast cells, which are more associated with Type I reactions.  
- **Option 3: Type III hypersensitivity; CD4+ T cells**  
  - **Analysis:** Type III involves immune complexes and is characterized by different clinical manifestations (e.g., serum sickness). CD4+ T cells are more relevant to Type IV.  
- **Option 4: Type IV hypersensitivity; CD4+ T cells**  
  - **Analysis:** Type IV is a delayed hypersensitivity reaction mediated by T cells, particularly CD4+ T helper cells, which aligns with the 48-hour presentation and localized skin reaction.  
- **Option 5: Type I hypersensitivity; macrophages**  
  - **Analysis:** Type I reactions involve mast cells and IgE, not primarily macrophages. Additionally, the delayed reaction does not support Type I involvement.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Type IV hypersensitivity; CD4+ T cells)（IV型超敏反应；CD4+ T细胞）**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 4 (Type IV hypersensitivity; CD4+ T cells)

Qwen's full response:

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 38-year-old female patient developed a 14 mm raised, slightly hardened area at the injection site 48 hours after receiving Candida.  
- The key symptoms are the delayed-onset induration and localized inflammation, which are characteristic of a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline**: The reaction occurs 48 hours post-exposure, which aligns with the typical latency period for **Type IV hypersensitivity** (delayed-type hypersensitivity).  
- **Clinical Characteristics**: The indurated (hardened) and raised lesion is consistent with the classic tuberculin-type reaction, mediated by T cells.  
- **Exclusion of Other Types**:  
  - **Type I** (immediate hypersensitivity) would present within minutes to hours (e.g., urticaria, anaphylaxis) and involve mast cells/eosinophils, not a delayed induration.  
  - **Type III** involves immune complex deposition, leading to systemic or organ-specific inflammation (e.g., arthritis, glomerulonephritis), not localized delayed skin induration.  
  - **Type II** (antibody-mediated cytotoxicity) is unrelated to the described delayed skin reaction.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (Type I; eosinophils)**: Incorrect. Type I reactions are immediate and involve mast cells/basophils, not delayed induration.  
- **Option 2 (Type IV; mast cells)**: Incorrect. Mast cells are involved in Type I reactions, not Type IV.  
- **Option 3 (Type III; CD4+ T cells)**: Incorrect. Type III is antibody/immune complex-driven and does not primarily involve CD4+ T cells.  
- **Option 4 (Type IV; CD4+ T cells)**: Correct. Type IV hypersensitivity is T-cell mediated (CD4+ Th1 cells release cytokines like IFN-γ, recruiting macrophages and causing delayed induration).  
- **Option 5 (Type I; macrophages)**: Incorrect. Macrophages are not primary effector cells in Type I reactions.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Type IV hypersensitivity; CD4+ T cells)(IV型超敏反应；CD4+ T细胞)**

Choice: Option 4 (Type IV hypersensitivity; CD4+ T cells)

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient:** 38-year-old female.  
- **Intervention:** Intradermal injection of *Candida*.  
- **Key manifestation:** A **14 mm raised, slightly hardened area** at the injection site observed **48 hours later**.  
- **Decisive features:** Delayed onset (48 hours), induration (hardening), and absence of immediate symptoms (e.g., itching, wheals).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline:** The reaction occurs **48 hours post-injection**, aligning with **delayed hypersensitivity** (Type IV), which typically peaks at 48–72 hours. Immediate hypersensitivity (Type I) would manifest within minutes.  
- **Lesion characteristics:** Induration and hardening suggest **cell-mediated inflammation** (e.g., T-cell activation and macrophage recruitment), not edema or vasodilation seen in Type I/III reactions.  
- **Opposing features:** No urticaria, bronchospasm, or rapid onset (against Type I). No evidence of immune complex deposition (e.g., vasculitis, against Type III).  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (Type I; eosinophils):** Incorrect. Type I involves IgE, mast cells, and eosinophils, causing immediate reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis). Delayed induration is inconsistent.  
- **Option 2 (Type IV; mast cells):** Incorrect. Mast cells are central to Type I, not Type IV. Type IV is T-cell-driven.  
- **Option 3 (Type III; CD4+ T cells):** Incorrect. Type III involves immune complexes, complement activation, and neutrophils. CD4+ T cells are not central here.  
- **Option 4 (Type IV; CD4+ T cells):** Correct. Type IV hypersensitivity is mediated by **CD4+ T cells** (Th1 subset), which recruit macrophages, causing induration. *Candida* skin tests are classic examples of delayed hypersensitivity.  
- **Option 5 (Type I; macrophages):** Incorrect. Macrophages are not primary effectors in Type I.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Type IV hypersensitivity; CD4+ T cells)(IV型超敏反应；CD4+ T细胞)**  
- **Key evidence:**  
  1. **Delayed timing (48 hours)** pathognomonic for Type IV.  
  2. **Induration** reflects T-cell activation and macrophage-driven inflammation.  
  3. *Candida* skin testing is a clinical standard for assessing **Type IV hypersensitivity**.  
  4. CD4+ T cells (Th1) secrete cytokines (e.g., IFN-γ) to activate macrophages, causing tissue hardening.
