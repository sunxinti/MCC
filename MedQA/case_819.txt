**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**
- **Patient Information:** A 17-year-old female with a height of 168 cm, weight of 63 kg, and a BMI of 22.3 kg/m².
- **Chief Complaint:** Primary amenorrhea (absence of menarche).
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**
  - **Normal Breast Development:** Indicates adequate estrogen effect.
  - **Scant Axillary Hair:** Suggests reduced androgen activity.
  - **Abdominal Examination:** Presence of a firm, nontender left inguinal mass, likely undescended gonadal tissue.
  - **Pelvic Examination:** Blind vaginal pouch, absence of a palpable uterus.
  - **Ultrasonography:** No evidence of uterus or ovaries.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**
- **Primary Amenorrhea with Normal Breast Development:** Suggests functional estrogenic activity, which could be due to peripheral conversion of androgens or endogenous estrogen production.
- **Scant Axillary Hair:** Indicates a possible deficiency or insensitivity to androgens, as axillary and pubic hair development is typically androgen-dependent.
- **Inguinal Mass:** Likely represents undescended testes, which are common in certain intersex conditions.
- **Blind Vaginal Pouch and Absence of Uterus/Ovaries on Imaging:** Suggests the absence of Müllerian structures, which are typically derived from the Müllerian ducts in embryonic development.
- **Interrelationship of Findings:** The combination of female external genitalia with absent Müllerian structures and the presence of undescended testes points towards a disorder of sex development, particularly involving androgen insensitivity.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**
1. **Müllerian Duct Agenesis (Option 1):**
   - **Alignment with Case:** Characterized by the congenital absence of the uterus and upper two-thirds of the vagina with normal ovarian function.
   - **Contradictions:** Patients typically have normal pubic and axillary hair due to intact androgen function. Additionally, Müllerian agenesis does not explain the absence of ovaries on ultrasonography.
   
2. **5-α Reductase Deficiency (Option 2):**
   - **Alignment with Case:** Affects the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), leading to undervirilized genitalia in genetic males.
   - **Contradictions:** Patients usually have ambiguous genitalia at birth and may masculinize during puberty, which is not consistent with the presented female phenotype.

3. **Sex Chromosome Mosaicism (Option 3):**
   - **Alignment with Case:** Can present with a wide range of phenotypes depending on the specific mosaicism.
   - **Contradictions:** The clinical presentation is not specific enough to support this diagnosis without genetic testing.

4. **Sex Chromosome Monosomy (Option 4):**
   - **Alignment with Case:** Typically refers to Turner Syndrome (45,X), characterized by short stature, which is absent in this patient.
   - **Contradictions:** The patient does not exhibit features commonly associated with Turner Syndrome, such as short stature, webbed neck, or cardiac anomalies.

5. **Androgen Insensitivity (Option 5):**
   - **Alignment with Case:** Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (CAIS) presents with a female external phenotype, absent Müllerian structures, undescended testes, normal breast development, and scant or absent pubic and axillary hair.
   - **Supportive Evidence:** The presence of a firm inguinal mass (undescended testes), blind vaginal pouch, normal breast development, and scant axillary hair strongly align with CAIS.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 5 (Androgen insensitivity)(雄激素不敏感)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 5 (Androgen insensitivity)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 17-year-old female presents with primary amenorrhea, normal breast development, scant axillary hair, a firm nontender left inguinal mass, and a blind vaginal pouch.  
- Key decisive signs include the absence of a uterus/ovaries on ultrasonography, normal breast development, and the inguinal mass.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Primary Amenorrhea**: Absence of menstruation by age 16 with no secondary sexual characteristics delay.  
- **Normal Breast Development**: Indicates estrogen production, suggesting functional ovaries or testes.  
- **Scant Axillary Hair**: Suggests impaired androgen action, as axillary hair development depends on androgens.  
- **Blind Vaginal Pouch**: Suggests incomplete Müllerian duct development (uterus absent, vaginal remnant).  
- **Inguinal Mass**: Likely undescended gonads (testes in androgen insensitivity or ovaries in other conditions).  
- **Normal BMI and Stature**: Rules out severe systemic disorders like Turner syndrome (short stature) or malnutrition.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Müllerian Duct Agenesis (MRKH Syndrome)**  
  - **Support**: Absence of uterus/ovaries and blind vaginal pouch align with Müllerian agenesis.  
  - **Contradiction**: Normal breast development requires functional ovaries, which are typically present in MRKH, but the ultrasound shows no ovaries. The inguinal mass is unexplained in this condition.  

- **Option 2: 5-α Reductase Deficiency**  
  - **Support**: Ambiguous genitalia at birth and incomplete virilization in puberty.  
  - **Contradiction**: Normal breast development and no reported genital ambiguity at birth.  

- **Option 3: Sex Chromosome Mosaicism**  
  - **Support**: Could explain variable gonadal/uterine development.  
  - **Contradiction**: Normal breast development and lack of features like short stature (Turner-like) or ambiguous genitalia.  

- **Option 4: Sex Chromosome Monosomy (Turner Syndrome)**  
  - **Support**: Primary amenorrhea and absent uterus/ovaries.  
  - **Contradiction**: Normal breast development (Turner patients lack estrogen production due to streak ovaries) and typical features like short stature are absent.  

- **Option 5: Androgen Insensitivity (Complete)**  
  - **Support**:  
    - **Normal breast development**: Testicular testosterone aromatized to estrogen.  
    - **Scant axillary hair**: Insensitivity to androgens (testosterone/DHT).  
    - **Blind vaginal pouch and absent uterus**: Anti-Müllerian hormone (from testes) suppresses Müllerian duct development.  
    - **Inguinal mass**: Likely undescended testes.  
    - **Genotype**: 46,XY with androgen receptor defect.  
  - **Contradiction**: None; all features align with CAIS.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 5 (Androgen insensitivity)(雄激素不敏感综合征)**

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 5 (Androgen insensitivity)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 17-year-old girl with primary amenorrhea (no menarche).  
- **Key Findings**:  
  - Normal breast development (Tanner stage consistent with puberty).  
  - **Scant axillary hair** (suggests androgen deficiency or insensitivity).  
  - **Left inguinal mass** (firm, nontender).  
  - **Blind vaginal pouch** and absent uterus/ovaries on ultrasonography.  
  - Normal BMI and no significant family/medical history.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Normal breast development**: Indicates functional estrogen production (typical of androgen insensitivity syndrome, where testosterone is aromatized to estrogen).  
- **Scant axillary/pubic hair**: Reflects impaired androgen action (e.g., androgen receptor dysfunction).  
- **Blind vaginal pouch and absent uterus/ovaries**: Suggests Müllerian structure regression (due to anti-Müllerian hormone from testes, as seen in androgen insensitivity).  
- **Inguinal mass**: Likely undescended testes (common in androgen insensitivity syndrome).  
- **Absent uterus/ovaries on imaging**: Rules out Müllerian duct agenesis (ovaries are typically preserved in that condition).  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Müllerian duct agenesis (MRKH syndrome)**:  
   - Excluded due to absent ovaries (MRKH preserves ovaries) and presence of inguinal testes.  
2. **5-α reductase deficiency**:  
   - Presents with ambiguous genitalia at birth and virilization at puberty. Inconsistent with normal female external genitalia and breast development.  
3. **Sex chromosome mosaicism**:  
   - Variable presentations (e.g., mixed gonadal dysgenesis) but typically includes Müllerian structures or ambiguous genitalia. No evidence here.  
4. **Sex chromosome monosomy (Turner syndrome, 45,X)**:  
   - Excluded by normal height (Turner patients are short), and Turner syndrome usually retains a uterus with streak gonads.  
5. **Androgen insensitivity syndrome (Complete AIS)**:  
   - Matches all findings:  
     - 46,XY karyotype with testes (inguinal mass).  
     - Estrogen-driven breast development (via aromatization of testosterone).  
     - Blind vaginal pouch (Müllerian regression due to testicular AMH).  
     - Scant axillary hair (androgen receptor dysfunction).  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 5 (Androgen insensitivity)(雄激素不敏感综合征)**  
- **Key Evidence**: Normal breast development (estrogen activity), absent uterus/ovaries (testes present), blind vaginal pouch (Müllerian regression), scant axillary hair (androgen resistance), and inguinal testes. These findings align with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (46,XY DSD).
