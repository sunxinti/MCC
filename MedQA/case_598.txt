Case_description: 
A 34-year-old woman comes to the physician requesting prenatal care. For the past 2 months, she has had increasing breast tenderness, nausea, 3-kg (6.6-lb) weight gain, and urinary frequency. She is not sure about the date of her last menstrual period. She has been trying to conceive with her husband since she stopped taking oral contraceptives 6 months ago; she was happy to tell him last week that she is pregnant. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows mild, nontender abdominal enlargement. The cervical os is closed. Urine β-hCG is negative. Transvaginal ultrasonography shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options: 
1. Delusion of pregnancy
2. Pseudocyesis
3. Pregnancy
4. Incomplete abortion
5. Ectopic pregnancy
Correct Answer: Pseudocyesis

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**
- **Patient Information:** 34-year-old woman seeking prenatal care.
- **Chief Complaint:** Suspicion of pregnancy with associated symptoms.
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**
  - Duration: Past 2 months.
  - Symptoms: Increasing breast tenderness, nausea, 3-kg (6.6-lb) weight gain, urinary frequency.
  - Physical Signs: Mild, nontender abdominal enlargement; cervical os closed.
  - Diagnostic Findings: Negative urine β-hCG; transvaginal ultrasonography shows no abnormalities.
  - Additional Notes: Unsure of last menstrual period date; has been attempting conception for 6 months since discontinuing oral contraceptives; recently informed husband of suspected pregnancy.
  - Vital Signs: Temperature 37.2°C (99°F), pulse 100/min, blood pressure 110/60 mm Hg.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**
- **Symptom Duration and Timeline:** Symptoms have been present for 2 months, which is longer than the typical early pregnancy symptoms if she had recently conceived.
- **Physical Findings vs. Diagnostic Tests:** Despite symptoms and mild abdominal enlargement, the negative urine β-hCG and normal ultrasonography make an active pregnancy less likely.
- **Psychological Factors:** The patient has been actively trying to conceive and might have heightened anxiety or desire to conceive, potentially influencing her perception of symptoms.
- **Physiological Symptoms Without Confirmatory Tests:** Breast tenderness, nausea, and weight gain can be associated with both pregnancy and psychological conditions mimicking pregnancy.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**
1. **Delusion of Pregnancy:** A psychiatric condition where the patient has a false belief of being pregnant without any physical signs. However, this condition typically lacks physical manifestations.
2. **Pseudocyesis:** A condition where the patient exhibits both psychological belief and physical signs of pregnancy without actual pregnancy. This aligns with the patient's physical symptoms (abdominal enlargement) despite negative diagnostic tests.
3. **Pregnancy:** Unlikely due to negative urine β-hCG and lack of ultrasonographic evidence. Additionally, the timeline of symptom onset does not align with a recent pregnancy.
4. **Incomplete Abortion:** Would typically present with vaginal bleeding and possibly an open cervical os, which are absent in this case.
5. **Ectopic Pregnancy:** Usually presents with acute abdominal pain and may have a positive β-hCG, which is not the case here.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Pseudocyesis)(假孕)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 2 (Pseudocyesis)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 34-year-old woman presents with breast tenderness, nausea, 3-kg weight gain, urinary frequency, and mild abdominal enlargement over 2 months. She believes she is pregnant after stopping oral contraceptives 6 months ago.  
- Key symptoms: Symptoms mimicking pregnancy (breast changes, nausea, weight gain, urinary frequency) but negative urine β-hCG, normal transvaginal ultrasound, and closed cervical os.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Symptoms timeline**: Symptoms began 2 months ago, coinciding with her attempt to conceive after stopping contraceptives. She reported her pregnancy only last week, suggesting a gradual belief in her condition.  
- **Physical exam**: Mild abdominal enlargement and closed cervical os align with no structural pregnancy (e.g., ectopic or intrauterine). Negative β-hCG and normal ultrasound exclude confirmed pregnancy.  
- **Key contradictions**: The absence of detectable hCG and ultrasound abnormalities despite 2 months of pregnancy-like symptoms strongly oppose actual pregnancy (Option 3) or ectopic pregnancy (Option 5). No vaginal bleeding or cervical dilation rules out incomplete abortion (Option 4).  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (Delusion of pregnancy)**: Unlikely, as delusion lacks physical signs like breast tenderness or abdominal enlargement. The patient has objective symptoms, not just psychological belief.  
- **Option 2 (Pseudocyesis)**: Most consistent. Pseudocyesis involves both psychological and physical symptoms mimicking pregnancy, including breast changes, nausea, and abdominal enlargement, despite negative tests and imaging. Common in women with strong desire for pregnancy.  
- **Option 3 (Pregnancy)**: Excluded by negative β-hCG and normal ultrasound. By 2 months post-cessation of contraception, hCG should be detectable if pregnant.  
- **Option 4 (Incomplete abortion)**: Requires cervical dilation or bleeding, neither present here.  
- **Option 5 (Ectopic pregnancy)**: Typically presents with pain, vaginal bleeding, and possibly adnexal mass on ultrasound. Absent in this case.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 Pseudocyesis (假孕)**

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 2 (Pseudocyesis)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Profile**: 34-year-old woman seeking prenatal care.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Breast tenderness, nausea, 3-kg weight gain, urinary frequency for 2 months; uncertain last menstrual period.  
- **Key Clinical Features**:  
  - Symptoms suggestive of pregnancy (breast tenderness, nausea, weight gain, urinary frequency).  
  - Closed cervical os, mild nontender abdominal enlargement.  
  - **Critical Negative Findings**: Urine β-hCG negative, normal transvaginal ultrasound.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline**: Symptoms developed over 2 months; 6 months since stopping oral contraceptives.  
- **Supporting Pregnancy**: Classic pregnancy symptoms (nausea, breast tenderness) and abdominal enlargement.  
- **Contradicting Pregnancy**: Negative urine β-hCG and normal ultrasound at 8 weeks’ gestation (if pregnant, β-hCG should be positive, and ultrasound should show a gestational sac).  
- **Psychogenic Factors**: Strong desire to conceive may drive somatic symptoms (e.g., pseudocyesis).  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Delusion of Pregnancy**: Fixed false belief without physical signs. Patient has objective symptoms (abdominal enlargement, breast tenderness), making this unlikely.  
2. **Pseudocyesis**: Psychogenic condition with physical pregnancy-like symptoms (e.g., amenorrhea, breast changes, abdominal distension) but negative β-hCG and imaging. Aligns with symptoms, negative tests, and psychologic context (prolonged efforts to conceive).  
3. **Pregnancy**: Ruled out by negative β-hCG and ultrasound. At 8 weeks, both should confirm pregnancy.  
4. **Incomplete Abortion**: Requires prior positive β-hCG (now declining). Negative β-hCG and closed os exclude this.  
5. **Ectopic Pregnancy**: Typically presents with positive β-hCG (even low levels) and abnormal ultrasound (e.g., adnexal mass). Negative tests and normal imaging exclude this.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Pseudocyesis)(假性妊娠)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Pregnancy-like symptoms (nausea, breast tenderness, abdominal enlargement) with negative β-hCG and normal ultrasound.  
  - Psychologic context (prolonged attempts to conceive) supports pseudocyesis.  
  - Closed cervical os and absence of bleeding/abnormal ultrasound rules out incomplete abortion and ectopic pregnancy.
