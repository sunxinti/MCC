Case_description: 
A 67-year-old woman with depression comes to the physician because of easy bruising and bleeding of her gums for the past 2 months. She has been living alone since the death of her husband 1 year ago. She appears thin and has temporal wasting bilaterally.

This patient's symptoms are most likely due to defective synthesis of a substance that is composed primarily of which of the following amino acids?
Options: 
1. Glycine
2. Proline

GPT's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**
- **Patient Information:** 67-year-old woman with a history of depression.
- **Chief Complaint:** Easy bruising and gum bleeding over the past 2 months.
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**
  - Easy bruising on lower legs.
  - Swollen gums.
  - Petechiae on the hard palate.
  - Temporal wasting and appearing thin, suggesting possible malnutrition or chronic illness.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**
- **Symptoms Timeline:** The patient has experienced bruising and gum bleeding for 2 months, indicating a subacute process.
- **Bleeding Manifestations:** Easy bruising, gum bleeding, and petechiae suggest a defect in collagen synthesis or platelet function.
- **Physical Signs:** Temporal wasting and being thin may point towards malnutrition, decreased protein synthesis, or chronic systemic disease.
- **Psychosocial Factors:** Living alone since her husband's death may contribute to inadequate nutrition or poor self-care.
- **Differential Considerations:**
  - **Scurvy (Vitamin C Deficiency):** Impairs collagen synthesis due to defective hydroxylation of proline and lysine, leading to weakened blood vessels and bleeding symptoms.
  - **Vitamin K Deficiency:** Typically presents with prolonged bleeding times but is less likely to cause gum bleeding and petechiae without other coagulation abnormalities.
  - **Platelet Disorders:** Such as thrombocytopenia, but absence of other signs like petechiae elsewhere makes this less likely.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**
- **Option 1: Glycine**
  - **Relevance:** Glycine is a major component of collagen, constituting approximately one-third of its amino acid composition.
  - **Clinical Alignment:** Defective collagen synthesis due to impaired glycine incorporation can lead to weakened blood vessels, resulting in easy bruising and gum bleeding.
- **Option 2: Proline**
  - **Relevance:** Proline is critical for collagen stability; hydroxylation of proline is essential for forming stable collagen triple helices.
  - **Clinical Alignment:** Deficiency affects collagen strength, but glycine has a more prominent role in collagen structure.
- **Option 3: Tyrosine**
  - **Relevance:** Involved in thyroid hormone synthesis and catecholamine production, not directly related to collagen synthesis.
  - **Clinical Alignment:** Less likely to be related to the presented symptoms.
- **Option 4: Lysine**
  - **Relevance:** Important for collagen cross-linking; hydroxylation of lysine is vital for collagen stability.
  - **Clinical Alignment:** While important, glycine has a more substantial presence in collagen.
- **Option 5: Arginine**
  - **Relevance:** Involved in nitric oxide synthesis and protein synthesis but not specifically tied to collagen synthesis defects.
  - **Clinical Alignment:** Less relevant to the bleeding and bruising symptoms.

Qwen's full response:

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 67-year-old woman with depression presents with a 2-month history of easy bruising, gum bleeding, and petechiae. She has temporal wasting and lives alone since her husband’s death.  
- Key symptoms include:  
  - Bruising on lower legs.  
  - Swollen gums and petechiae on the hard palate.  
  - Temporal wasting (suggestive of malnutrition or chronic illness).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Bleeding manifestations**: Gum bleeding, petechiae, and bruising indicate a bleeding diathesis. These are classic features of **collagen vascular fragility**, often seen in disorders like scurvy or vitamin C deficiency.  
- **Temporal wasting**: Suggests possible nutritional deficiency, which aligns with scurvy caused by poor dietary intake (e.g., due to depression or social isolation).  
- **Swollen gums**: In scurvy, gum hypertrophy and bleeding are hallmark signs due to weakened vascular support in periodontal tissues.  
- **Petechiae and bruising**: Reflect defective collagen synthesis leading to fragile capillaries.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (Glycine)**: Collagen is primarily composed of glycine (~30–35% of its amino acids). Glycine is critical for the triple helix structure of collagen. Defective collagen synthesis due to vitamin C deficiency (scurvy) would impair glycine’s role in maintaining vascular integrity.  
- **Option 2 (Proline)**: Proline and hydroxyproline (~15% each) are also key components of collagen. However, their hydroxylation (dependent on vitamin C) is defective in scurvy, but the question focuses on the **composition** of the defective substance (collagen), not the defect’s mechanism.  
- **Option 3 (Tyrosine)**: Involved in melanin, neurotransmitters, and hormones. Not directly related to collagen synthesis.  
- **Option 4 (Lysine)**: Hydroxylysine is a minor component of collagen. While its hydroxylation requires vitamin C, it is less abundant than glycine or proline.  
- **Option 5 (Arginine)**: Not a major component of collagen.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The patient’s symptoms (petechiae, gum bleeding, bruising) strongly suggest **scurvy** due to vitamin C deficiency. Collagen, the defective substance in this scenario, is **primarily composed of glycine** (the most abundant amino acid in collagen). While proline’s hydroxylation is impaired in scurvy, the question specifically asks for the amino acid that constitutes the defective substance (collagen).

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 1 (Glycine)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Profile**: 67-year-old woman with depression, living alone, appearing thin with bilateral temporal wasting.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Easy bruising and gum bleeding for 2 months.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations**:  
  - Bruises on lower legs.  
  - Swollen gums and petechiae on the hard palate.  
- **Decisive Signs**: Mucosal bleeding (gums), petechiae (indicative of capillary fragility), and bruising in the context of malnutrition (temporal wasting, thin appearance).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline and Characteristics**:  
  - Chronic symptoms (2 months) align with nutritional deficiencies.  
  - Bruising, gum bleeding, and petechiae suggest impaired connective tissue integrity or clotting dysfunction.  
- **Interrelationships**:  
  - Mucosal bleeding and petechiae point to vascular fragility, often seen in **vitamin C deficiency (scurvy)**, which disrupts collagen synthesis.  
  - Temporal wasting and thin appearance support malnutrition as the underlying cause.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Glycine**  
  - Collagen is composed of ~33% glycine, forming its triple-helix structure. Defective collagen synthesis (e.g., scurvy) directly correlates with glycine-rich collagen deficiency.  
- **Option 2: Proline**  
  - Proline is hydroxylated to hydroxyproline in collagen, a step requiring vitamin C. While critical for collagen stability, proline is not the **primary** constituent.  
- **Option 3: Tyrosine**  
  - Involved in thyroid hormones and melanin synthesis, unrelated to bleeding symptoms.  
- **Option 4: Lysine**  
  - Hydroxylated in collagen synthesis (vitamin C-dependent) but less abundant than glycine.  
- **Option 5: Arginine**  
  - Plays roles in nitric oxide synthesis and urea cycle, not central to collagen structure.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1 (Glycine)(甘氨酸)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - The patient’s symptoms (vascular fragility, bleeding) indicate defective collagen synthesis, as seen in scurvy.  
  - Collagen’s primary amino acid is glycine (~33% of its composition), forming its structural backbone. While proline/lysine hydroxylation is vitamin C-dependent, the question explicitly asks about the **primary** amino acid in the substance (collagen).
