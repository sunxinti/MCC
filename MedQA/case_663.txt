**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** A 58-year-old man with a 15-year history of hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Sudden-onset right-sided body numbness lasting for 1 hour.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - Decreased sensation to light pinprick and temperature on the right side of the face and body.  
  - Motor strength is preserved (5/5) with normal deep tendon reflexes (2+) bilaterally.  
- **Decisive Signs:** Sudden sensory deficits affecting both the face and body on the right side without accompanying motor weakness.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline:** Acute onset (1 hour), suggesting a vascular event such as a stroke.  
- **Sensory Characteristics:** The loss of pain and temperature sensation points towards involvement of the spinothalamic tract, which carries these modalities.  
- **Motor Examination:** Absence of motor deficits indicates that motor pathways (e.g., corticospinal tract) are likely intact.  
- **Affected Areas:** Both face and body sensory loss suggests a lesion that affects sensory relay centers receiving inputs from both trigeminal and spinal pathways.  
- **Hypertension History:** Chronic hypertension is a significant risk factor for small vessel disease and stroke, particularly lacunar strokes affecting deep brain structures.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Parietal lobe**  
  - *Analysis:* Parietal lobe lesions typically involve contralateral sensory deficits but often include higher-order sensory disturbances (e.g., proprioception, spatial neglect). The absence of motor deficits makes this less likely.  
- **Option 2: Posterior limb of the internal capsule**  
  - *Analysis:* The posterior limb contains both motor and sensory fibers. Isolated sensory deficits without motor involvement are less common, making this option less consistent with the clinical presentation.  
- **Option 3: Lateral medulla**  
  - *Analysis:* Lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome presents with sensory deficits but also includes other signs like dysphagia, hoarseness, vertigo, and Horner’s syndrome. The absence of these features makes this option unlikely.  
- **Option 4: Basal pons**  
  - *Analysis:* Pontine lesions often present with a combination of motor and sensory deficits, cranial nerve involvement, and potentially facial weakness, which are not observed in this patient.  
- **Option 5: Ventral thalamus**  
  - *Analysis:* The ventral thalamus is a key relay center for sensory information, including pain and temperature from both the face (via the trigeminal nerve) and body (via the spinothalamic tract). A lesion here can cause contralateral sensory loss without motor deficits, aligning well with the patient's presentation.

**My final selection is: Option 5 (Ventral thalamus)(腹侧丘脑)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 5 (Ventral thalamus)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 58-year-old man presents with sudden-onset right-sided numbness (face and body) lasting 1 hour.  
- History of hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide.  
- Alert and oriented, with intact motor strength (5/5) and normal reflexes (2+ bilaterally).  
- **Decisive symptoms**: Unilateral sensory loss to light touch and temperature on the right side without motor weakness or reflex changes.  

---

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Sudden onset** suggests an acute process (e.g., stroke).  
- **Isolated sensory deficit** (no motor weakness) points toward a lesion in the sensory pathway rather than the motor pathway.  
- **Bilateral reflexes and intact strength** exclude involvement of the corticospinal or corticobulbar tracts.  
- **Bilateral sensory pathways** (spinothalamic and medial lemniscus) are likely affected. The spinothalamic tract carries pain/temperature, while the medial lemniscus carries fine touch/vibration. The patient’s deficit in both modalities suggests involvement of a central relay station (e.g., thalamus) or a structure common to both pathways.  

---

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Parietal lobe (Option 1)**: Lesions here cause complex sensory deficits (e.g., agraphesthesia, stereognosis) and may involve higher-order sensory processing. However, isolated face and body numbness without cortical signs (e.g., aphasia if left-sided) make this less likely.  
2. **Posterior limb of the internal capsule (Option 2)**: Contains sensory (medial lemniscus, spinothalamic tract) and motor pathways. A lesion here would typically cause contralateral motor/sensory deficits. However, the patient’s intact motor strength makes this less likely unless the lesion spares the corticospinal tract—possible but less common.  
3. **Lateral medulla (Option 3)**: Lateral medullary syndrome (Wallenberg syndrome) causes ipsilateral cranial neuropathies (e.g., dysphagia, Horner’s syndrome) and contralateral pain/temperature loss. The absence of cranial nerve deficits makes this unlikely.  
4. **Basal pons (Option 4)**: Pontine lesions often involve motor pathways (e.g., corticospinal tract), leading to contralateral weakness. The absence of motor deficits here reduces its likelihood.  
5. **Ventral thalamus (Option 5)**: The ventroposterior nucleus (part of the ventral thalamus) is the primary relay for sensory information from the body and face. A lesion here causes **contralateral hemisensory loss** (face and body), aligning perfectly with the patient’s presentation. This is a classic presentation of thalamic stroke, often due to small-vessel ischemia in hypertensive patients.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 5 (Ventral thalamus)(丘脑腹侧)**  

**Key evidence**:  
- The patient’s isolated contralateral sensory deficit (face and body) without motor involvement strongly suggests a lesion in the sensory pathway’s central relay—the ventral thalamus.  
- Hypertension increases the risk of lacunar strokes, which commonly affect the thalamus and produce "pure sensory strokes."  
- The posterior limb of the internal capsule (Option 2) is less likely due to the absence of motor deficits, though it cannot be fully excluded. However, the ventral thalamus is the most precise and supported choice.

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 5 (Ventral thalamus)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 58-year-old man with 15-year history of hypertension (treated with hydrochlorothiazide).  
- **Chief Complaint**: Sudden-onset right-sided body numbness for 1 hour.  
- **Key Findings**:  
  - Decreased sensation to light pinprick and temperature on the right face and body.  
  - Normal motor strength (5/5) and symmetric deep tendon reflexes (2+).  
  - Alert, oriented, and no motor deficits.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Sudden Onset**: Highly suggestive of an acute vascular event (e.g., ischemic stroke).  
- **Pure Sensory Deficit**: Isolated contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation (spinothalamic modalities) without motor, cerebellar, or brainstem signs.  
- **Topography**: Involvement of both the right face and body indicates a lesion affecting sensory pathways after convergence of facial (trigeminal) and body (spinothalamic) fibers.  
- **Motor Sparing**: Excludes structures with corticospinal tract involvement (e.g., posterior limb of internal capsule, basal pons).  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Parietal Lobe**:  
   - Primary sensory cortex lesions cause contralateral sensory loss but typically localize to specific body regions (e.g., face or body alone).  
   - Rarely causes isolated, complete hemisensory loss without cortical signs (e.g., neglect, apraxia).  
   - **Less Likely**.  

2. **Posterior Limb of Internal Capsule**:  
   - Contains corticospinal (motor) and thalamocortical (sensory) fibers.  
   - Lesions here cause contralateral hemiparesis + hemisensory loss.  
   - **Excluded** due to normal motor function.  

3. **Lateral Medulla (Wallenberg Syndrome)**:  
   - Causes ipsilateral facial pain/temperature loss (spinal trigeminal nucleus) and contralateral body pain/temperature loss (spinothalamic tract).  
   - Associated with vertigo, Horner’s syndrome, dysphagia.  
   - **Inconsistent** with ipsilateral face and body involvement.  

4. **Basal Pons**:  
   - Affects corticospinal tracts (motor deficits) and/or medial lemniscus/spinothalamic tracts.  
   - Typically presents with motor signs (e.g., hemiparesis, ataxia) ± sensory loss.  
   - **Unlikely** due to isolated sensory deficit.  

5. **Ventral Thalamus**:  
   - Ventral posterolateral (VPL) and ventral posteromedial (VPM) nuclei integrate sensory input from the body and face, respectively.  
   - Thalamic infarcts classically present with isolated contralateral hemisensory loss (all modalities).  
   - **Most Consistent** with pure sensory deficit involving face and body.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 5 (Ventral thalamus)(腹侧丘脑)**  
- **Key Evidence**: Sudden-onset contralateral hemisensory loss (face + body) with preserved motor function localizes to the ventral thalamus, which integrates sensory pathways without involving motor tracts. This aligns with the classic presentation of a thalamic infarct.
