Case_description: 
A 60-year-old woman presents to the outpatient clinic complaining of severe vulvar itching that has been gradually worsening for the past year. She mentions that she has tried over-the-counter lubricants, but lubricants do not seem to provide substantial relief. Her medical history is remarkable for diet-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide. Menopause occurred at 52 years of age. She has been sexually active with her husband until recently and reports severe pain during vaginal intercourse. The physical examination reveals dry, thin, white plaque-like lesions in the vulvar area with atrophy of the labia minora. The clitoris appears retracted. The perianal skin appears pale and wrinkled. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options: 
1. Squamous cell hyperplasia
2. Lichen sclerosus
3. Squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva
4. Lichen planus
5. Atrophic vaginitis
Correct Answer: Lichen sclerosus

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** 60-year-old postmenopausal woman (menopause at 52), with a history of diet-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension managed with hydrochlorothiazide.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Severe vulvar itching progressively worsening over the past year.  
- **Additional Symptoms:** Severe pain during vaginal intercourse (dyspareunia).  
- **Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - Dry, thin, white plaque-like lesions in the vulvar area.  
  - Atrophy of the labia minora.  
  - Retracted clitoris.  
  - Pale and wrinkled perianal skin.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Chronicity and Progression:** The symptoms have been gradually worsening over a year, indicating a chronic condition.  
- **Vulvar Itching and Pain:** Persistent itching and dyspareunia are common in various vulvar dermatoses.  
- **Physical Examination Findings:**  
  - **Dry, Thin, White Plaques:** Suggestive of a sclerotic or lichenoid process.  
  - **Atrophy of Labia Minora and Retracted Clitoris:** Indicative of estrogen deficiency effects, common in postmenopausal women but also seen in specific dermatologic conditions.  
  - **Pale and Wrinkled Perianal Skin:** Suggests skin atrophy and possible sclerosis extending beyond the vulva.  
- **Medication and Comorbidities:** Hydrochlorothiazide is not typically associated with the current symptoms. Diabetes may predispose to certain skin conditions but is not directly indicative here.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Squamous Cell Hyperplasia:**  
   - **Alignment:** Can present with thickened, scaly plaques.  
   - **Opposition:** Less likely to cause severe itching and the specific sclerosis signs observed.

2. **Lichen Sclerosus:**  
   - **Alignment:**  
     - Presents with white, atrophic plaques on the vulva.  
     - Causes severe pruritus and dyspareunia.  
     - Associated with skin thinning, clitoral retraction, and possible extension to perianal areas.  
     - Common in postmenopausal women.  
   - **Supports:** Consistent with nearly all clinical features described.

3. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Vulva:**  
   - **Alignment:** May present as vulvar lesions but typically with more localized masses, ulcers, or nodules.  
   - **Opposition:** Absence of suspicious lesions such as ulceration, nodules, or significant mass effect makes this less likely.

4. **Lichen Planus:**  
   - **Alignment:** Can affect the vulva, presenting with white, lacy patterns (Wickham striae).  
   - **Opposition:** Often more violaceous and less associated with sclerosis and skin atrophy seen in this case.

5. **Atrophic Vaginitis:**  
   - **Alignment:** Results from estrogen deficiency, presenting with vaginal dryness and dyspareunia.  
   - **Opposition:** Does not account for the white plaque-like lesions and sclerosis of the vulvar and perianal skin.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Lichen sclerosus) (僵皮型苔藓)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 2 (Lichen sclerosus)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 60-year-old postmenopausal woman presents with worsening vulvar itching over one year, unrelieved by OTC lubricants. She has severe dyspareunia and physical examination reveals dry, thin, white plaques on the vulva, labial atrophy, retracted clitoris, and pale, wrinkled perianal skin.  
- **Decisive features**: White plaques, vulvar atrophy, perianal skin involvement, and severe pruritus despite lubricant use.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline and Symptoms**: Chronic pruritus (one year), progression of symptoms, and lack of relief from lubricants suggest a dermatologic or chronic inflammatory process rather than transient irritation.  
- **Physical Findings**:  
  - **White plaques and skin thinning**: Suggest chronic inflammation or autoimmune etiology (e.g., lichen sclerosus).  
  - **Labial atrophy, retracted clitoris, and perianal changes**: Indicate long-standing fibrosis and tissue destruction, typical of lichen sclerosus.  
  - **Dyspareunia**: Caused by vulvar fragility and scarring from chronic disease.  
- **Differential Considerations**:  
  - **Atrophic vaginitis (Option 5)**: Causes vaginal dryness and dyspareunia but lacks the hallmark white plaques and severe skin atrophy seen here.  
  - **Lichen planus (Option 4)**: Presents with purple, reticulated plaques, not white atrophic lesions.  
  - **Squamous cell carcinoma (Option 3)**: Typically involves ulceration or masses, not diffuse atrophy.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Lichen sclerosus (Option 2)**:  
  - **Supporting features**: White plaques, skin thinning, perianal involvement, and severe pruritus. Classic findings include "cigarette paper" appearance of the vulva, labial atrophy, and scarring.  
  - **Alignment**: The chronic course, progression of atrophy, and lack of response to lubricants align perfectly with lichen sclerosus.  
- **Atrophic vaginitis (Option 5)**:  
  - **Opposing features**: While vulvar atrophy and dyspareunia occur in postmenopausal women, the presence of white plaques and perianal skin changes are absent in simple estrogen deficiency.  
- **Squamous cell hyperplasia (Option 1)**:  
  - **Opposing features**: Characterized by thickened, hyperpigmented skin (not thin, white plaques).  
- **Squamous cell carcinoma (Option 3)**:  
  - **Opposing features**: Malignant lesions are asymmetric, ulcerated, or nodular, not diffuse atrophy.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 Lichen sclerosus (硬斑病)**

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 2 (Lichen sclerosus)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Profile**: 60-year-old postmenopausal woman with type 2 diabetes (diet-controlled) and hypertension.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Severe vulvar itching (1 year), worsening gradually, unresponsive to lubricants. Pain during intercourse (dyspareunia).  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations**:  
  - Dry, thin, white plaque-like vulvar lesions.  
  - Atrophy of labia minora, retracted clitoris.  
  - Pale, wrinkled perianal skin.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Chronic Itching and Pain**: Persistent vulvovaginal symptoms suggest a chronic inflammatory or degenerative condition. Lack of response to lubricants argues against simple atrophy (e.g., atrophic vaginitis).  
- **Physical Findings**:  
  - **White Plaques and Atrophy**: Classic for lichen sclerosus (LS), which causes epithelial thinning and sclerosis.  
  - **Clitoral Retraction and Labial Atrophy**: Indicate scarring and structural changes, consistent with advanced LS.  
  - **Perianal Involvement**: Pale, wrinkled skin extending to the perianal area aligns with LS’s “figure-of-eight” distribution.  
- **Timeline**: Gradual progression over a year supports LS, which often worsens without treatment.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Squamous Cell Hyperplasia**: Presents with thickened, leathery skin (hyperkeratosis) and pruritus. Contradicted by the **thin, atrophic** appearance here.  
2. **Lichen Sclerosus (LS)**:  
   - **Supports**: White plaques, atrophy, clitoral retraction, perianal involvement.  
   - **Alignment**: LS is the hallmark of vulvar sclerosis and scarring, with characteristic extra-vulvar (perianal) changes.  
3. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**: Typically presents as ulcers, nodules, or irregular masses. Absence of these features makes this less likely.  
4. **Lichen Planus**: Erosive lesions, erythema, or Wickham’s striae are common. The absence of mucosal erosions and perianal sparing in this case argues against it.  
5. **Atrophic Vaginitis**: Primarily causes vaginal dryness and mucosal thinning. Lack of improvement with lubricants and vulvar/perianal findings exclude this as the primary diagnosis.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Lichen sclerosus)(硬化性苔藓)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - **White Plaques and Atrophy**: Pathognomonic for LS.  
  - **Perianal Involvement**: Distinctive “figure-of-eight” pattern.  
  - **Clitoral Retraction and Labial Atrophy**: Reflect chronic scarring, a hallmark of LS progression.  
  - **Exclusion of Alternatives**: Absence of hyperkeratosis (squamous hyperplasia), erosions (lichen planus), or masses (carcinoma).
