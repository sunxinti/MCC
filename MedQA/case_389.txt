Case_description: 
A 27-year-old gentleman is brought into the ED after being stabbed in the back by a knife. In addition to the pain from the wound, he complains of weakness in his left leg. Upon physical examination you find that he has no other visible injuries; however, he has 2/5 strength in the left lower extremity. Complete neurologic exam also finds a deficit in vibration sense and light touch on the left lower extremity as well as a loss of pain and temperature sensation in the right lower extremity. Which of the following lesions would result in the syndrome described?
Options: 
1. Anterior cord lesion
2. Posterior cord lesion
3. Right cord hemisection
4. Left cord hemisection
5. Complete cord transection

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** 27-year-old male.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Stab wound to the back with associated pain and weakness in the left leg.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - **Motor Deficit:** Left lower extremity strength is 2/5.  
  - **Sensory Deficits:**  
    - Left lower extremity: Loss of vibration sense and light touch.  
    - Right lower extremity: Loss of pain and temperature sensation.  
- **Additional Findings:** No other visible injuries.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Mechanism of Injury:** Penetrating trauma (stab wound) likely affecting the spinal cord.  
- **Motor Deficit:** Unilateral weakness suggests involvement of the corticospinal tract on the same side (ipsilateral).  
- **Sensory Deficits:**  
  - **Vibration and Light Touch Loss:** These modalities are carried by the dorsal columns on the ipsilateral side.  
  - **Pain and Temperature Loss:** These are transmitted by the anterolateral system and cross to the contralateral side shortly after entering the spinal cord.  
- **Pattern of Deficits:** The combination of ipsilateral motor and dorsal column deficits with contralateral anterolateral sensory loss is characteristic of a hemisection of the spinal cord.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Anterior cord lesion**  
  - Typically presents with loss of motor function and pain/temperature sensation bilaterally below lesion due to damage to the corticospinal and anterolateral tracts.  
  - Does not account for the unilateral sensory and motor deficits observed.  
- **Option 2: Posterior cord lesion**  
  - Affects dorsal columns leading to bilateral loss of proprioception and vibration sense.  
  - Does not explain the contralateral pain and temperature loss or unilateral motor deficit.  
- **Option 3: Right cord hemisection**  
  - Would result in ipsilateral motor and dorsal column deficits on the right and contralateral pain/temperature loss on the left.  
  - However, the patient's motor and dorsal column deficits are on the left, making this option inconsistent.  
- **Option 4: Left cord hemisection**  
  - Aligns with the patient's symptoms: ipsilateral (left) motor weakness and dorsal column deficits, and contralateral (right) pain and temperature loss.  
  - Consistent with Brown-Séquard syndrome resulting from hemisection.  
- **Option 5: Complete cord transection**  
  - Would lead to bilateral motor and sensory deficits below the level of injury, without the distinct unilateral pattern observed.  
  - Does not match the patient's asymmetric presentation.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Left cord hemisection) (左侧弓形切除)**

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 27-year-old male presents to the ED after a stab wound to the back.  
- Chief complaints include left leg weakness (2/5 strength) and sensory deficits.  
- Physical examination reveals:  
  - **Left lower extremity**: 2/5 motor strength, vibration sense, and light touch deficits (posterior column functions).  
  - **Right lower extremity**: Loss of pain and temperature sensation (spinothalamic tract functions).  
- The critical finding is the **contralateral loss of pain/temperature sensation** alongside **ipsilateral motor and posterior column deficits**, which is decisive for diagnosis.  

---

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Motor deficit (left leg weakness)**: Indicates involvement of the corticospinal tract (which is ipsilateral to the lesion).  
- **Sensory deficits**:  
  - **Left-sided vibration and light touch loss** (posterior column functions) suggests damage to the posterior spinal columns on the same side as the lesion.  
  - **Right-sided pain/temperature loss** (contralateral to the motor deficit) indicates damage to the spinothalamic tract, which crosses to the opposite side at the spinal cord level.  
- The combination of **ipsilateral motor and posterior column deficits** with **contralateral spinothalamic deficits** is pathognomonic for a **hemisection lesion** (Brown-Séquard syndrome).  
- The stab injury mechanism supports a focal spinal cord injury, consistent with a hemisection.  

---

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **1. Anterior cord lesion**:  
  - Affects motor function and spinothalamic tracts (pain/temperature) **ipsilaterally**, sparing posterior columns.  
  - Contradicts the case because the patient has **contralateral pain/temperature loss** and **posterior column deficits**.  
- **2. Posterior cord lesion**:  
  - Causes **ipsilateral loss of vibration/proprioception** but spares motor and spinothalamic tracts.  
  - Does not explain the motor weakness or contralateral sensory loss.  
- **3. Right cord hemisection**:  
  - Would cause **right-sided motor weakness and posterior column deficits** with **left-sided pain/temperature loss**.  
  - Contradicts the patient’s **left-sided motor deficits** and **right-sided sensory loss**.  
- **4. Left cord hemisection**:  
  - **Ipsilateral motor weakness** (corticospinal tract) and **posterior column deficits** (vibration/light touch).  
  - **Contralateral spinothalamic deficits** (pain/temperature loss on the right).  
  - Perfectly matches the patient’s presentation.  
- **5. Complete cord transection**:  
  - Causes **total motor and sensory loss bilaterally below the lesion**.  
  - Does not explain the lateralized pattern of deficits.  

---

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Left cord hemisection)(左侧脊髓半切征)**  

**Key evidence**:  
- **Left-sided motor weakness** (corticospinal tract damage).  
- **Left-sided posterior column deficits** (vibration/light touch).  
- **Right-sided spinothalamic deficits** (pain/temperature loss, due to contralateral spinothalamic tract involvement).  
- This pattern is classic for **Brown-Séquard syndrome**, caused by a **left-sided spinal cord hemisection**.

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 27-year-old male with a stab wound to the back.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Left leg weakness and pain at the wound site.  
- **Key Findings**:  
  - **Left lower extremity weakness** (2/5 strength).  
  - **Ipsilateral deficits**: Loss of vibration sense and light touch (left leg).  
  - **Contralateral deficit**: Loss of pain and temperature sensation (right leg).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Motor deficit (left leg)**: Indicates damage to the **corticospinal tract**, which decussates in the medulla. A left-sided lesion affects the ipsilateral motor function.  
- **Ipsilateral dorsal column dysfunction (vibration/light touch loss on the left)**: Localizes to the **posterior cord** on the left side.  
- **Contralateral spinothalamic deficit (pain/temperature loss on the right)**: Results from disruption of the **spinothalamic tract**, which crosses at the spinal cord level. A left-sided lesion affects fibers carrying sensation from the right side.  
- **Lesion localization**: Combined ipsilateral motor/dorsal column deficits and contralateral spinothalamic deficits align with **spinal cord hemisection** (Brown-Séquard syndrome).  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Anterior cord lesion**: Causes bilateral spinothalamic and corticospinal deficits but spares dorsal columns. **Contradicted** by preserved dorsal column function on the right.  
2. **Posterior cord lesion**: Affects only vibration/light touch ipsilaterally. **Contradicted** by the presence of motor and spinothalamic deficits.  
3. **Right cord hemisection**: Would cause right motor deficits and left spinothalamic deficits. **Contradicted** by the patient’s left-sided motor weakness.  
4. **Left cord hemisection**: Explains left motor/dorsal column deficits and right spinothalamic deficits. **Strongly supported** by the clinical triad.  
5. **Complete cord transection**: Causes bilateral motor/sensory loss. **Contradicted** by unilateral deficits.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Left cord hemisection)(左侧脊髓半切损伤)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Ipsilateral corticospinal (left motor weakness) and dorsal column (left vibration/light touch loss) deficits.  
  - Contralateral spinothalamic tract involvement (right pain/temperature loss).  
  - Classic presentation of **Brown-Séquard syndrome** due to left spinal cord hemisection.
