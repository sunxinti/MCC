Case_description: 
A 16-year-old female presents to her primary care physician due to lack of menstruation. She has never had a period and is anxious that she is not “keeping up” with her friends. She states that her breasts began developing when she was 13, and she had a growth spurt around the same time. Review of systems reveals that she has also been getting headaches every few months over the last year with some photosensitivity and nausea each time. Ibuprofen relieves her symptoms. The patient is a competitive ice skater and has never been sexually active. Her mother has a history of migraine headaches, and her older sister has a history of bipolar disorder. Both underwent menarche at age 15. At this visit, the patient’s temperature is 98.6°F (37.0°C), pulse is 70/min, blood pressure is 118/65 mmHg, and respirations are 13/min. Her body mass index is 23.8 kg/m^2. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal exams are unremarkable. Both breasts are Tanner IV with no expressable discharge. Pelvic and axillary hair growth is also Tanner IV. The patient is unable to tolerate a full pelvic exam, but the part of the vaginal canal that is examined is unremarkable. Laboratory studies are ordered and are below:

Serum:
Na+: 139 mEq/L
K+: 4.1 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
HCO3-: 24 mEq/L
Urea nitrogen: 12 mg/dL
Glucose: 73 mg/dL
Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
Ca2+: 9.7 mg/dL
Mg2+: 1.7 mEq/L
AST: 11 U/L
ALT: 11 U/L
Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH): 16.2 mIU/mL (4.7-21.5 mIU/ml)
Estrogen: 240 pg/mL (64-357 pg/mL)

Abdominal ultrasound is performed and shows a normal uterus and ovaries. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options: 
1. Hypothalamic amenorrhea
2. Hyperprolactinemia
3. Imperforate hymen
4. Vaginal septum

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** A 16-year-old female competitive ice skater.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Primary amenorrhea (never had a menstrual period).  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**
  - **Pubertal Development:** Breast development started at 13 years with a growth spurt; currently Tanner IV for breasts, pelvic, and axillary hair.
  - **Additional Symptoms:** Intermittent headaches with photosensitivity and nausea, relieved by ibuprofen.
  - **Family History:** Mother with migraine headaches; older sister with bipolar disorder. Both mother and sister had menarche at age 15.
  - **Physical Examination:** Normal vital signs, BMI of 23.8 kg/m², unremarkable cardiopulmonary and abdominal exams, normal pelvic examination.
  - **Laboratory Results:** Normal electrolyte levels, renal function, liver enzymes, and hormone levels (FSH and estrogen within normal ranges).
  - **Imaging:** Abdominal ultrasound revealing a normal uterus and ovaries.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Primary Amenorrhea:** Defined as the absence of menarche by age 15 in the presence of secondary sexual characteristics or by age 13 without them. This patient is 16 with Tanner IV development, fitting the definition and warranting further evaluation.
- **Pubertal Development:** Normal breast and pubic hair development suggest adequate estrogen levels and normal gonadal function. Normal FSH and estrogen levels support this.
- **Headaches:** While she experiences headaches, they are consistent with migraines, especially given the family history, and are unlikely directly related to amenorrhea.
- **Family History of Menarche:** Both mother and sister had menarche at age 15, indicating a familial pattern of later menarche. This suggests that her primary amenorrhea may be a variant of normal development.
- **Absence of Other Signs:** No signs of hormonal imbalance, structural abnormalities, or systemic illness that would typically be associated with forms of amenorrhea such as hypothalamic dysfunction or anatomical obstructions.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**

1. **Hypothalamic Amenorrhea:**  
   - **Support:** Can be seen in athletes due to energy deficiency or stress.  
   - **Oppose:** Normal BMI, normal FSH, and estrogen levels make this unlikely.

2. **Hyperprolactinemia:**  
   - **Support:** Can cause amenorrhea.  
   - **Oppose:** Absence of galactorrhea, normal estrogen and FSH levels do not support this diagnosis.

3. **Imperforate Hymen:**  
   - **Support:** Presents with primary amenorrhea.  
   - **Oppose:** Ultrasound shows a normal uterus and ovaries without signs of hematocolpos; part of vaginal canal examined was unremarkable.

4. **Vaginal Septum:**  
   - **Support:** Can cause primary amenorrhea.  
   - **Oppose:** Lack of physical findings or ultrasound evidence supporting a vaginal obstruction.

5. **Normal Development:**  
   - **Support:** Family history of later menarche suggests a hereditary pattern. The patient has normal pubertal development and hormone levels.  
   - **Oppose:** Primary amenorrhea is beyond the typical age threshold, but familial patterns can extend the normal range.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 5 (Normal development)(正常发育)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 5 (Normal development)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 16-year-old female with primary amenorrhea (no menstruation since puberty began).  
- Secondary sexual characteristics: Breast and pubic hair Tanner IV, developed at age 13.  
- Key symptoms: Recurrent headaches (every few months) with photosensitivity, nausea, and relief with ibuprofen.  
- Family history: Mother has migraines; sister has bipolar disorder. Both relatives underwent menarche at age 15.  
- Labs: Normal FSH (16.2 mIU/mL) and estrogen (240 pg/mL), normal abdominal ultrasound (uterus/ovaries).  
- Notably absent findings: No pelvic pain, cyclic symptoms, or abnormal pelvic exam findings (except partial exam tolerance).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline**: Breast development began at 13, growth spurt at same time, but menarche delayed by 1 year (family history at 15). This is within normal variation (menarche typically occurs 2–3 years after breast development).  
- **Headaches**: Migraine-like symptoms (photosensitivity, nausea) align with maternal history of migraines. No vision changes or endocrine symptoms (e.g., galactorrhea) suggest no pituitary pathology.  
- **Lab Results**: Normal FSH and estrogen levels indicate intact hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, opposing diagnoses like hypothalamic amenorrhea (which often presents with low FSH early or high FSH if persistent). Normal ultrasound rules out structural anomalies (e.g., imperforate hymen, vaginal septum).  
- **Pelvic Findings**: Normal vaginal canal on partial exam and absence of cyclic pain or mass argue against obstructive lesions (imperforate hymen, vaginal septum).  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Hypothalamic amenorrhea**: Unlikely. While she is an athlete, her BMI (23.8) is normal, and FSH is within range (not suppressed or elevated). Stress or exercise-induced hypothalamic dysfunction typically causes low FSH early but may progress to elevated FSH if prolonged. Her normal FSH and estrogen suggest functional ovarian activity.  
2. **Hyperprolactinemia**: No prolactin level provided, but absence of galactorrhea or visual changes makes this less likely. Normal FSH (not suppressed) further opposes this.  
3. **Imperforate hymen**: Would typically present with cyclic pain, pelvic mass, or backflow of menstrual blood. Since she has never menstruated, this might be possible, but the normal ultrasound and lack of pain or mass make it unlikely. A partial exam might have missed a hymenal membrane, but her Tanner IV pubic hair suggests descent of the hymen.  
4. **Vaginal septum**: Similar to imperforate hymen, but would likely cause menstrual outflow issues. Since she has never menstruated, this is less likely. Ultrasound findings are normal.  
5. **Normal development**: Most consistent with the data. Delayed menarche (1 year past family history) with normal labs, Tanner stage IV, and normal anatomy fits normal variation. Headaches are migraines, unrelated to amenorrhea.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 5 (Normal development)(正常发育)**  

**Key evidence supporting this choice**:  
- Normal FSH and estrogen levels indicate functional ovarian activity.  
- Tanner IV breast and pubic hair development with no anatomical abnormalities on ultrasound confirm normal pubertal progression.  
- Delayed menarche (1 year past family history) is within normal variation.  
- Headaches are migraines, explained by family history and lack of endocrine/pituitary findings.  
- Absence of red flags (pain, pelvic mass, hormonal abnormalities) rules out structural or endocrine causes.

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 5 (Normal development)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 16-year-old female with primary amenorrhea, normal BMI (23.8 kg/m²), and Tanner IV breast/pubic/axillary hair development.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Absence of menstruation despite normal pubertal progression (breast development at age 13, growth spurt).  
- **Key Findings**:  
  - Normal FSH (16.2 mIU/mL) and estrogen (240 pg/mL).  
  - Normal uterus/ovaries on ultrasound.  
  - No anatomical abnormalities detected on partial pelvic exam.  
  - Migraine-like headaches (family history of migraines).  
  - No evidence of underweight, hyperprolactinemia (no galactorrhea), or obstructive symptoms (e.g., cyclic pain).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline**: Breast development at 13 aligns with normal puberty. Menarche typically occurs within 2–3 years of breast development (up to age 16), consistent with her current age.  
- **Supporting Normal Development**:  
  - Tanner IV secondary sexual characteristics indicate adequate estrogen exposure.  
  - Normal uterine/ovarian anatomy on ultrasound.  
  - Hormonal levels (FSH, estrogen) within normal ranges.  
- **Against Pathologic Causes**:  
  - **Hypothalamic amenorrhea**: Unlikely due to normal BMI, no energy deficit, and normal estrogen.  
  - **Hyperprolactinemia**: No galactorrhea; FSH/estrogen levels unaffected.  
  - **Imperforate hymen/vaginal septum**: Absence of hematocolpos on ultrasound or cyclic pain argues against obstruction.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Hypothalamic amenorrhea**: Excluded due to normal BMI, hormonal levels, and absence of stressors.  
2. **Hyperprolactinemia**: Unlikely without galactorrhea or hormonal derangements (prolactin not tested but FSH/estrogen normal).  
3. **Imperforate hymen**: No evidence of outflow obstruction (normal ultrasound, no pain/hematocolpos).  
4. **Vaginal septum**: Similar reasoning as imperforate hymen; partial exam and imaging do not suggest obstruction.  
5. **Normal development**: Most consistent with findings. Menarche can occur up to age 16 in patients with later breast development (13 years + 3-year window). Family history (menarche at 15) supports constitutional delay.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 5 (Normal development) (正常发育)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Normal hormonal profile (FSH, estrogen) and anatomy.  
  - Tanner IV development aligns with impending menarche.  
  - Family history of later menarche (age 15) supports constitutional delay.  
  - Absence of pathologic findings (e.g., obstruction, hormonal dysfunction).
