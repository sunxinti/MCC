**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**

- **Patient Information:** 58-year-old white male with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
- **Chief Complaint:** 3-month history of a painless lesion on the lower lip.
- **Clinical Manifestations:**
  - Single ulcer located near the vermillion border of the lower lip.
  - Significant smoking history (1 pack/day for 20 years).
  - Occupational exposure as a fruit picker for 25 years, likely indicating prolonged sun exposure.
  - No reported pain associated with the lesion.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**

- **Duration and Nature of Lesion:** The lesion has been present for 3 months and is painless, suggesting a chronic process rather than an acute infection.
- **Location:** The vermillion border is a common site for lip malignancies due to sun exposure.
- **Risk Factors:**
  - **Smoking:** A major risk factor for oral squamous cell carcinoma.
  - **Sun Exposure:** Chronic UV exposure, especially relevant for someone working outdoors for 25 years.
  - **Chronic Diseases:** Diabetes may contribute to impaired healing and increased susceptibility to malignancies.
- **Absence of Pain:** Painless ulcers are more concerning for malignant processes compared to painful ulcers, which are often benign or infectious in nature.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**

1. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma (Option 1):**
   - **Alignment with Clinical Presentation:** High. Chronic, painless ulcer in a high-risk area with significant risk factors (smoking, UV exposure).
   - **Supporting Evidence:** Persistent lesion, risk factors, location.
   - **Opposing Factors:** None significant; aligns well with presentation.

2. **Herpes Labialis (Option 2):**
   - **Alignment with Clinical Presentation:** Low. Typically presents as acute, painful vesicles or ulcers with recurrent episodes.
   - **Supporting Evidence:** None; lack of acute symptoms and recurrence.
   - **Opposing Factors:** Painlessness and chronicity oppose this diagnosis.

3. **Aphthous Stomatitis (Option 3):**
   - **Alignment with Clinical Presentation:** Low. Usually presents as multiple painful ulcers, often recurrent.
   - **Supporting Evidence:** None; single, painless ulcer is atypical.
   - **Opposing Factors:** Painlessness and lack of recurrence oppose this diagnosis.

4. **Actinic Keratosis (Option 4):**
   - **Alignment with Clinical Presentation:** Moderate. Pre-cancerous lesions related to sun exposure but typically present as scaly patches rather than ulcers.
   - **Supporting Evidence:** Sun exposure history.
   - **Opposing Factors:** Presentation as an ulcer is atypical; more common on skin rather than mucosal surfaces like the vermillion border.

5. **Traumatic Ulcer (Option 5):**
   - **Alignment with Clinical Presentation:** Low to Moderate. Typically associated with a clear history of trauma.
   - **Supporting Evidence:** Single ulcer could be traumatic.
   - **Opposing Factors:** Absence of trauma history and chronicity make this less likely.

**4. Final Selection**

**My final selection is: Option 1 (Squamous cell carcinoma) 鱗狀細胞癌**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 1 (Squamous cell carcinoma)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 58-year-old white male with hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and a 20-year smoking history presents with a **3-month history of a painless ulcer on the lower lip** near the vermillion border.  
- Key clinical features:  
  - **Persistent ulcer (3 months)**, which is non-healing.  
  - **Painless** nature.  
  - **Lip location** (vermillion border), a common site for lip cancer.  
  - Occupational history of prolonged sun exposure (fruit picker for 25 years).  

---

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Duration and persistence**: A 3-month ulcer strongly suggests a chronic or malignant process. Benign ulcers (e.g., aphthous stomatitis) typically resolve within 1–2 weeks.  
- **Painlessness**: Malignant ulcers (e.g., squamous cell carcinoma) are often painless, unlike infectious ulcers (e.g., herpes labialis, which are painful).  
- **Anatomical location**: The vermillion border of the lower lip is a high-risk area for **squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)** due to chronic sun exposure.  
- **Risk factors**:  
  - **Smoking**: A known risk factor for head and neck cancers.  
  - **Diabetes**: Impaired wound healing may contribute to non-healing ulcers.  
  - **Sun exposure**: Occupational history of sun exposure (fruit picker) increases SCC risk.  

---

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)**:  
   - **Likelihood**: High.  
   - **Supporting features**:  
     - Painless ulcer, long duration (3 months), and location on the lower lip (sun-exposed area).  
     - Strong association with smoking and chronic sun exposure.  
     - Diabetes may delay healing, masking signs of malignancy.  
   - **Clinical guidelines**: SCC of the lip is a well-documented malignancy linked to UV exposure and smoking.  

2. **Herpes labialis**:  
   - **Likelihood**: Low.  
   - **Opposing features**:  
     - Typically presents with grouped vesicles, not ulcers.  
     - Shorter duration (1–2 weeks) and painful.  

3. **Aphthous stomatitis**:  
   - **Likelihood**: Low.  
   - **Opposing features**:  
     - Usually painful, self-limiting (1–2 weeks), and recurrent.  
     - Unlikely to persist for 3 months.  

4. **Actinic keratosis**:  
   - **Likelihood**: Moderate.  
   - **Supporting features**:  
     - Sun-exposed lip.  
     - May precede SCC but typically presents as a scaly, hyperkeratotic plaque, not an ulcer.  

5. **Traumatic ulcer**:  
   - **Likelihood**: Low.  
   - **Opposing features**:  
     - Requires a clear mechanical cause (e.g., tooth trauma), which is not mentioned.  
     - Would resolve once the trauma is removed.  

---

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1 Squamous cell carcinoma (鳞状细胞癌)**  

**Key evidence supporting this choice**:  
- **Persistent non-healing ulcer** (3 months) in a high-risk area (lower lip vermillion border).  
- **Strong risk factors** (smoking, chronic sun exposure, diabetes).  
- **Painlessness**, which is more consistent with malignancy than benign or infectious causes.

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 1 (Squamous cell carcinoma)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Profile**: 58-year-old white man with hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, 20-pack-year smoking history, and prolonged sun exposure (fruit picker for 25 years).  
- **Chief Complaint**: Painless lower lip ulcer persisting for 3 months.  
- **Key Clinical Features**:  
  - Single, painless ulcer near the vermillion border.  
  - Chronicity (3-month duration) and lack of healing.  
  - Significant risk factors: smoking, chronic sun exposure.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Chronic Painless Ulcer**: A non-healing ulcer over months raises suspicion for malignancy. Painless nature distinguishes it from inflammatory or infectious causes (e.g., herpes or aphthous ulcers).  
- **Risk Factors**:  
  - **Smoking**: Strongly linked to oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).  
  - **Sun Exposure**: The vermillion border is a sun-exposed site, increasing risk for actinic damage and SCC.  
  - **Age**: Higher prevalence of malignancies in older adults.  
- **Exclusion of Acute/Recurrent Causes**: Herpes labialis and aphthous stomatitis are typically painful and recurrent/resolve within weeks. Traumatic ulcers require a history of injury and heal rapidly.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)**:  
   - **Alignment**: Chronic, painless ulcer in a high-risk patient (smoker, sun exposure) strongly supports SCC. The vermillion border is a common site for sun-related SCC.  
   - **Guidelines**: The American Cancer Society highlights non-healing oral ulcers as a red flag for malignancy.  

2. **Herpes Labialis**:  
   - **Contradictions**: Presents as painful, recurrent vesicles/ulcers resolving in 1–2 weeks. Painless, persistent ulcer excludes this.  

3. **Aphthous Stomatitis**:  
   - **Contradictions**: Painful, shallow ulcers on non-keratinized mucosa (e.g., inner lip). Location and painless nature rule this out.  

4. **Actinic Keratosis**:  
   - **Contradictions**: Presents as rough, scaly patches, not ulcerated. May precede SCC but does not match the ulcerative lesion described.  

5. **Traumatic Ulcer**:  
   - **Contradictions**: Requires a history of trauma and typically heals within weeks. Chronicity and absence of trauma history make this unlikely.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1 (Squamous cell carcinoma) (鳞状细胞癌)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Chronic, painless ulcer in a sun-exposed area.  
  - High-risk profile (smoking, occupational sun exposure).  
  - Exclusion of infectious, inflammatory, and traumatic etiologies.
