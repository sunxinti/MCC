Case_description: 
A 58-year-old woman comes to the physician because of intermittent painful retrosternal dullness for 4 weeks. The pain is recurrent and occurs when she exerts herself or when she is outside during cold weather. She also experiences shortness of breath and palpitations during these episodes. The symptoms resolve spontaneously when she stops or sits down for a while. Over the past few days, the episodes have increased in frequency. She has hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and osteoarthritis. Her left leg was amputated below the knee after a motorcycle accident 25 years ago. She is currently waiting for a new prosthesis and walks with crutches. Current medications include captopril, glyburide, and ibuprofen. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Her pulse is 88/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 144/90 mm Hg. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray of the chest shows no abnormalities. An ECG shows a normal sinus rhythm without any signs of ischemia. Serum cardiac markers are within the reference range. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?
Options: 
1. Myocardial perfusion scan under pharmacological stress
2. Upper endoscopy
3. Coronary angiography
4. Echocardiography at rest
5. Repeat ECG under treadmill stress

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Basic Information:** 58-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, osteoarthritis, and left leg amputation below the knee.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Intermittent painful retrosternal dullness for 4 weeks.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - Pain is recurrent, occurs with exertion or exposure to cold weather.  
  - Associated symptoms include shortness of breath and palpitations during episodes.  
  - Episodes resolve spontaneously upon rest or sitting.  
  - Recent increase in frequency of episodes.  
- **Vital Signs and Investigations:**  
  - Pulse: 88/min, Respirations: 20/min, Blood Pressure: 144/90 mm Hg.  
  - Cardiac examination: No abnormalities.  
  - Chest X-ray: No abnormalities.  
  - ECG: Normal sinus rhythm without signs of ischemia.  
  - Serum cardiac markers: Within reference range.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Pain Characteristics:** Retrosternal dull pain precipitated by exertion and cold exposure, relieved by rest, suggesting angina pectoris.  
- **Associated Symptoms:** Shortness of breath and palpitations align with myocardial ischemia.  
- **Risk Factors:** Hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus are significant risk factors for coronary artery disease.  
- **Negative Findings:** Normal ECG and cardiac markers reduce the immediate likelihood of acute myocardial infarction but do not rule out stable ischemic heart disease.  
- **Functional Status:** Osteoarthritis and use of crutches may limit the ability to perform physical stress tests like treadmill ECG.  
- **Recent Changes:** Increase in frequency of episodes may indicate worsening ischemia or progression to unstable angina.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Myocardial perfusion scan under pharmacological stress**  
  - **Alignment:** Suitable for patients unable to perform physical stress due to musculoskeletal limitations.  
  - **Support:** Provides functional information about myocardial ischemia.  
  - **Guidelines:** Recommended for ischemia evaluation when exercise testing is impractical.  
- **Option 2: Upper endoscopy**  
  - **Alignment:** Less likely as symptoms are more suggestive of cardiac rather than gastrointestinal origin.  
  - **Support:** Not indicated based on current presentation.  
- **Option 3: Coronary angiography**  
  - **Alignment:** Invasive; typically reserved for cases with high-risk features or after non-invasive testing suggests significant disease.  
  - **Support:** Not first-line without prior non-invasive evidence of ischemia.  
- **Option 4: Echocardiography at rest**  
  - **Alignment:** May identify structural heart disease but less useful for diagnosing ischemia without stress.  
  - **Support:** Limited utility in this clinical scenario.  
- **Option 5: Repeat ECG under treadmill stress**  
  - **Alignment:** Standard for ischemia evaluation but may be limited by the patient's ability to perform treadmill exercise due to osteoarthritis and use of crutches.  
  - **Support:** May not be feasible or provide accurate results given the patient's physical limitations.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1 (Myocardial perfusion scan under pharmacological stress)(药物负荷下的心肌灌注扫描)**

Qwen is reasoning the answer...

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 1 (Myocardial perfusion scan under pharmacological stress)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 58-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and below-knee amputation presents with **intermittent retrosternal pain** over 4 weeks.  
- **Key symptoms**: Pain occurs with exertion or exposure to cold weather, resolves with rest, and is accompanied by **shortness of breath and palpitations** during episodes.  
- **Significant features**: Symptoms are angina-like (exertional, positional trigger, relieved by rest), and she has risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Angina-like pain**: Retrosternal discomfort triggered by exertion and cold exposure (vasoconstriction may exacerbate coronary insufficiency) strongly suggests myocardial ischemia.  
- **Shortness of breath and palpitations** during episodes further support cardiac etiology.  
- **Normal resting ECG and cardiac markers** indicate no acute myocardial infarction but do not rule out chronic ischemia.  
- **Risk factors**: Hypertension, diabetes, and age increase CAD likelihood.  
- **Limitations**: Mobility issues (crutches) preclude effective treadmill stress testing.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (Myocardial perfusion scan under pharmacological stress)**:  
  - **Likely the best choice**. Pharmacological stress imaging is indicated for suspected CAD when exercise is not feasible. It evaluates myocardial perfusion and detects ischemia.  
  - Aligns with angina-like symptoms, risk factors, and inability to perform exercise.  
- **Option 2 (Upper endoscopy)**:  
  - Unlikely. Retrosternal pain from esophageal causes (e.g., GERD, esophagitis) typically lacks exertional or cold triggers and is worsened by eating/lying down. No dysphagia or heartburn reported.  
- **Option 3 (Coronary angiography)**:  
  - Invasive and reserved for confirmed ischemia or high-risk scenarios. Non-invasive testing (e.g., stress imaging) is first-line to avoid unnecessary angiography.  
- **Option 4 (Echocardiography at rest)**:  
  - Unlikely. Resting echo cannot assess stress-induced ischemia. Useful only if wall motion abnormalities are suspected at rest (not indicated here).  
- **Option 5 (Repeat ECG under treadmill stress)**:  
  - Not feasible due to patient’s mobility limitations (crutches, recent amputation). Stress ECG requires adequate exertion.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1 (Myocardial perfusion scan under pharmacological stress)(药物应激心肌灌注扫描)**  

**Key evidence**:  
- Classic angina-like symptoms (exertional, positional trigger, relief with rest) with risk factors for CAD.  
- Normal resting ECG and cardiac markers necessitate stress testing to evaluate for occult ischemia.  
- Pharmacological stress imaging (e.g., nuclear perfusion scan) is the optimal non-invasive test for patients unable to exercise.

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 1 (Myocardial perfusion scan under pharmacological stress)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Profile**: 58-year-old woman with hypertension, type 2 diabetes, osteoarthritis, and a below-knee amputation.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Intermittent retrosternal dullness for 4 weeks, triggered by exertion or cold exposure, resolving with rest.  
- **Key Symptoms**: Exertional/cold-induced chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations. Symptoms have increased in frequency recently.  
- **Critical Findings**: Normal ECG, chest X-ray, and cardiac markers. Inability to perform treadmill exercise due to amputation.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Symptom Characteristics**:  
  - **Typical Angina Features**: Exertional/cold-triggered pain, rest relief, associated dyspnea/palpitations.  
  - **Escalating Frequency**: Suggests possible progression to unstable angina.  
- **Risk Factors**: Hypertension, diabetes (major CAD risk factors).  
- **Contradictory Findings**: Normal ECG and cardiac markers rule out acute ischemia/infarction but do not exclude chronic CAD.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (Myocardial Perfusion Scan under Pharmacological Stress)**:  
  - **Alignment**: Ideal for evaluating ischemia in patients unable to exercise. Pharmacological stress (e.g., adenosine) mimics exercise-induced stress.  
  - **Guidelines**: Recommended as first-line non-invasive testing for CAD in high-risk patients with contraindications to exercise stress.  
- **Option 2 (Upper Endoscopy)**:  
  - **Misalignment**: Exertional symptoms and lack of GI-specific features (e.g., burning, acid reflux) make GERD/gastritis less likely.  
- **Option 3 (Coronary Angiography)**:  
  - **Consideration**: Gold standard for CAD but typically reserved after non-invasive testing or high-risk unstable angina. Premature without stress test evidence.  
- **Option 4 (Rest Echocardiography)**:  
  - **Limitation**: Unlikely to detect ischemia at rest; useful for structural evaluation but insufficient for exertional symptom assessment.  
- **Option 5 (Repeat ECG under Treadmill Stress)**:  
  - **Contraindication**: Patient’s amputation and crutch use preclude treadmill exercise.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1 (Myocardial perfusion scan under pharmacological stress)(药物负荷心肌灌注扫描)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  1. High pre-test probability of CAD due to typical angina symptoms, diabetes, and hypertension.  
  2. Inability to perform exercise stress necessitates pharmacological stress testing.  
  3. Normal resting ECG and markers do not exclude ischemia, necessitating functional assessment.  
  4. Guidelines prioritize non-invasive ischemia evaluation before invasive angiography.
