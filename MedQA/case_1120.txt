**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**
- **Patient Information:** 24-year-old woman.
- **Chief Complaint:** Concern about a recent pregnancy; desires medical abortion.
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**
  - Missed menstrual period two weeks ago.
  - Positive over-the-counter pregnancy tests confirming pregnancy.
  - Emotional distress and decision-making for abortion at approximately 6 weeks of gestation.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**
- **Timeline:** Intercourse occurred a few weeks ago, with a missed menstrual period detected two weeks prior to the visit, suggesting an early pregnancy (~6 weeks gestational age).
- **Characteristics:**
  - Confirmation of pregnancy via over-the-counter tests.
  - Emotional response consistent with early pregnancy decision-making.
- **Interrelationships:**
  - Early gestational age (6 weeks) is within the appropriate window for medical abortion.
  - Patient’s choice aligns with available medical protocols for first-trimester abortion.
- **Supporting Features for Diagnosis:**
  - Gestational age suitable for medical abortion.
  - Patient’s informed decision after counseling.
- **Opposing Features:**
  - No signs of ectopic pregnancy or contraindications mentioned.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**
- **Option 1: Megestrol**
  - **Use:** Primarily used as an appetite stimulant in cancer and AIDS patients; not indicated for abortion.
  - **Alignment:** Does not align with the need for medical abortion.
- **Option 2: Tamoxifen**
  - **Use:** Selective estrogen receptor modulator used in breast cancer treatment; not indicated for abortion.
  - **Alignment:** Irrelevant to the patient's needs.
- **Option 3: Terbutaline**
  - **Use:** β2-adrenergic agonist used for tocolysis in preterm labor; not indicated for abortion.
  - **Alignment:** Does not align with the requirement for medical abortion.
- **Option 4: Mifepristone**
  - **Use:** Antiprogestin used in combination with misoprostol for medical abortion up to 10 weeks of gestation.
  - **Alignment:** Directly aligns with the patient’s request for a medical abortion at 6 weeks.
- **Option 5: Copper intrauterine device**
  - **Use:** Primarily used for long-term contraception and emergency contraception; not used for abortion.
  - **Alignment:** Not suitable for terminating an established pregnancy.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Mifepristone)(穆非孕酮)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 4 (Mifepristone)

Qwen's full response:

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 24-year-old woman presents with confirmed pregnancy at 6 weeks following her first sexual intercourse. Key symptoms include a missed menstrual period and positive over-the-counter pregnancy tests. She is emotionally distressed and has decided to pursue medical abortion.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline**: Intercourse occurred 6 weeks prior to presentation, with a missed menstrual period at 2 weeks. Pregnancy tests confirmed the pregnancy.  
- **Clinical Presentation**: The patient’s chief concern is termination of the pregnancy, which is within the timeframe where medical abortion is a viable option (typically up to 10 weeks’ gestation).  
- **Key Features**: The gestational age (6 weeks) and patient’s decision for medical abortion align with protocols for medication-based termination.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Megestrol**  
  - A progestin used for luteal phase support or to treat progesterone-deficient pregnancies. It does not terminate pregnancy and would be contraindicated here.  

- **Option 2: Tamoxifen**  
  - An anti-estrogen agent used primarily in breast cancer treatment or ovulation induction. It has no role in pregnancy termination.  

- **Option 3: Terbutaline**  
  - A β₂-agonist used to suppress preterm labor. It would actively counteract abortion by inhibiting uterine contractions.  

- **Option 4: Mifepristone**  
  - A progesterone receptor antagonist that blocks the hormone progesterone, essential for maintaining pregnancy. It is the cornerstone of medical abortion regimens, typically followed by misoprostol to induce uterine contractions. This aligns perfectly with the patient’s gestational age and clinical scenario.  

- **Option 5: Copper intrauterine device (IUD)**  
  - Used for emergency contraception (up to 5 days post-intercourse) or long-term contraception. It is not indicated for terminating an established intrauterine pregnancy confirmed by a positive pregnancy test.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 Mifepristone (Mifepristone)(米非司酮)**

DeepSeek is reasoning the answer...

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 4 (Mifepristone)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient:** 24-year-old woman with a confirmed 6-week pregnancy via over-the-counter tests.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Desire for medical abortion after missing a menstrual period and confirming pregnancy.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:** Emotional distress (tearfulness) and a clear intention to terminate the pregnancy after counseling.  
- **Decisive Factors:** Confirmed intrauterine pregnancy at 6 weeks gestation, patient’s informed decision for medical abortion.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline:** Unprotected intercourse → missed period → positive pregnancy tests → decision for abortion at 6 weeks.  
- **Characteristics:** The patient is within the gestational window for medical abortion (≤10 weeks in most guidelines). No contraindications (e.g., ectopic pregnancy) are mentioned.  
- **Interrelationships:** Confirmed pregnancy and patient autonomy align with eligibility for medical abortion.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Megestrol (甲地孕酮):** A synthetic progestin used for contraception or cancer treatment. **Opposes** abortion, as progestins maintain pregnancy.  
2. **Tamoxifen (他莫昔芬):** A selective estrogen receptor modulator for breast cancer. No role in abortion. **Irrelevant**.  
3. **Terbutaline (特布他林):** A β2-agonist to relax uterine muscles (e.g., preterm labor). **Opposes** abortion by inhibiting contractions.  
4. **Mifepristone (米非司酮):** Progesterone receptor antagonist. Blocks progesterone, causing endometrial breakdown and cervical softening. **Supports** medical abortion (first-line with misoprostol per WHO guidelines).  
5. **Copper IUD (铜宫内节育器):** Emergency contraception if inserted post-coitus. **Contraindicated** after confirmed pregnancy.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Mifepristone)(米非司酮)**  
- **Key Evidence:**  
  - Mifepristone is the gold-standard first drug in medical abortion protocols for pregnancies ≤10 weeks.  
  - It blocks progesterone receptors, inducing pregnancy detachment, and is followed by misoprostol for expulsion.  
  - All other options are either contraindicated (e.g., Copper IUD), irrelevant (Tamoxifen), or oppose abortion (Megestrol, Terbutaline).
