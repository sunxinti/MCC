**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** 23-year-old woman.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Mood concerns characterized by persistent tiredness and lack of motivation.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - **Psychological Symptoms:** Anhedonia (no longer finds happiness in previously enjoyed activities).  
  - **Physical Symptoms:** Heavy limbs, significant effort required to perform activities.  
  - **Sleep Disturbances:** Struggles to sleep, occasionally unable to sleep for several days.  
- **Clinical Context:** Initiated on first-line therapy for her symptoms and returned after one week with no improvement, reporting impaired performance at work and school.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Symptom Duration and Onset:** Acute presentation with symptoms consistent with a depressive episode. The short duration of one week since initiating therapy suggests an early phase of treatment.  
- **Severity of Symptoms:** The patient's symptoms are significantly impacting her daily functioning, including work and academic performance. The presence of severe sleep disturbances (insomnia for several days) may indicate a higher severity of depression.  
- **Interrelationship of Symptoms:** The combination of anhedonia, fatigue, psychomotor slowing (heavy limbs), and sleep disturbances are hallmark features of major depressive disorder (MDD). The lack of response after one week is within the expected timeframe for antidepressant efficacy, as these medications typically require several weeks to exhibit therapeutic effects.  
- **Supporting Features for Diagnosis:** The clinical presentation aligns with MDD, and there are no evident signs pointing towards bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, or other psychiatric conditions. The absence of manic or hypomanic episodes makes bipolar disorder less likely.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Add lithium to treatment regimen**  
  - **Analysis:** Lithium is primarily used as a mood stabilizer in bipolar disorder or as an augmenting agent in treatment-resistant MDD. Given that this is the initial phase of treatment for what appears to be unipolar depression, adding lithium is premature.  
  - **Likelihood:** Low. Not aligned with first-line management for initial treatment of MDD.

- **Option 2: Change treatment to duloxetine**  
  - **Analysis:** Duloxetine is an SNRI used as a first-line treatment for MDD. However, switching antidepressants after only one week is generally not recommended, as most antidepressants require 4-6 weeks to assess efficacy.  
  - **Likelihood:** Low. Premature change of therapy without adequate trial duration.

- **Option 3: Change treatment to lithium**  
  - **Analysis:** Lithium is not a first-line monotherapy for unipolar depression and is typically reserved for bipolar disorder or as an adjunct in treatment-resistant cases.  
  - **Likelihood:** Very Low. Inappropriate as a primary treatment for MDD.

- **Option 4: Continue current therapy**  
  - **Analysis:** Antidepressants typically require several weeks to manifest clinical improvement. Continuing the current first-line therapy while monitoring the patient's progress is in line with clinical guidelines. Supportive measures and close follow-up can be beneficial.  
  - **Likelihood:** High. Aligns with standard treatment protocols for MDD.

- **Option 5: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)**  
  - **Analysis:** ECT is reserved for severe, treatment-resistant depression, or when a rapid therapeutic response is necessary (e.g., risk of suicide, catatonia). This patient has only been on therapy for one week, making ECT an excessive intervention at this stage.  
  - **Likelihood:** Very Low. Not justified given the current treatment duration and absence of life-threatening symptoms.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Continue current therapy)(继续当前治疗)**

Qwen is reasoning the answer...

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 4 (Continue current therapy)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 23-year-old woman presents with persistent fatigue, anhedonia (loss of pleasure in previously enjoyed activities), psychomotor retardation (limbs feeling heavy), and severe insomnia.  
- Symptoms have led to significant impairment in work and school performance.  
- She was started on first-line therapy, but after 1 week, there is no improvement.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- The symptoms (anhedonia, fatigue, psychomotor retardation, insomnia) strongly align with a major depressive episode.  
- The timeline is critical: antidepressants typically require **2–4 weeks** to demonstrate efficacy. A 1-week trial is insufficient to conclude treatment failure.  
- The patient’s request for help due to functional decline suggests urgency, but this does not override the need for adequate treatment duration.  
- Psychomotor retardation and insomnia are hallmark features of melancholic depression, which may respond better to specific treatments (e.g., SNRIs or augmentation strategies). However, the timing of the assessment is premature.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (Add lithium):** Lithium is an augmenting agent for treatment-resistant depression but is typically added after **4–6 weeks of inadequate response** to first-line therapy. The 1-week trial is too short for this step.  
- **Option 2 (Change to duloxetine):** Duloxetine (SNRI) may be effective, but switching antidepressants too early risks suboptimal outcomes. A 1-week trial is insufficient to justify switching.  
- **Option 3 (Change to lithium):** Lithium is not first-line for unipolar depression and requires a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, which is not indicated here.  
- **Option 4 (Continue current therapy):** Antidepressants require time to work. Continuing therapy for **2–4 more weeks** aligns with standard practice and avoids premature intervention.  
- **Option 5 (Electroconvulsive therapy):** Reserved for severe, life-threatening cases with imminent risk (e.g., psychosis, catatonia). The patient’s symptoms, while impairing, do not meet this threshold.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Continue current therapy)(继续当前疗法)**  
- Key evidence: Antidepressants require **2–4 weeks** for efficacy. A 1-week trial is insufficient to determine treatment failure. Continuing therapy allows adequate time for response while avoiding unnecessary intervention. The patient’s functional decline does not yet justify escalating to ECT or switching/augmenting therapy so early.

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 23-year-old woman.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Mood concerns, fatigue, anhedonia, and severe insomnia.  
- **Key Symptoms**:  
  - Persistent fatigue and "heavy limbs."  
  - Anhedonia (loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities).  
  - Severe insomnia (episodes of no sleep for several days).  
  - No improvement after 1 week of first-line therapy.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Symptom Characteristics**:  
  - Symptoms align with **major depressive disorder (MDD)**: anhedonia, fatigue, and sleep disturbances.  
  - Severe insomnia (prolonged sleeplessness) suggests significant impairment.  
- **Timeline**:  
  - Symptoms are chronic (exact duration unspecified) but acutely worsening.  
  - Lack of improvement after 1 week of first-line therapy (likely an SSRI/SNRI).  
- **Key Considerations**:  
  - Antidepressants typically require **4–6 weeks** for full effect.  
  - Early non-response (1 week) does not indicate treatment failure.  
  - Severe insomnia and functional impairment suggest urgency but not immediate life-threatening risk (e.g., suicidality, catatonia).  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (Add lithium)**: Lithium augmentation is reserved for **treatment-resistant depression (TRD)** after **≥4 weeks** of inadequate response. Premature at 1 week.  
- **Option 2 (Change to duloxetine)**: Switching antidepressants is premature without adequate trial. Guidelines recommend waiting 4–6 weeks unless intolerable side effects occur.  
- **Option 3 (Change to lithium)**: Lithium monotherapy is not standard for MDD. It is used as augmentation or for bipolar disorder, which is not indicated here.  
- **Option 4 (Continue current therapy)**: Most appropriate. Insufficient time has passed for therapeutic effect. Monitoring and supportive care are indicated.  
- **Option 5 (Electroconvulsive therapy)**: Reserved for severe, refractory cases or emergencies (e.g., psychosis, suicidality). Not yet justified here.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Continue current therapy)(继续当前治疗)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - First-line antidepressants require **4–6 weeks** for efficacy.  
  - No red flags (e.g., suicidality, psychosis) to justify aggressive interventions.  
  - Premature changes (augmentation, switching, or ECT) deviate from clinical guidelines for uncomplicated MDD.
