Case_description: 
A 45-year-old G5P4105 presents to her gynecologist’s office with six months of increasingly heavy periods. She now soaks one super absorbent tampon every two hours for five days each cycle. Her cycles have also become irregular, with intermenstrual bleeding for the last two months. She now experiences significant dysmenorrhea, requiring 400 mg ibuprofen every four hours for the majority of each menses. In addition, she reports new onset mild dyspareunia with intercourse and a “heavy feeling” in her pelvis. She has also noticed increased urinary frequency but denies bowel changes. The patient has a past medical history of obesity and type II diabetes on metformin. Her last child was born four years ago, and she has had five spontaneous vaginal deliveries. At this office visit, temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 137/84 mmHg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 14/min. Which of the following physical exam findings is most likely to be present in this patient?
Options: 
1. Rectouterine septum nodularity
2. Globular 10-week sized uterus
3. Adnexal mass
4. Irregular 14-week sized uterus
5. No remarkable physical exam finding

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** 45-year-old female, G5P4105, with a history of obesity and type II diabetes managed with metformin. She has had five spontaneous vaginal deliveries, with her last childbirth occurring four years ago.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Six months of increasingly heavy menstrual periods.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - **Menstrual Changes:** Soaks one super absorbent tampon every two hours for five days each cycle, irregular cycles, and intermenstrual bleeding for the past two months.  
  - **Pain Symptoms:** Significant dysmenorrhea requiring frequent ibuprofen use and new-onset mild dyspareunia.  
  - **Pelvic Symptoms:** A "heavy feeling" in the pelvis and increased urinary frequency without bowel changes.  
  - **Vital Signs:** Slightly elevated blood pressure (137/84 mmHg) with other parameters within normal limits.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Menorrhagia and Irregular Bleeding:** Suggestive of structural uterine abnormalities such as leiomyomas (fibroids) or adenomyosis, or possibly endometrial hyperplasia. The addition of intermenstrual bleeding raises concern for endometrial pathology.  
- **Dysmenorrhea and Dyspareunia:** These symptoms indicate possible uterine pathology affecting pelvic structures, such as fibroids causing anatomical distortion or adenomyosis leading to uterine enlargement and pain.  
- **Pelvic Heavy Feeling and Urinary Frequency:** These pressure symptoms are consistent with an enlarged uterus or pelvic mass impinging on the bladder.  
- **Patient’s Obstetric History:** Multiple pregnancies and deliveries increase the risk of uterine fibroids.  
- **Absence of Bowel Changes:** Helps in differentiating from masses affecting the bowel, making adnexal masses less likely.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**

1. **Rectouterine Septum Nodularity:**  
   - **Likelihood:** Low. Typically associated with congenital uterine anomalies or post-surgical scarring, neither of which are suggested in the patient's history.
   
2. **Globular 10-week Sized Uterus:**  
   - **Likelihood:** Possible but less likely. A globular enlarged uterus is more characteristic of adenomyosis, which presents with diffuse uterine enlargement and pain but may not account for the irregularity in uterine size or shape suggested by the patient's symptoms.

3. **Adnexal Mass:**  
   - **Likelihood:** Low. Adnexal masses are usually associated with ovarian tumors or cysts, which might present with different symptomatology such as acute pain or more localized findings on physical exam.

4. **Irregular 14-week Sized Uterus:**  
   - **Likelihood:** High. An irregularly enlarged uterus is highly suggestive of uterine fibroids (leiomyomas), which align with the patient's heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pressure symptoms, dysmenorrhea, and dyspareunia. Fibroids can cause the uterus to become irregularly enlarged and palpable on physical examination.

5. **No Remarkable Physical Exam Finding:**  
   - **Likelihood:** Unlikely. Given the severity of symptoms and the duration, it is probable that a physical exam would reveal an abnormality such as an enlarged or irregular uterus.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Irregular 14-week sized uterus) (不规则的14周大小子宫)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 4 (Irregular 14-week sized uterus)

Qwen's full response:

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 45-year-old multiparous woman (G5P4105) presents with 6 months of progressively worsening menorrhagia (soaking one super absorbent tampon every 2 hours), irregular cycles, intermenstrual bleeding, severe dysmenorrhea requiring NSAIDs, dyspareunia, and pelvic heaviness.  
- Key symptoms: Menorrhagia, intermenstrual bleeding, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and pelvic pressure.  
- Decisive signs: Heavy menstrual bleeding with a "heavy feeling" and bulk symptoms (dyspareunia, urinary frequency), suggesting uterine enlargement.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Menorrhagia and cycle irregularity**: Suggests structural (e.g., fibroids, adenomyosis) or hormonal etiologies. The prolonged and worsening symptoms over 6 months favor a structural cause.  
- **Dysmenorrhea**: Could indicate endometriosis or fibroids. NSAID dependence is common in fibroids due to prostaglandin-mediated pain.  
- **Dyspareunia and pelvic heaviness**: Point to bulk symptoms, which are characteristic of uterine enlargement (e.g., fibroids or adenomyosis).  
- **Urinary frequency**: Likely due to uterine compression from an enlarged uterus.  
- **Risk factors**: Obesity and multiparity are risk factors for uterine fibroids.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (Rectouterine septum nodularity)**: Associated with endometriosis or congenital anomalies. While endometriosis can cause dyspareunia and dysmenorrhea, the bulk symptoms and menorrhagia are more consistent with uterine enlargement rather than nodularity.  
- **Option 2 (Globular 10-week sized uterus)**: A globular uterus could indicate early pregnancy or adenomyosis. However, the size (10 weeks) is smaller than expected for a patient with significant bulk symptoms. Uterine fibroids typically cause an irregularly enlarged uterus.  
- **Option 3 (Adnexal mass)**: Adnexal masses (e.g., ovarian cysts, endometriomas) may explain dyspareunia but not the predominant uterine bulk symptoms and menorrhagia.  
- **Option 4 (Irregular 14-week sized uterus)**: Uterine fibroids are the most common cause of uterine enlargement and bulk symptoms. The irregular contour and size (14 weeks) align with multiparity and fibroid growth. This is the most consistent finding with her symptoms.  
- **Option 5 (No remarkable finding)**: Unlikely, as the clinical presentation strongly suggests a physical abnormality.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Irregular 14-week sized uterus)(不规则14周大小的子宫)**  

**Key Evidence**:  
- Uterine fibroids are the leading cause of menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, and bulk symptoms (dyspareunia, pelvic pressure, urinary frequency) in multiparous women.  
- An irregularly enlarged uterus (14-week size) is a classic physical exam finding in fibroids.  
- The patient’s obesity and parity are risk factors for fibroid development.  
- Other options (e.g., adnexal mass, nodularity) do not fully explain the constellation of symptoms or the bulk-related findings.

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Profile**: 45-year-old G5P4105 woman with obesity and type II diabetes.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Six months of progressively heavy menstrual bleeding (soaking one super tampon every 2 hours), irregular cycles with intermenstrual bleeding, severe dysmenorrhea (requiring high-dose ibuprofen), new-onset dyspareunia, pelvic "heavy feeling," and urinary frequency.  
- **Key Clinical Features**: Menorrhagia, irregular bleeding, dysmenorrhea, pelvic pressure, urinary frequency, and absence of bowel symptoms.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Menorrhagia & Irregular Bleeding**: Suggests structural uterine pathology (e.g., fibroids, adenomyosis) or hormonal dysregulation. Intermenstrual bleeding raises concern for fibroids or endometrial pathology.  
- **Dysmenorrhea & Dyspareunia**: Severe pain aligns with adenomyosis or fibroids causing uterine enlargement/pressure.  
- **Pelvic "Heavy Feeling" & Urinary Frequency**: Indicates a mass effect, likely from an enlarged uterus compressing the bladder.  
- **Timeline**: Progressive symptoms over six months with recent intermenstrual bleeding favor fibroids or adenomyosis.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (Rectouterine Septum Nodularity)**: Typical of deep infiltrating endometriosis, but lacks supporting symptoms (e.g., cyclic bowel pain). Unlikely.  
- **Option 2 (Globular 10-Week Uterus)**: Characteristic of adenomyosis (diffuse uterine enlargement). However, intermenstrual bleeding is less common in isolated adenomyosis.  
- **Option 3 (Adnexal Mass)**: Suggests ovarian pathology (e.g., endometrioma, cyst), but symptoms are predominantly uterine. Unlikely.  
- **Option 4 (Irregular 14-Week Uterus)**: Strongly supports uterine fibroids (leiomyomas), which cause irregular enlargement, menorrhagia, intermenstrual bleeding, and mass effects (urinary frequency, pelvic pressure). Size (14-week) aligns with severe symptoms.  
- **Option 5 (No Remarkable Findings)**: Contradicted by clear symptoms of structural pathology (e.g., palpable uterine enlargement).  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Irregular 14-week sized uterus)(不规则的14周大小子宫)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  1. **Irregular Uterine Enlargement**: Fibroids cause asymmetric uterine growth, consistent with a "heavy feeling" and urinary frequency.  
  2. **Menorrhagia & Intermenstrual Bleeding**: Submucosal fibroids disrupt the endometrial lining, leading to heavy/prolonged bleeding.  
  3. **Clinical Correlation**: Fibroids are prevalent in perimenopausal women and strongly associated with the described symptoms. A 14-week size explains significant mass effects.
