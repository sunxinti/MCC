**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**
- **Patient Information:** A 77-year-old man presents for a routine medical visit.
- **Chief Complaint:** Recent appearance of several brown, greasy-looking lesions on his forehead.
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:** Lesions are brown and have a greasy appearance; the patient is unable to peel them off.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**
- **Age and Demographics:** The patient is elderly, which is relevant as certain skin conditions are more prevalent in older populations.
- **Lesion Characteristics:** Multiple brown lesions that are greasy and cannot be peeled off suggest a benign, keratinized skin growth.
- **Location:** Forehead is a common site for seborrheic keratosis due to higher sebaceous gland activity.
- **Onset and Progression:** Recent appearance indicates an acquired rather than congenital condition.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**
1. **Melanoma:**
   - **Alignment with Presentation:** Melanomas are typically singular, irregularly shaped, and may exhibit color variation. The presence of multiple greasy lesions is less characteristic.
   - **Supporting Features:** Brown coloration could suggest melanoma, but the ability to peel off and multiple lesions oppose this diagnosis.
   
2. **Seborrheic Keratosis:**
   - **Alignment with Presentation:** Common in older adults, presents as multiple, well-defined, brown or black, waxy, and often greasy lesions that are adherent to the skin.
   - **Supporting Features:** Difficulty in peeling off and location on the forehead align well with seborrheic keratosis.
   
3. **Keloid:**
   - **Alignment with Presentation:** Keloids are overgrowths of scar tissue that develop after skin injury, usually raised and firm. They are not typically multiple, brown, or greasy.
   - **Supporting Features:** Lack of trauma history and lesion characteristics make keloid unlikely.
   
4. **Acanthosis Nigricans:**
   - **Alignment with Presentation:** Characterized by dark, velvety discoloration in skin folds, not as discrete greasy lesions. More associated with insulin resistance or malignancies.
   - **Supporting Features:** The presentation does not match the typical presentation of acanthosis nigricans.
   
5. **Erythema Nodosum:**
   - **Alignment with Presentation:** Presents as tender red nodules, usually on the shins, not as brown greasy lesions on the forehead.
   - **Supporting Features:** Location and appearance are inconsistent with erythema nodosum.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Seborrheic keratosis)(脂溢性角化症)**

Choice: Option 2 (Seborrheic keratosis)

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 77-year-old man presents with new, asymptomatic brown, greasy-appearing lesions on his forehead that he cannot peel off.  
- Key symptoms include the appearance of lesions described as "brown" and "greasy," with a non-peelable texture. These features suggest a benign epidermal lesion rather than an inflammatory or malignant process.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Appearance**: The "greasy" or "waxy" texture and brown color are classic for seborrheic keratoses, which often have a "pasted-on" or verrucous surface. The inability to peel them off supports this, as seborrheic keratoses are adherent to the skin.  
- **Age and Location**: Seborrheic keratoses are common in older adults and typically occur on sun-exposed areas like the face and trunk, aligning with the forehead location.  
- **Timeline**: The gradual appearance of multiple lesions is consistent with seborrheic keratoses, which often develop slowly and may increase in number over time.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **1. Melanoma**: Unlikely due to the lack of asymmetry, irregular borders, color variation, or elevation typical of melanoma. Melanoma would also not present as "greasy" and non-peelable.  
- **2. Seborrheic keratosis**: Highly likely. The greasy, stuck-on appearance, age, and location are all classic features. These lesions are benign and common in the elderly.  
- **3. Keloid**: Unlikely, as keloids are raised, firm, and erythematous scars that result from tissue trauma, not spontaneous brown lesions on the forehead.  
- **4. Acanthosis nigricans**: Unlikely. This condition causes velvety, hyperpigmented skin in body folds (e.g., neck, axillae), not greasy lesions on the forehead. It is also associated with insulin resistance or malignancy, which the case does not suggest.  
- **5. Erythema nodosum**: Excluded by the clinical presentation. This condition causes tender, erythematous nodules on the shins, not flat/brown forehead lesions.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Seborrheic keratosis)(脂溢性角化病)**  
- **Key evidence**: The "greasy," non-peelable, brown lesions on the forehead of an elderly patient are hallmark features of seborrheic keratoses. These lesions are benign, common in older adults, and align perfectly with the described appearance and clinical context. Other diagnoses are inconsistent with the presentation.

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 77-year-old man.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Recent appearance of multiple brown, greasy lesions on the forehead that cannot be peeled off (as shown in figure A).  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations**:  
  - Lesions are brown, greasy, and adherent (non-peelable).  
  - Asymptomatic (no pain, itching, or systemic symptoms reported).  
  - Localized to the forehead.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Lesion Characteristics**:  
  - **Color/Texture**: Brown and greasy/waxy, consistent with hyperkeratotic growth.  
  - **Adherence**: Inability to peel off suggests a firmly attached epidermal lesion.  
  - **Distribution**: Multiple lesions on sun-exposed areas (forehead).  
- **Timeline**: Recent onset in an elderly patient aligns with benign age-related skin changes.  
- **Supporting/Opposing Features**:  
  - **Supports Seborrheic Keratosis**: Classic "stuck-on" appearance, greasy texture, and occurrence in older adults.  
  - **Opposes Melanoma**: Absence of asymmetry, irregular borders, color variegation, or rapid growth.  
  - **Opposes Keloid**: No history of trauma/scarring; keloids are typically firm and localized to injury sites.  
  - **Opposes Acanthosis Nigricans**: Lack of velvety texture and atypical location (forehead vs. body folds).  
  - **Opposes Erythema Nodosum**: No erythema, tenderness, or nodularity; inconsistent location (shins typical).  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Melanoma**: Unlikely. Melanoma typically exhibits ABCDE criteria (Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Color variation, Diameter >6mm, Evolution). The greasy, adherent nature and multiplicity of lesions are atypical.  
2. **Seborrheic Keratosis**: **Most Likely**. Strongly supported by age, greasy/stuck-on appearance, and asymptomatic nature. Common in elderly and often involves sun-exposed areas.  
3. **Keloid**: Unlikely. Keloids are firm, rubbery scars from prior trauma; no history provided, and lesions lack characteristic texture.  
4. **Acanthosis Nigricans**: Unlikely. Presents as hyperpigmented, velvety plaques in flexural areas (neck, axillae), associated with metabolic disorders.  
5. **Erythema Nodosum**: Ruled out. Presents as tender, erythematous nodules on shins, often with systemic symptoms.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Seborrheic keratosis) (脂溢性角化病)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Classic presentation of multiple brown, greasy, adherent lesions in an elderly patient.  
  - Absence of malignant features (e.g., asymmetry, ulceration, rapid growth).  
  - Alignment with the benign, age-related nature of seborrheic keratosis.
