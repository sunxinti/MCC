**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** A 72-year-old woman.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Unstable angina.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - Diagnosed with unstable angina, a condition characterized by unpredictable chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart.  
  - Cardiac catheterization revealed a 50% reduction in the diameter of the left circumflex artery, indicating significant arterial narrowing which compromises myocardial perfusion.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline and Characteristics:**  
  - The patient’s presentation with unstable angina suggests an acute or subacute process, likely due to atherosclerotic plaque destabilization leading to partial arterial occlusion.  
  - A 50% reduction in vessel diameter is substantial enough to affect hemodynamics but may not cause complete ischemia, aligning with the instability of her angina symptoms.  
- **Interrelationships:**  
  - The degree of arterial narrowing directly influences the resistance to blood flow, which in turn affects myocardial oxygen supply.  
  - According to Poiseuille’s law, resistance is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the vessel's radius, meaning even a modest reduction in diameter can significantly increase resistance.  
- **Supporting Features:**  
  - The increase in resistance due to vessel narrowing is consistent with the pathophysiology of unstable angina, where compromised blood flow leads to ischemic symptoms.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Understanding Resistance Increase:**  
  - Poiseuille’s law: \( R \propto \frac{1}{r^4} \), where \( R \) is resistance and \( r \) is the radius of the vessel.  
  - A 50% reduction in diameter implies a 50% reduction in radius.  
  - Calculating the factor increase:  
    \[ \frac{R_1}{R_0} = \left(\frac{1}{0.5}\right)^4 = 16 \]
- **Evaluating Diagnostic Options:**  
  1. **64:** This would correspond to an 75% reduction in diameter, which is not the case here.  
  2. **16:** Accurately represents a 50% reduction in diameter based on Poiseuille’s law.  
  3. **8:** Corresponds to approximately a 29.3% reduction in diameter.  
  4. **4:** Corresponds to a 37.5% reduction in diameter.  
  5. **32:** Lies between reductions of 60% and 65%, which exceeds the current scenario.  
- **Alignment with Clinical Presentation:**  
  - Only Option 2 (16) correctly quantifies the increase in resistance due to a 50% reduction in diameter, making it the most clinically accurate choice based on the provided data.

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 2 (16)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 72-year-old woman with unstable angina undergoes cardiac catheterization, revealing a 50% diameter reduction in the left circumflex artery.  
- Key symptom is unstable angina, indicating myocardial ischemia due to reduced coronary blood flow.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- The critical clinical feature is the **50% reduction in diameter** of the left circumflex artery.  
- Unstable angina suggests insufficient coronary blood flow to meet myocardial demand, which is directly influenced by vascular resistance.  
- Poiseuille’s Law governs blood flow resistance: \( R \propto \frac{1}{r^4} \), where \( r \) is the vessel radius.  
- A 50% reduction in diameter implies the radius is halved (\( r_{\text{new}} = 0.5 \times r_{\text{original}} \)).  
- Resistance increases by \( \left(\frac{1}{0.5}\right)^4 = 16 \)-fold.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (64):** Incorrect. This would require a 75% reduction in radius (e.g., \( r_{\text{new}} = 0.25 \times r_{\text{original}} \)), which is not the case here.  
- **Option 2 (16):** Correct. A 50% diameter reduction halves the radius, leading to a \( 16 \)-fold increase in resistance (\( 1/(0.5)^4 = 16 \)).  
- **Option 3 (8):** Incorrect. This would occur if the radius were reduced to \( \sqrt[4]{8} \times r \), which does not align with the given diameter reduction.  
- **Option 4 (4):** Incorrect. A 4-fold increase would require a \( \sqrt[4]{4} \)-fold radius reduction (e.g., \( r_{\text{new}} \approx 0.7 \times r_{\text{original}} \)), inconsistent with the case.  
- **Option 5 (32):** Incorrect. This would necessitate a greater radius reduction (e.g., 25% diameter remaining), which is not described.

**My final selection is: Option 2 (16) (16)**

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 2 (16)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 72-year-old woman admitted for unstable angina.  
- **Key Finding**: Cardiac catheterization reveals a **50% reduction in the diameter** of the left circumflex artery.  
- **Critical Question**: Factor by which resistance to blood flow has increased compared to an unoccluded vessel.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Hemodynamic Principle**: Resistance (R) in a blood vessel is governed by **Poiseuille's Law**: \( R \propto 1/r^4 \), where \( r \) is the vessel radius.  
- **Diameter Reduction**: A 50% reduction in diameter equates to a **50% reduction in radius** (since radius = diameter/2).  
- **Impact on Resistance**: Halving the radius increases resistance by \( (1/0.5)^4 = 16 \)-fold.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (64)**: Incorrect. This would require a radius reduction to 1/4 of the original (not 50%).  
- **Option 2 (16)**: Correct. Matches the \( (1/0.5)^4 = 16 \) calculation for a 50% radius reduction.  
- **Option 3 (8)** and **Option 4 (4)**: Incorrect. Underestimate the fourth-power relationship.  
- **Option 5 (32)**: Incorrect. Overestimates the effect.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (16)(16倍)**  
- **Key Evidence**: Poiseuille's Law dictates that resistance increases with the **fourth power of radius reduction**. A 50% diameter (and radius) reduction elevates resistance by \( 2^4 = 16 \)-fold.
