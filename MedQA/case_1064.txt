Case_description: 
A 22-year-old woman presents with recurrent episodes of swelling in her face, hands, and neck with occasional abdominal pain. The symptoms usually resolve in 2 to 3 days. She has had these swelling events her whole life; however, they have become more debilitating recently. Last week she had an event that restricted her ability to eat and swallow.  Past medical history is noncontributory. Her father is alive and well with no significant medical history. Her mother and her maternal aunt have a similar condition. Today, her physical exam is within normal limits. She brought a picture of her swollen hand as seen in the picture. The treating physician has a strong suspicion of an inherited disorder. C1-inhibitor levels are ordered and found to be extremely low. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis of this patient?
Options: 
1. DiGeorge syndrome
2. Chediak-Higashi syndrome
3. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome
4. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria
5. Hereditary angioedema
Correct Answer: Hereditary angioedema

GPT's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** A 22-year-old woman.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Recurrent episodes of swelling in the face, hands, and neck, accompanied by occasional abdominal pain.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - Swelling episodes have been lifelong but have recently become more severe.
  - Episodes typically resolve within 2 to 3 days.
  - Recent episode last week impaired her ability to eat and swallow.
  - Family history significant for similar conditions in her mother and maternal aunt.
  - Current physical examination is normal.
  - Laboratory finding: Extremely low C1-inhibitor levels.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Recurrent Swelling (Angioedema):** The patient's recurrent swelling episodes in the extremities and face are indicative of angioedema. The involvement of the neck and potential airway compromise during recent episodes raises concern for hereditary angioedema.
- **Abdominal Pain:** Abdominal attacks are common in hereditary angioedema due to swelling of the intestinal wall, leading to pain, nausea, and vomiting.
- **Family History:** The presence of similar symptoms in the mother and maternal aunt suggests an inherited pattern, which is consistent with hereditary angioedema, an autosomal dominant disorder.
- **C1-Inhibitor Levels:** Extremely low levels of C1-inhibitor are a hallmark of hereditary angioedema type I, the most common form of the condition.
- **Normal Physical Exam Between Episodes:** This aligns with hereditary angioedema, where patients are usually asymptomatic between attacks.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: DiGeorge syndrome**  
  - *Unlikely.* DiGeorge is characterized by cardiac anomalies, hypocalcemia, and immune deficiencies, none of which are present in this patient.
  
- **Option 2: Chediak-Higashi syndrome**  
  - *Unlikely.* This syndrome involves partial albinism, recurrent infections, and neurological deficits, which do not align with the patient's symptoms.
  
- **Option 3: Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome**  
  - *Unlikely.* This syndrome presents with thrombocytopenia, eczema, and immunodeficiency, which are not features of the current case.
  
- **Option 4: Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria**  
  - *Unlikely.* This condition is characterized by hemolytic anemia, hemoglobinuria, and thrombosis, none of which are indicated in this patient.
  
- **Option 5: Hereditary angioedema**  
  - *Highly Likely.* The patient's recurrent angioedema, family history, and extremely low C1-inhibitor levels strongly support this diagnosis.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 5 Hereditary angioedema (遗传性血管性水肿)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 5 (Hereditary angioedema)

Qwen's full response:

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
A 22-year-old woman presents with lifelong recurrent episodes of swelling in the face, hands, and neck, along with occasional abdominal pain. Symptoms resolve spontaneously in 2–3 days but have become increasingly debilitating. A recent episode caused difficulty eating and swallowing. Family history reveals similar conditions in her mother and maternal aunt. Current physical exam is normal, but C1-inhibitor levels are extremely low.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Recurrent angioedema**: Episodes of localized swelling without urticaria (hives) are hallmark features of hereditary angioedema (HAE). The involvement of the face, extremities, and oropharynx (impacting swallowing) aligns with HAE’s typical presentation.  
- **Abdominal pain**: Likely due to intestinal wall swelling, a common manifestation in HAE, mimicking acute abdomen.  
- **Familial pattern**: Autosomal dominant inheritance is consistent with HAE, as the patient’s mother and aunt are affected.  
- **C1-inhibitor deficiency**: Extremely low levels confirm a key diagnostic criterion for HAE Type I, which is caused by defective synthesis of C1-inhibitor.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **DiGeorge syndrome**: Associated with congenital hypoparathyroidism, cardiac defects, and immunodeficiency. Angioedema and C1-inhibitor deficiency are not features. **Unlikely**.  
2. **Chediak-Higashi syndrome**: Characterized by partial albinism, immunodeficiency, and neurologic abnormalities. No association with angioedema or C1-inhibitor deficiency. **Unlikely**.  
3. **Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome**: Presents with eczema, thrombocytopenia, and immunodeficiency. Angioedema is not a feature. **Unlikely**.  
4. **Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)**: Causes hemolytic anemia and thrombosis due to complement-mediated injury. Angioedema and low C1-inhibitor are not part of its pathology. **Unlikely**.  
5. **Hereditary angioedema (HAE)**: Matches all key features: recurrent angioedema without urticaria, familial inheritance, C1-inhibitor deficiency, and visceral organ involvement (abdominal pain, laryngeal swelling). **Most likely**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 5 (Hereditary angioedema)(遗传性血管性水肿)**

DeepSeek's full response:

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Profile**: 22-year-old woman with lifelong recurrent episodes of facial, hand, and neck swelling, accompanied by occasional abdominal pain. Symptoms resolve in 2–3 days but have worsened recently, causing dysphagia.  
- **Key Clinical Features**:  
  - Recurrent angioedema (face, hands, neck).  
  - Abdominal pain (likely due to gastrointestinal mucosal swelling).  
  - Positive family history (mother and maternal aunt with similar symptoms).  
  - Extremely low **C1-inhibitor levels**.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline and Symptom Characteristics**:  
  - Lifelong recurrent episodes of swelling, consistent with a **hereditary disorder**.  
  - Recent exacerbation with dysphagia highlights upper airway involvement, a critical risk in angioedema.  
  - Abdominal pain correlates with visceral edema, a common feature of angioedema.  
- **Supporting/Opposing Features**:  
  - **Low C1-inhibitor** strongly points to **hereditary angioedema (HAE)**.  
  - Absence of urticaria, infections, thrombocytopenia, or hemolytic anemia rules out other options (e.g., Chediak-Higashi, Wiskott-Aldrich, PNH).  
  - Family history aligns with autosomal dominant inheritance (HAE type I/II).  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **DiGeorge syndrome**: Presents with congenital heart defects, hypocalcemia, and immune deficiency. No association with angioedema or low C1-inhibitor. **Excluded**.  
2. **Chediak-Higashi syndrome**: Features albinism, recurrent infections, and bleeding disorders. No link to episodic swelling. **Excluded**.  
3. **Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome**: X-linked disorder with thrombocytopenia, eczema, and immunodeficiency. Irrelevant to this case. **Excluded**.  
4. **Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)**: Causes hemolysis, thrombosis, and hemoglobinuria. No association with angioedema or C1-inhibitor deficiency. **Excluded**.  
5. **Hereditary angioedema (HAE)**:  
   - Matches all clinical features: recurrent angioedema, abdominal pain, family history.  
   - **Low C1-inhibitor** is pathognomonic for HAE type I.  
   - Autosomal dominant inheritance explains maternal lineage. **Strongly supported**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 5 (Hereditary angioedema)(遗传性血管性水肿)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Recurrent angioedema involving the face, extremities, and gastrointestinal tract.  
  - Positive family history in an autosomal dominant pattern.  
  - **Definitive lab confirmation**: Extremely low C1-inhibitor levels, diagnostic for HAE type I.
