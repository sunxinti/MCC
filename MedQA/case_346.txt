**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**
- **Patient Information:** 19-year-old male in a 3-month heterosexual relationship.
- **Chief Complaint:** Engages in frequent sexual fantasies about male coworkers.
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**
  - Internal conflict regarding sexual orientation.
  - Lives in a conservative community with no known openly gay men.
  - Recently joined a local hate group and participated in attacking a gay couple.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**
- **Timeline:** The patient’s internal conflicts appear to have culminated recently with joining a hate group and committing an aggressive act against a gay couple.
- **Characteristics:**
  - **Sexual Fantasies:** Indicative of same-sex attractions conflicting with his current heterosexual relationship.
  - **Conservative Environment:** Likely contributes to repression or denial of his sexual orientation.
  - **Joining Hate Group:** Suggests a manifestation of internalized negative feelings towards homosexuality.
  - **Aggressive Behavior:** Direct action against a gay couple mirrors his hidden conflicts.
- **Interrelationships:** The discrepancy between his private fantasies and public actions indicates a defensive response to internal conflict, aiming to suppress or deny his same-sex attractions.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**
- **Option 1: Acting out**
  - *Analysis:* Involves expressing unconscious emotions through actions rather than words. While his aggression may be seen as acting out, it doesn’t fully capture the transformation of his internal conflict.
- **Option 2: Sublimation**
  - *Analysis:* Channeling unacceptable impulses into socially acceptable activities. His actions are aggressive and socially condemned, opposite of sublimation.
- **Option 3: Reaction formation**
  - *Analysis:* Involves transforming unacceptable feelings into their opposites. His hidden same-sex attractions are outwardly expressed as hostility towards homosexual individuals, fitting this mechanism.
- **Option 4: Intellectualization**
  - *Analysis:* Using reasoning to avoid emotional stress. There’s no evidence of detachment from emotional aspects in his behavior.
- **Option 5: Projection**
  - *Analysis:* Attributing one’s own unacceptable feelings to others. While possible, his direct aggression suggests a more opposite behavioral response rather than mere attribution.

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 19-year-old male in a 3-month heterosexual relationship.  
- **Key Symptoms/Behaviors**:  
  - Frequent sexual fantasies about male coworkers.  
  - Joined a hate group and participated in an attack on a gay couple.  
  - Lives in a conservative community with no exposure to openly gay individuals.  
- **Decisive Features**:  
  - Internal conflict between repressed homosexual urges and externalized homophobic behavior.  
  - Aggressive actions toward a stigmatized group (gay individuals) despite personal attraction to the same gender.  

---

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline**:  
  - The patient’s sexual fantasies (3 months) predate his involvement with the hate group (recent).  
  - The attack occurred shortly after joining the hate group, suggesting a rapid escalation of externalized behavior.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - **Internal Conflict**: The patient experiences same-sex attractions but is in a heterosexual relationship and lives in a conservative environment.  
  - **Aggressive Behavior**: The attack on the gay couple aligns with the patient’s newfound affiliation with a hate group.  
  - **Social Context**: The conservative community and lack of exposure to openly gay individuals may amplify internalized homophobia.  
- **Interrelationships**:  
  - The patient’s repressed same-sex attractions may drive unconscious anxiety, leading to the adoption of extreme anti-LGBTQ+ behavior to suppress these feelings.  

---

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **1. Acting out**:  
  - **Definition**: Expressing unconscious impulses through destructive actions rather than verbalization.  
  - **Fit**: The attack could be seen as an impulsive “acting out” of repressed homosexual urges.  
  - **Weakness**: Does not fully explain the ideological alignment with a hate group or the deliberate targeting of gay individuals.  

- **2. Sublimation**:  
  - **Definition**: Redirecting unacceptable impulses into socially approved activities.  
  - **Fit**: Unlikely, as the attack is not a constructive activity but a harmful act.  

- **3. Reaction formation**:  
  - **Definition**: Adopting the opposite of one’s true feelings to mask them.  
  - **Fit**: Strongly supports the patient’s behavior. His unconscious homosexual attractions are suppressed, and he adopts extreme homophobic actions (attacking gay individuals) to counteract these feelings.  
  - **Strength**: Aligns with the internal conflict and the patient’s social environment.  

- **4. Intellectualization**:  
  - **Definition**: Detaching from emotions by focusing on logic.  
  - **Fit**: Unrelated, as the attack is an emotional, not intellectual, response.  

- **5. Projection**:  
  - **Definition**: Attributing one’s unacceptable traits to others.  
  - **Fit**: Less likely, as the behavior is directed against gay individuals rather than accusing others of his own feelings.  

---

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Reaction formation)(反向形成)**  

**Key Evidence**:  
- The patient’s internal conflict between repressed homosexual urges and externalized homophobic behavior strongly supports reaction formation.  
- Joining a hate group and attacking gay individuals represent an extreme manifestation of adopting the opposite stance to his true feelings, a hallmark of reaction formation.  
- The conservative social context further explains the suppression of his attractions and the need to conform to perceived societal norms.

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 3 (Reaction formation)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Profile**: 19-year-old male in a heterosexual relationship but experiencing frequent same-sex sexual fantasies.  
- **Key Symptoms/Behaviors**:  
  1. Persistent sexual fantasies about male coworkers despite being in a heterosexual relationship.  
  2. Membership in a hate group and participation in a violent attack against a gay couple.  
  3. Resides in a conservative community with no openly gay role models, suggesting internalized conflict about his own sexuality.  
- **Decisive Features**: Aggressive behavior targeting gay individuals contrasts starkly with his unresolved same-sex attractions, indicating a psychological conflict.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline and Interrelationships**:  
  - Sexual fantasies predate the violent act, suggesting long-standing internal conflict.  
  - Joining a hate group and attacking gay couples represents a sudden escalation of externalized hostility, temporally linked to unresolved internal struggles.  
- **Key Observations**:  
  - The **discrepancy** between his same-sex attractions and outward homophobic aggression is central.  
  - **Rejection of own desires**: His conservative environment likely stigmatizes homosexuality, creating shame/guilt. The attack serves to distance himself from his taboo urges.  
- **Features Against Other Diagnoses**:  
  - No evidence of channeling urges into socially acceptable actions (opposes *Sublimation*).  
  - No excessive rationalization or detachment (opposes *Intellectualization*).  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Acting out**: Involves impulsive actions to avoid emotional awareness. While his attack is impulsive, the targeted homophobia suggests a deeper conflict (not merely impulsivity).  
2. **Sublimation**: Absent; no constructive redirection of urges (e.g., art, activism).  
3. **Reaction formation**: Strong candidate. Overcompensation by adopting attitudes/behaviors *opposite* to true desires (e.g., homophobic violence masking same-sex attraction).  
4. **Intellectualization**: Unlikely; no focus on abstract reasoning to avoid emotions.  
5. **Projection**: Plausible alternative. Attributing his own unacceptable desires to others (e.g., attacking gay men for "having" the urges he denies in himself).  

**4. Final Selection**  
- **Reaction formation** best explains the **paradoxical aggression**: His violent homophobia serves to suppress/deny his own same-sex attractions. By attacking gay individuals, he symbolically "destroys" the part of himself he cannot accept, adhering to his community’s norms.  
- While *Projection* is relevant, the extremity of his behavior (joining a hate group, physical violence) aligns more with *Reaction formation*’s emphasis on **opposite behaviors** as overcompensation.
