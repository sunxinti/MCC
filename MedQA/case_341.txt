Case_description: 
A 28-year-old primigravid woman at 39 weeks gestation is admitted to the hospital in active labor. On examination, the cervix is 100% effaced and 10 cm dilated. After 5 minutes of pushing, there is a prolonged deceleration of the fetal heart rate to 90/min. A decision to perform an episiotomy is made to expedite vaginal delivery. The anesthesiologist locates the ischial spines by palpating the posterolateral vaginal sidewall and administers an anesthetic. Three minutes later, pinching the posterior vulva does not provoke pain. The anesthetized nerve most likely also supplies which of the following structures?
Options: 
1. Obturator externus muscle
2. Skin of the lateral thigh
3. External anal sphincter
4. Skin of the mons pubis
5. Detrusor muscle
Correct Answer: External anal sphincter

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**
- **Patient Information:** A 28-year-old primigravid woman at 39 weeks gestation.
- **Chief Complaint:** Admitted in active labor.
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**
  - Cervix is 100% effaced and 10 cm dilated, indicating full labor.
  - After 5 minutes of pushing, there is a prolonged deceleration of the fetal heart rate to 90/min, necessitating an urgent delivery.
  - A decision is made to perform an episiotomy to expedite vaginal delivery.
  - The anesthesiologist administers an anesthetic by locating the ischial spines via palpation of the posterolateral vaginal sidewall.
  - Three minutes post-anesthetic administration, pinching the posterior vulva does not provoke pain, indicating effective nerve blockade.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**
- **Timeline & Procedure:** The procedure involves administering a local anesthetic during an urgent episiotomy due to fetal distress.
- **Nerve Blockade Indication:** The absence of pain upon pinching the posterior vulva suggests effective blockade of the sensory nerves supplying that area.
- **Nerve Identification:** The location for anesthetic administration (ischial spines via the posterolateral vaginal sidewall) targets the pudendal nerve, which provides sensory and motor innervation to the perineal region.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**
- **Option 1: Obturator externus muscle**
  - **Analysis:** Supplied by the obturator nerve, which is unrelated to the pudendal nerve blockade. Unlikely to be affected.
- **Option 2: Skin of the lateral thigh**
  - **Analysis:** Innervated by the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, not by the pudendal nerve. Unlikely to be affected.
- **Option 3: External anal sphincter**
  - **Analysis:** Supplied by the pudendal nerve. Since the pudendal nerve is likely anesthetized, the external anal sphincter would also be affected.
- **Option 4: Skin of the mons pubis**
  - **Analysis:** Primarily innervated by the iliohypogastric and genitofemoral nerves. While there may be some overlap, it's less directly associated with the pudendal nerve.
- **Option 5: Detrusor muscle**
  - **Analysis:** Controlled by the autonomic nervous system (parasympathetic fibers from the pelvic splanchnic nerves), not the pudendal nerve. Unlikely to be affected.

**4. Final Selection**

**My final selection is: Option 3 (External anal sphincter)(外部肛门括约肌)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 3 (External anal sphincter)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 28-year-old primigravid woman at 39 weeks gestation presents in active labor with fully effaced and dilated cervix.  
- After 5 minutes of pushing, prolonged fetal heart rate deceleration to 90/min prompts an episiotomy.  
- An anesthetic is administered after locating the ischial spines via vaginal palpation.  
- Three minutes post-anesthesia, the posterior vulva is anesthetized (no pain with pinching).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Key Features**: The anesthetic was administered near the ischial spines, a landmark for identifying the pudendal nerve. The pudendal nerve is the primary nerve supplying the perineum and anal region.  
- **Timeline**: Immediate loss of pain sensation in the posterior vulva confirms successful block of the pudendal nerve.  
- **Interpretation**: The pudendal nerve is likely anesthetized, as its sensory branches supply the posterior vulva and surrounding structures.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Obturator externus muscle**  
  - Innervated by the obturator nerve (L2-L4), not the pudendal nerve.  
  - Unrelated to the anesthetic site. **Unlikely**.  

- **Option 2: Skin of the lateral thigh**  
  - Innervated by the femoral nerve (L2-L4) or lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (L2-L3).  
  - Not part of the pudendal nerve distribution. **Unlikely**.  

- **Option 3: External anal sphincter**  
  - Innervated by the pudendal nerve’s inferior anal branch.  
  - Directly supplied by the same nerve anesthetized in the case. **Highly Likely**.  

- **Option 4: Skin of the mons pubis**  
  - Innervated by the ilioinguinal nerve (L1) or genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve (L1-L2).  
  - Outside the pudendal nerve’s territory. **Unlikely**.  

- **Option 5: Detrusor muscle**  
  - Innervated by pelvic splanchnic nerves (S2-S4), which are parasympathetic.  
  - The pudendal nerve does not supply smooth muscle. **Unlikely**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (External anal sphincter)(外括约肌)**

DeepSeek is reasoning the answer...

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 3 (External anal sphincter)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Profile**: 28-year-old primigravid woman at 39 weeks gestation in active labor.  
- **Clinical Context**: Fully dilated (10 cm) and effaced cervix, prolonged fetal heart rate deceleration to 90/min during pushing, prompting episiotomy.  
- **Key Diagnostic Clue**: Anesthesia administered near the ischial spines resulted in absent pain sensation in the posterior vulva.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Landmark Identification**: The ischial spines are the anatomical target for **pudendal nerve block**, commonly used for perineal anesthesia during episiotomy.  
- **Nerve Involvement**: Loss of posterior vulvar sensation indicates successful blockade of the pudendal nerve (S2–S4), which provides sensory innervation to the posterior vulva and motor/sensory fibers to the perineum.  
- **Relevance to Options**: The pudendal nerve’s branches (inferior rectal, perineal) also innervate the external anal sphincter and perianal skin.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Obturator externus muscle**: Innervated by the obturator nerve (L2–L4), unrelated to pudendal nerve. **Eliminated**.  
2. **Skin of the lateral thigh**: Supplied by the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (L2–L3). **Eliminated**.  
3. **External anal sphincter**: Innervated by the pudendal nerve’s inferior rectal branch. **Strongly supported**.  
4. **Skin of the mons pubis**: Supplied by the ilioinguinal (L1) and genitofemoral (L1–L2) nerves. **Eliminated**.  
5. **Detrusor muscle**: Controlled by pelvic splanchnic nerves (parasympathetic S2–S4), distinct from pudendal nerve’s somatic fibers. **Eliminated**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (External anal sphincter)(肛门括约肌外)**  
- **Key Evidence**: The pudendal nerve (blocked in this case) provides motor innervation to the external anal sphincter via its inferior rectal branch. Loss of posterior vulvar sensation confirms pudendal nerve anesthesia, directly linking to its additional role in sphincter control.
