Case_description: 
A 26-year-old man comes to the physician for episodic fever, recurrent night sweats, and a 6-kg (14.2-lb) weight loss over the past 2 months. He reports that the fever lasts for 7 to 10 days, then subsides completely for about a week before returning again. His temperature is 39°C (102.2°F). Physical examination shows nontender cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. An x-ray of the chest shows bilateral mediastinal masses. Resection of a cervical lymph node is performed. A photomicrograph of the resected specimen is shown. Further histopathological examination is most likely to show which of the following findings?
Options: 
1. Cells staining positive for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase
2. Cells staining positive for CD15 and CD30
3. Cells with BCR-ABL rearrangement
4. Cells overexpressing Bcl-2
5. Cells with t(8;14) chromosomal translocation
Correct Answer: Cells staining positive for CD15 and CD30

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** 26-year-old man.  
- **Chief Complaints:** Episodic fever, recurrent night sweats, and a 6-kg (14.2-lb) weight loss over the past 2 months.  
- **Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - Fever episodes lasting 7 to 10 days, followed by approximately one week of complete remission before recurring.  
  - Physical examination reveals nontender cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.  
  - Chest X-ray shows bilateral mediastinal masses.  
- **Decisive Symptoms and Signs:**  
  - B symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss) suggesting a systemic process, often seen in malignancies like lymphoma.  
  - Presence of mediastinal masses in a young male strongly points towards specific types of lymphoma, particularly Hodgkin lymphoma.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline and Symptom Pattern:**  
  - The patient has experienced cyclical fevers lasting 7-10 days with intermittent remission periods, which is characteristic of certain lymphoproliferative disorders.  
  - Significant weight loss and night sweats (B symptoms) are classical indicators of malignancy, especially hematologic cancers.  
- **Physical Examination Findings:**  
  - Nontender lymphadenopathy typically suggests a chronic process such as lymphoma rather than acute infections, which often present with tender lymph nodes.  
- **Radiological Findings:**  
  - Bilateral mediastinal masses are highly suggestive of Hodgkin lymphoma, particularly the nodular sclerosing subtype, which is common in young adults and more prevalent in males.  
- **Interrelationship of Features:**  
  - The combination of systemic symptoms, lymphadenopathy, and mediastinal masses creates a clinical picture that narrows the differential diagnosis towards lymphomas, specifically Hodgkin lymphoma.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Cells staining positive for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)**  
  - **Associated Condition:** Hairy cell leukemia.  
  - **Relevance:** Typically presents in middle-aged males with splenomegaly, which is not consistent with the current clinical presentation.  
- **Option 2: Cells staining positive for CD15 and CD30**  
  - **Associated Condition:** Hodgkin lymphoma (specifically Reed-Sternberg cells).  
  - **Relevance:** Aligns perfectly with the patient's age, mediastinal masses, lymphadenopathy, and B symptoms.  
- **Option 3: Cells with BCR-ABL rearrangement**  
  - **Associated Condition:** Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).  
  - **Relevance:** Usually presents with different symptoms such as elevated white blood cell count and is less likely to present with mediastinal masses and B symptoms in this manner.  
- **Option 4: Cells overexpressing Bcl-2**  
  - **Associated Condition:** Follicular lymphoma and some other non-Hodgkin lymphomas.  
  - **Relevance:** While Bcl-2 is involved in lymphomas, the specific presentation with mediastinal masses in a young male is more indicative of Hodgkin lymphoma.  
- **Option 5: Cells with t(8;14) chromosomal translocation**  
  - **Associated Condition:** Burkitt lymphoma.  
  - **Relevance:** Typically presents with rapidly growing tumors in the abdomen, especially in pediatric populations, which does not match the current case.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Cells staining positive for CD15 and CD30) (CD15和CD30阳性的细胞)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 2 (Cells staining positive for CD15 and CD30)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 26-year-old male presents with episodic fever (7–10 days, then subsiding for a week), recurrent night sweats, and a 6-kg weight loss over 2 months.  
- Physical examination reveals nontender cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy and bilateral mediastinal masses on chest X-ray.  
- **Decisive features**: Periodic fever pattern, lymphadenopathy, mediastinal masses, and constitutional symptoms (B symptoms: fever, weight loss, night sweats).  

---

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Periodic fever**: The cyclical nature of fever (Pel-Ebstein pattern) is a hallmark of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL).  
- **Lymphadenopathy**: Nontender cervical and supraclavicular nodes are typical in cHL, which often involves the mediastinum (as seen on chest X-ray).  
- **Mediastinal masses**: Suggest involvement of lymph nodes in the central compartment, highly suggestive of Hodgkin lymphoma.  
- **Weight loss and night sweats**: Constitutional B symptoms are strongly associated with aggressive lymphomas, including cHL.  
- **Age and gender**: Young adult males are a common demographic for cHL.  

---

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) positivity**:  
   - Seen in hairy cell leukemia or Langerhans cell histiocytosis.  
   - **Does not align**: Mediastinal masses and lymphadenopathy are atypical for these disorders.  

2. **CD15 and CD30 positivity**:  
   - **Key markers for classical Hodgkin lymphoma**: Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells in cHL typically express CD15 (Wright staining) and CD30.  
   - **Perfectly aligns**: Matches the clinical presentation (B symptoms, periodic fever, mediastinal involvement).  

3. **BCR-ABL rearrangement**:  
   - Diagnoses chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).  
   - **Does not align**: CML presents with splenomegaly, leukocytosis, and constitutional symptoms but lacks lymphadenopathy or mediastinal masses.  

4. **Bcl-2 overexpression**:  
   - Seen in follicular lymphoma (t(14;18)).  
   - **Does not align**: Follicular lymphoma is typically indolent, lacks periodic fever, and mediastinal masses are less common.  

5. **t(8;14) translocation**:  
   - Diagnoses Burkitt lymphoma (encodes c-MYC relocation).  
   - **Does not align**: Burkitt lymphoma is highly aggressive, presents with rapidly enlarging masses (e.g., jaw, abdomen), and is rarely associated with periodic fever or mediastinal involvement.  

---

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Cells staining positive for CD15 and CD30)(细胞对CD15和CD30的染色呈阳性)**  

**Key evidence**:  
- The clinical presentation (periodic fever, mediastinal masses, B symptoms) strongly suggests classical Hodgkin lymphoma.  
- Reed-Sternberg cells, the pathognomonic cells of cHL, are defined by CD15 and CD30 positivity.  
- Other options are inconsistent with the lymphadenopathy pattern, fever periodicity, and anatomical involvement described.
