Case_description: 
A 29-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 24 weeks' gestation comes to the emergency department because of vaginal bleeding and mild pelvic pain for 2 hours. Her current pregnancy was achieved by means of in vitro fertilization due to azoospermia in her partner. Prenatal course has been uncomplicated with regular prenatal visits. After a period of having avoided sexual intercourse during her early pregnancy, she resumed sexual activity with her partner at week 22 of gestation. Her first child was delivered by lower segment transverse cesarean section because of a nonreassuring fetal heart rate; her other child was delivered vaginally. She has had abnormal Pap smears due to HPV in the past. Her pulse is 82/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. The abdomen is nontender, the uterus is consistent with 24 weeks' gestation, and the fetus is in a cephalic presentation. There are traces of blood on the vulva and the introitus. Speculum examination shows a tender, bruised cervix, with a closed cervical os. Fetal heart rate is 166/min and CTG shows a reassuring fetal heart rate tracing. Ultrasound shows a uniformly echogenic placenta located at the fundal end of the posterior uterine wall. What is the most likely cause of this patient's antepartum bleeding?
Options: 
1. Pedunculated cervical growth
2. Inflammation of the cervix
3. Cervical trauma
4. Fetal vessels overlying cervical os
5. Premature separation of the placenta
Correct Answer: Cervical trauma

GPT's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** 29-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 24 weeks' gestation achieved via in vitro fertilization.
- **Chief Complaint:** Vaginal bleeding and mild pelvic pain for 2 hours.
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - History of resumed sexual activity at week 22 after avoiding intercourse.
  - Tender, bruised cervix with closed cervical os observed on speculum examination.
  - Ultrasound shows a uniformly echogenic placenta located at the fundal end of the posterior uterine wall.
  - Vital signs are stable, and fetal heart tracing is reassuring.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline:** Acute onset of vaginal bleeding and pelvic pain lasting 2 hours.
- **Characteristics:**  
  - Bleeding is present after resumption of sexual intercourse.
  - Cervix is tender and bruised, indicating recent irritation or injury.
  - Closed cervical os suggests no active dilation or labor onset.
- **Interrelationships:**  
  - The timing of bleeding following sexual intercourse raises suspicion for trauma-related causes.
  - The ultrasound findings indicate the placenta is normally positioned (not previa), reducing the likelihood of placental causes.
  - Stable vital signs and reassuring fetal heart rate make severe placental abruption or vasa previa less likely.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Pedunculated Cervical Growth**  
  - **Unlikely:** No evidence of cervical lesions or growths on examination.
- **Option 2: Inflammation of the Cervix**  
  - **Possible but Less Likely:** While the cervix is tender, inflammation alone without other signs (e.g., infection) is less consistent with acute bleeding.
- **Option 3: Cervical Trauma**  
  - **Most Likely:** Resumption of sexual activity after avoiding intercourse, coupled with a tender and bruised cervix, strongly suggests trauma-induced bleeding.
- **Option 4: Fetal Vessels Overlying Cervical Os**  
  - **Unlikely:** Typically presents with painless bleeding and is associated with velamentous cord insertion, which is not indicated here.
- **Option 5: Premature Separation of the Placenta**  
  - **Unlikely:** Placenta is normally positioned on ultrasound, and bleeding associated with placental abruption is usually accompanied by more significant pain and possible fetal distress.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Cervical trauma) (宫颈外伤)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 3 (Cervical trauma)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 29-year-old woman at 24 weeks' gestation presents with vaginal bleeding and mild pelvic pain lasting 2 hours.  
- Key symptoms: Traces of blood on vulva/introitus, tender and bruised cervix with a closed cervical os, and reassuring fetal heart rate tracing.  
- Decisive signs: Bruised cervix, recent resumption of sexual activity at 22 weeks, and closed cervical os.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline and Symptoms**: The bleeding and pelvic pain coincided with recent sexual activity (resumed at 22 weeks), suggesting a mechanical cause.  
- **Cervical Examination**: A bruised and tender cervix with a closed os points to trauma rather than cervical incompetence or inflammation.  
- **Placental Location**: The placenta is fundal and posterior, ruling out placenta previa. The "uniformly echogenic placenta" likely represents a normal variant or unrelated finding.  
- **Fetal Monitoring**: A reassuring CTG and normal fetal heart rate exclude acute fetal compromise, reducing the likelihood of placental abruption.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Pedunculated cervical growth**: Unlikely, as cervical polyps or fibroids typically present with painless bleeding and lack bruising.  
2. **Inflammation of the cervix**: Less likely due to absence of purulent discharge or systemic signs of infection, despite HPV history.  
3. **Cervical trauma**: Strongly supported by the bruised and tender cervix, closed os, and recent sexual activity, which can mechanically injure cervical tissue.  
4. **Fetal vessels over cervical os**: Typically causes painless, sudden bleeding, often with an open os. The closed os and bruising here contradict this.  
5. **Premature separation of the placenta**: Excluded by the absence of uterine tenderness or hypertension (placental abruption often causes uterine irritability).  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Cervical trauma)(宫颈创伤)**  

**Key Evidence**:  
- Bruised and tender cervix with closed os aligns with mechanical injury (e.g., trauma from sexual intercourse).  
- Absence of uterine tenderness and reassuring fetal monitoring exclude placental abruption.  
- Recent resumption of sexual activity at 22 weeks provides a plausible mechanism for trauma.

Choice: Option 3 (Cervical trauma)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient:** 29-year-old G3P2 at 24 weeks’ gestation (IVF pregnancy), history of cesarean delivery, vaginal delivery, HPV-related abnormal Pap smears.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Vaginal bleeding and mild pelvic pain for 2 hours.  
- **Key Findings:**  
  - Recent resumption of sexual activity at 22 weeks.  
  - Tender, bruised cervix with closed os on speculum exam.  
  - Fundal posterior placenta on ultrasound, reassuring fetal heart rate (166/min).  
  - No uterine tenderness or placental abnormalities on imaging.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline:** Bleeding and pain followed recent resumption of sexual activity.  
- **Critical Observations:**  
  - **Cervical bruising/tenderness:** Directly linked to mechanical trauma (e.g., intercourse).  
  - **Closed cervical os:** Excludes placental abruption/previa (no cervical dilation or placental encroachment).  
  - **Fundal placenta on ultrasound:** Rules out placenta previa and vasa previa.  
  - **Absence of uterine contractions/tenderness:** Weakens placental abruption likelihood.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Pedunculated cervical growth (e.g., polyp):** Unlikely. No mass reported on exam/ultrasound; acute bleeding aligns better with trauma.  
2. **Cervical inflammation (e.g., cervicitis):** Less likely. No purulent discharge, systemic signs (fever), or history of recent infection.  
3. **Cervical trauma:** **Strongly supported.** History of recent intercourse, bruised/tender cervix, and acute bleeding. Trauma is common after cervical manipulation.  
4. **Fetal vessels overlying cervical os (vasa previa):** Excluded. Placenta is fundal; no velamentous cord insertion described.  
5. **Placental abruption:** Unlikely. No uterine rigidity, hypertension, or retroplacental clot on ultrasound.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Cervical trauma)(宫颈创伤)**  
- **Key Evidence:**  
  - Temporal association between resumed intercourse (22 weeks) and acute bleeding/pain.  
  - Physical exam findings (bruised, tender cervix with closed os).  
  - Ultrasound confirming normal placental location and fetal well-being.  
  - Exclusion of placental pathologies (previa/abruption) and other cervical/vascular causes.
