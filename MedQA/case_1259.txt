**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** A 15-year-old male.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Nausea and severe pain in the right shoulder following a fall from a bicycle.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - Acute distress following trauma (fall onto the right side).  
  - Swelling and tenderness over the right clavicle.  
  - Pain exacerbated by movement with limited range of motion.  
  - Intact skin over the clavicle, intact radial pulse, and no sensory abnormalities in the right upper limb.  
  - Vital signs: Temperature 37°C, pulse 85/min, respirations 15/min, blood pressure 135/85 mm Hg.  
  - X‑ray of the chest suggests a clavicular injury.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Mechanism of Injury:** The patient experienced a fall onto his right side during a bicycle accident, a common mechanism for clavicular fractures.  
- **Symptom Timeline:** Symptoms developed acutely within one hour post-injury, consistent with a traumatic fracture.  
- **Physical Examination:**  
  - Swelling and tenderness localized over the clavicle indicate a possible clavicular fracture.  
  - Pain worsens with movement, and range of motion is limited, supporting a musculoskeletal injury.  
  - Intact skin suggests no open fracture.  
  - Presence of radial pulse and normal sensory examination rule out neurovascular compromise.  
- **Imaging:** While the x‑ray is not visually available, the clinical presentation strongly suggests a clavicular fracture.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Perform tension banding**  
  - **Analysis:** Tension band wiring is typically used for fractures in areas like the patella or olecranon, not commonly for clavicular fractures.  
  - **Conclusion:** Not the most appropriate initial management.

- **Option 2: Apply a clavicular plate**  
  - **Analysis:** Surgical fixation with a clavicular plate is generally reserved for displaced or comminuted fractures not amenable to conservative management.  
  - **Conclusion:** May be indicated in specific cases but not as the initial step without further assessment of fracture displacement.

- **Option 3: Apply a simple shoulder sling**  
  - **Analysis:** Conservative management with a simple shoulder sling is the standard treatment for most clavicular fractures, especially when there is no neurovascular injury or significant displacement.  
  - **Conclusion:** Aligns well with the patient’s presentation and is supported by clinical guidelines.

- **Option 4: Obtain an MRI of the right shoulder**  
  - **Analysis:** MRI is useful for soft tissue evaluation but is unnecessary at this stage, where the clinical and radiographic signs point towards a clavicular fracture.  
  - **Conclusion:** Not indicated as the next immediate step.

- **Option 5: Perform arteriography**  
  - **Analysis:** Arteriography is indicated if there is suspicion of vascular injury. Given the intact radial pulse and no signs of vascular compromise, this is unnecessary.  
  - **Conclusion:** Not warranted based on current clinical findings.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Apply a simple shoulder sling)(使用简单的肩部吊带)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 3 (Apply a simple shoulder sling)

Qwen's full response:

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 15-year-old boy presents 1 hour after a fall onto his right side during a bicycle race.  
- Chief complaints: Severe right shoulder pain, nausea, and acute distress.  
- Key clinical manifestations: Swelling and tenderness over the right clavicle, limited range of motion exacerbated by movement, intact skin, intact radial pulse, and normal sensory examination.  
- Decisive symptoms: Mechanism of injury (direct trauma to the clavicle), localized tenderness, and intact neurovascular status.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Mechanism**: Direct trauma to the right clavicle is a classic cause of clavicle fractures, which are common in adolescents.  
- **Symptoms**: Severe pain, swelling, and tenderness localize the injury to the clavicle. Limited movement suggests protective guarding due to pain.  
- **Neurovascular Status**: Intact radial pulse and normal sensory examination rule out vascular or brachial plexus injury, reducing urgency for advanced imaging or surgery.  
- **Timing**: The acute presentation (1 hour post-injury) aligns with a recent trauma, and there is no evidence of delayed complications (e.g., nonunion).  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (Tension banding)**: Reserved for displaced midshaft clavicle fractures with significant displacement (>2 cm) or nonunion. No clinical or radiographic evidence of severe displacement is mentioned here.  
- **Option 2 (Clavicular plate)**: Typically used for complex fractures (e.g., comminuted, open, or failed nonunion). Unnecessary for an acute, closed injury without severe displacement.  
- **Option 3 (Simple shoulder sling)**: First-line treatment for most clavicle fractures, especially in adolescents, where conservative management is effective. Aligns with intact neurovascular status and lack of severe displacement.  
- **Option 4 (MRI of the right shoulder)**: Unnecessary for clavicle fractures, which are well-visualized on X-ray. MRI is indicated for soft tissue injuries (e.g., rotator cuff tears), which are not suggested here.  
- **Option 5 (Arteriography)**: Only indicated if there is clinical suspicion of vascular injury (e.g., absent pulses, cool limb). The intact radial pulse and normal vital signs negate this need.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Apply a simple shoulder sling)(应用简单的肩部吊带)**  

**Key Evidence Supporting the Choice**:  
- Clavicle fractures in adolescents are typically managed conservatively with a sling unless there is severe displacement or neurovascular compromise.  
- The patient’s intact neurovascular status and lack of open injury make surgery (options 1 and 2) unnecessary at this stage.  
- X-ray (already obtained) is sufficient to confirm the diagnosis, and MRI (option 4) or arteriography (option 5) are not indicated given the clinical findings.

Choice: Option 3 (Apply a simple shoulder sling)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 15-year-old boy, post-bicycle fall onto right side, 1 hour prior.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Severe right shoulder pain, nausea, limited shoulder motion.  
- **Key Findings**:  
  - Swelling and tenderness over the right clavicle.  
  - Pain exacerbated by movement, intact skin, normal radial pulse, and sensory exam.  
  - X-ray of the chest (implied clavicle fracture).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Trauma Mechanism**: Direct impact from a fall onto the shoulder, classic for clavicle fractures.  
- **Symptoms Consistency**: Pain, swelling, and tenderness localized to the clavicle align with a fracture. Intact skin and neurovascular status (normal pulse/sensation) rule out open fracture or major vascular/nerve injury.  
- **Implication of X-ray**: Likely confirms a non-displaced or minimally displaced clavicle fracture, given the absence of severe complications.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Tension banding (Option 1)**: Surgical fixation for displaced fractures or nonunion. Not indicated here due to intact skin and lack of displacement/neurovascular compromise.  
2. **Clavicular plate (Option 2)**: Open reduction/internal fixation for severe displacement or open fractures. Unnecessary in this stable, closed injury.  
3. **Simple shoulder sling (Option 3)**: Standard for non-displaced clavicle fractures to immobilize and promote healing. Aligns with clinical findings.  
4. **MRI (Option 4)**: Unnecessary if X-ray confirms fracture; no soft-tissue/ligament concerns raised.  
5. **Arteriography (Option 5)**: Indicated for suspected vascular injury (e.g., absent pulse). Normal radial pulse excludes this.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Apply a simple shoulder sling)(应用简单的肩部吊带)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Closed, non-displaced clavicle fracture confirmed by clinical and radiographic findings.  
  - Conservative management with a sling is guideline-recommended for uncomplicated cases.  
  - Absence of neurovascular deficits or displacement negates need for surgery or advanced imaging.
