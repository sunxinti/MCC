Case_description: 
A 60-year-old man presents to his local walk-in clinic with 1 week of fever, chills, night sweats, anorexia, malaise, progressive shortness of breath, and sharp chest pain. He is found with a blood pressure of 100/80 mm Hg, a heart rate of 84/min, an elevated respiratory rate, and a holosystolic heart murmur III/VI. His palms and soles show non-tender erythematous lesions. His personal medical history is relevant for frequent visits to the ER for lower gastrointestinal bleeding in the last month with a recent colonoscopy that reported an ulcerative lesion suggestive of colorectal cancer. He has not been subjected to dental procedures recently, and he denies the use of psychoactive drugs. A chest plain film shows clear lungs and mild cardiomegaly, and echocardiography reports the presence of vegetations involving the mitral valve. Which of the following organisms is the most likely causative agent?
Options: 
1. Kingella kingae
2. Staphylococcus aureus
3. Escherichia coli
4. Haemophilus aphrophilus
5. Streptococcus bovis
Correct Answer: Streptococcus bovis

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** A 60-year-old man with a recent history of frequent ER visits for lower gastrointestinal bleeding and a colonoscopy indicating an ulcerative lesion suggestive of colorectal cancer.
- **Chief Complaint:** Presents with a 1-week history of fever, chills, night sweats, anorexia, malaise, progressive shortness of breath, and sharp chest pain.
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - Vital Signs: Blood pressure of 100/80 mm Hg, heart rate of 84/min, elevated respiratory rate.
  - Physical Examination: Holosystolic heart murmur III/VI, non-tender erythematous lesions on palms and soles.
  - Imaging and Diagnostics: Chest X-ray showing clear lungs and mild cardiomegaly; echocardiography revealing vegetations on the mitral valve.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Duration and Progression:** Acute presentation over one week with systemic symptoms (fever, chills, night sweats) and cardiac involvement (vegetations, heart murmur).
- **Cardiac Findings:** Presence of vegetations on the mitral valve and a new heart murmur strongly suggest infective endocarditis.
- **Skin Findings:** Non-tender erythematous lesions on palms and soles are consistent with Janeway lesions, which are associated with infective endocarditis.
- **Relevant History:** Recent colonoscopy with findings suggestive of colorectal cancer is significant, as there is a known association between certain bacterial endocarditis and colonic lesions.
- **Opposing Features:** Absence of recent dental procedures makes organisms commonly associated with dental flora (e.g., certain streptococci) less likely.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Kingella kingae**  
  Primarily associated with pediatric endocarditis, especially in children under 5 years. Less likely in a 60-year-old adult.
  
- **Option 2: Staphylococcus aureus**  
  A common cause of acute infective endocarditis, especially in intravenous drug users or those with healthcare-associated infections. However, the association with colorectal cancer is not prominent.
  
- **Option 3: Escherichia coli**  
  Not a common cause of infective endocarditis. More frequently associated with urinary tract infections and sepsis, especially in the context of colorectal cancer.
  
- **Option 4: Haemophilus aphrophilus**  
  Part of the HACEK group, associated with subacute endocarditis. However, it does not have a specific association with colorectal cancer.
  
- **Option 5: Streptococcus bovis**  
  Strongly associated with infective endocarditis and colonic lesions, including colorectal cancer. The patient's recent colonoscopy findings and gastrointestinal bleeding history support this association.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 5 (Streptococcus bovis)（链球菌bovis）**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 5 (Streptococcus bovis)

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 60-year-old male presents with fever, chills, night sweats, anorexia, malaise, progressive shortness of breath, sharp chest pain, and non-tender erythematous lesions on palms/soles.  
- Key clinical findings: Holosystolic heart murmur (III/VI), echocardiography-confirmed mitral valve vegetations, recent lower gastrointestinal bleeding with a colonoscopy showing an ulcerative lesion suggestive of colorectal cancer, and mild cardiomegaly on chest X-ray.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Fever, chills, night sweats**: Classic constitutional symptoms of infective endocarditis (IE).  
- **Mitral valve vegetations**: Definitive imaging evidence of IE.  
- **Palms/soles erythematous lesions**: Likely **Janeway lesions** (nonthrombotic, nontender) or **Osler nodes** (thrombotic, tender), both associated with IE. The non-tender nature aligns more with Janeway lesions, commonly linked to *Staphylococcus aureus* but can occur in other IE cases.  
- **Recent GI bleeding and colorectal cancer suspicion**: A critical clue pointing to a gastrointestinal source of infection, such as *Streptococcus bovis*, which is strongly associated with colorectal malignancy.  
- **Timeline**: Subacute presentation (1 week of symptoms) is typical for subacute bacterial endocarditis, which often involves viridans streptococci or *Streptococcus bovis*.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1. Kingella kingae**: Rare in adults; primarily causes IE in children. Unlikely given the patient’s age and GI malignancy link.  
- **Option 2. Staphylococcus aureus**: Common in acute IE (e.g., IV drug use, skin infections), but subacute presentation here is less typical. While Janeway lesions could support this, the GI cancer association is stronger for another pathogen.  
- **Option 3. Escherichia coli**: Can cause IE in the context of UTI or intra-abdominal infections. However, the patient has no history of UTI or abdominal surgery, and the GI lesion’s link to *S. bovis* is more direct.  
- **Option 4. Haemophilus aphrophilus**: Part of the HACEK group (causing subacute IE), often associated with dental procedures. The patient denies recent dental work, but HACEK can occur without such exposure. However, the GI malignancy connection strongly favors *S. bovis*.  
- **Option 5. Streptococcus bovis**: **Most likely**. Strongly linked to colorectal cancer (up to 25–35% of *S. bovis* IE cases have concurrent colorectal malignancy). The patient’s recent GI bleeding and colonoscopy findings align perfectly with this association. The subacute presentation and mitral valve involvement are also consistent with viridans streptococcal IE.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 5 (Streptococcus bovis)(粪肠球菌)**

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 5 (Streptococcus bovis)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 60-year-old man with a history of recent lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and colonoscopy findings suggestive of colorectal cancer.  
- **Chief Complaint**: 1 week of fever, chills, night sweats, anorexia, malaise, progressive shortness of breath, and sharp chest pain.  
- **Key Findings**:  
  - **Vital Signs**: Hypotension (100/80 mm Hg), elevated respiratory rate, holosystolic murmur (III/VI).  
  - **Physical Exam**: Non-tender erythematous lesions on palms/soles (Janeway lesions).  
  - **Imaging**: Echocardiography reveals mitral valve vegetations; chest X-ray shows mild cardiomegaly.  
- **Decisive Features**: Janeway lesions, mitral valve vegetations, and history of colorectal cancer.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Infective Endocarditis (IE)**: Fever, chills, night sweats, and heart murmur are classic for IE. Janeway lesions (non-tender, embolic) strongly support this diagnosis.  
- **Timeline**: Subacute presentation (1 week) aligns with indolent pathogens like *Streptococcus bovis*.  
- **Underlying Condition**: Colorectal cancer (ulcerative lesion on colonoscopy) is a critical clue, as *S. bovis* endocarditis is strongly associated with colonic neoplasms.  
- **Contraindications**: Absence of dental procedures or IV drug use argues against *Kingella kingae* and *Staphylococcus aureus*.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Kingella kingae**: Typically affects children and young adults, causing osteoarticular infections. Rare in older adults without predisposing factors (e.g., prosthetic valves). **Low likelihood**.  
2. **Staphylococcus aureus**: Causes acute, rapidly progressive IE (e.g., in IV drug users or those with prosthetic valves). Absence of acute hemodynamic collapse or risk factors makes this **unlikely**.  
3. **Escherichia coli**: Rarely causes IE; more common in urinary/GI infections. No evidence of bacteremia from these sources. **Unlikely**.  
4. **Haemophilus aphrophilus**: Part of the HACEK group, associated with subacute IE but requires predisposing factors (e.g., dental procedures). Patient lacks such history. **Low likelihood**.  
5. **Streptococcus bovis**: Strongly linked to colonic pathology (e.g., cancer/polyps). Subacute IE in a patient with colorectal cancer is a hallmark of *S. bovis*. **Most likely**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 5 (Streptococcus bovis)(牛链球菌)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Mitral valve vegetations confirm IE.  
  - Janeway lesions and subacute presentation fit *S. bovis*’s indolent course.  
  - Colonoscopy findings (ulcerative lesion) provide critical context for *S. bovis* association with colorectal cancer.  
  - No evidence supporting other organisms (e.g., dental procedures for HACEK, IV drug use for *S. aureus*).
