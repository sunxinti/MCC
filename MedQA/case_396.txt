Case_description: 
A 25-year-old woman comes to the office complaining of pelvic pain and feeling “off” for the past few weeks. She has not had any changes in diet or lifestyle but reports weight loss despite an increase in appetite. In addition, she has been experiencing chest palpitations, increased frequency of diarrhea, and heat intolerance. Physical exam of her thyroid is unremarkable but her TSH was found to be 0.21 mIU/L. A complex structure in her right ovary was detected on ultrasound. Her symptoms can be explained by which of the following?
Options: 
1. Meigs syndrome
2. Jod-Basedow phenomenon
3. Dermoid cyst
4. Struma ovarii
5. Immature teratoma
Correct Answer: Struma ovarii

Choice: Option 4 (Struma ovarii)

GPT's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** 25-year-old woman.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Pelvic pain and feeling “off” for the past few weeks.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - Weight loss despite increased appetite.  
  - Chest palpitations.  
  - Increased frequency of diarrhea.  
  - Heat intolerance.  
  - Low TSH level (0.21 mIU/L).  
  - Unremarkable thyroid physical exam.  
  - Complex structure detected in the right ovary on ultrasound.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Hyperthyroid Symptoms:** The patient exhibits classic signs of hyperthyroidism, including weight loss with increased appetite, chest palpitations, diarrhea, and heat intolerance. The low TSH level further supports this diagnosis.  
- **Ovarian Findings:** The detection of a complex structure in the right ovary raises suspicion for an ovarian mass, which may be related to her systemic symptoms.  
- **Timeline and Interrelationship:** The onset of symptoms over a few weeks suggests an acute or subacute process. The coexistence of hyperthyroid symptoms with an ovarian mass implies a possible ectopic source of thyroid hormone production.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Meigs Syndrome:** Characterized by ovarian fibroma, ascites, and pleural effusion. The patient does not present with ascites or pleural effusion, making this option less likely.  
2. **Jod-Basedow Phenomenon:** Involves hyperthyroidism due to iodine exposure in individuals with autonomous thyroid tissue. There is no history of increased iodine intake, and the ovarian mass suggests an alternative source of thyroid hormone.  
3. **Dermoid Cyst:** A type of mature teratoma containing various tissue types, including thyroid tissue in rare cases. However, when thyroid tissue predominates, it is specifically termed struma ovarii.  
4. **Struma Ovarii:** A specialized form of mature teratoma composed predominantly of thyroid tissue. It can produce thyroid hormones ectopically, leading to hyperthyroidism. This aligns well with the patient's hyperthyroid symptoms and the presence of an ovarian mass.  
5. **Immature Teratoma:** A malignant ovarian germ cell tumor that is not typically associated with hyperthyroidism.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Struma ovarii)（甲状腺性畸胎瘤）**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 4 (Struma ovarii)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 25-year-old woman presenting with pelvic pain, malaise, unintentional weight loss despite increased appetite, palpitations, diarrhea, and heat intolerance over weeks.  
- **Key Symptoms**:  
  - **Hyperthyroidism features**: Weight loss, increased appetite, palpitations, diarrhea, heat intolerance.  
  - **Low serum TSH (0.21 mIU/L)**, indicating hyperthyroidism.  
  - **Complex ovarian mass** detected on ultrasound (right ovary).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Hyperthyroidism**: The constellation of weight loss, increased appetite, palpitations, diarrhea, and heat intolerance strongly suggests hyperthyroidism. The low TSH confirms this, as TSH suppression is a hallmark of thyroid hormone excess.  
- **Ovarian Mass**: The presence of a complex ovarian mass raises concern for a tumor. The hyperthyroidism must be linked to this mass to explain the clinical presentation.  
- **Normal Thyroid Exam**: The absence of thyroid abnormalities (e.g., goiter, nodules) suggests the hyperthyroidism is not due to a primary thyroid disorder but rather an ectopic source.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Meigs syndrome**: Requires a benign ovarian tumor (e.g., fibroma) associated with pleural/ascitic effusions, which resolve after tumor removal. **Does not fit**: Patient lacks effusions, and hyperthyroidism is not part of the syndrome.  
2. **Jod-Basedow phenomenon**: Hyperthyroidism induced by excessive iodine intake (e.g., contrast dye, supplements). **Unlikely**: No history of iodine exposure, and the ovarian mass is unrelated.  
3. **Dermoid cyst**: Common benign ovarian tumor containing ectodermal tissues (e.g., skin, hair). **Does not explain hyperthyroidism**, as dermoids lack thyroid tissue.  
4. **Struma ovarii**: A rare ovarian tumor composed predominantly of thyroid tissue, which can autonomously produce thyroid hormones. **Fits perfectly**: Explains hyperthyroidism (low TSH) and the ovarian mass, with a normal thyroid exam.  
5. **Immature teratoma**: Malignant ovarian germ cell tumor. **Does not cause hyperthyroidism** unless it contains thyroid tissue, but this is more characteristic of struma ovarii.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Struma ovarii)(卵巢甲状腺瘤)**  

**Key Evidence Supporting the Choice**:  
- The patient’s hyperthyroid symptoms (weight loss, palpitations, heat intolerance) and suppressed TSH indicate thyroid hormone excess.  
- The presence of a complex ovarian mass aligns with struma ovarii, where ectopic thyroid tissue in the ovary autonomously secretes thyroid hormones.  
- No thyroid abnormalities on physical exam rule out primary thyroid disease, pointing to an ectopic source (ovarian tumor).  
- Struma ovarii is the only option directly linking ovarian pathology to hyperthyroidism.

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 4 (Struma ovarii)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 25-year-old woman.  
- **Chief complaint**: Pelvic pain and feeling “off” for weeks.  
- **Key symptoms/signs**:  
  - Weight loss despite increased appetite.  
  - Chest palpitations, diarrhea, heat intolerance.  
  - **Low TSH (0.21 mIU/L)** indicating hyperthyroidism.  
  - Complex right ovarian structure on ultrasound.  
  - Normal thyroid physical exam.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Hyperthyroidism**: Weight loss, heat intolerance, palpitations, diarrhea, and suppressed TSH strongly suggest thyrotoxicosis. The normal thyroid exam excludes Graves’ disease or toxic nodular goiter as direct causes.  
- **Ovarian mass**: A complex ovarian lesion raises suspicion for a functional tumor.  
- **Key linkage**: The coexistence of hyperthyroidism and an ovarian mass suggests ectopic thyroid tissue (e.g., struma ovarii) as the source of excess thyroid hormone.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Meigs syndrome** (Option 1): Requires triad of ovarian fibroma, ascites, and pleural effusion. Absent here; no respiratory symptoms or fluid accumulation. **Excluded**.  
2. **Jod-Basedow phenomenon** (Option 2): Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism in pre-existing thyroid pathology. No history of iodine exposure or thyroid abnormalities. **Unlikely**.  
3. **Dermoid cyst** (Option 3): Benign teratoma with ectodermal tissues (e.g., hair, teeth). Rarely causes hyperthyroidism unless thyroid tissue is present (struma ovarii). **Does not explain thyrotoxicosis**.  
4. **Struma ovarii** (Option 4): Ovarian teratoma with functional thyroid tissue. Directly explains hyperthyroidism (autonomous hormone production) and the ovarian mass. Low TSH aligns with ectopic thyroid activity. **Strongly supported**.  
5. **Immature teratoma** (Option 5): Malignant germ cell tumor. Presents with rapid growth, systemic symptoms (e.g., pain, weight loss), but not hyperthyroidism. **Unrelated to thyroid dysfunction**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Struma ovarii)(卵巢甲状腺肿)**  
- **Key evidence**:  
  - Clinical and biochemical hyperthyroidism (low TSH, classic symptoms) without thyroid gland pathology.  
  - Ovarian mass on imaging, consistent with struma ovarii, which contains functional thyroid tissue.  
  - Exclusion of other causes (e.g., Graves’ disease, iodine-induced thyrotoxicosis).
