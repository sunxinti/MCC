Case_description: 
A 45-year-old man comes to the physician because of mild left-sided abdominal pain when lifting heavy objects that has developed over the past 6 months.

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** 45-year-old male.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Mild left-sided abdominal pain elicited when lifting heavy objects, persisting for the past 6 months.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - Significant weight loss of 41 kg (90 lbs) over the past year.  
  - Physical examination reveals a soft bulge inferior and lateral to the left navel.  
  - CT scan indicates an abdominal wall pathology (assumed to be a hernia based on clinical context).

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Pain Characteristics:** The pain is mild and associated with physical strain (lifting heavy objects), suggesting a mechanical cause such as a hernia that becomes symptomatic with increased intra-abdominal pressure.  
- **Weight Loss:** Unintentional and significant weight loss may indicate a chronic condition, potentially leading to weakening of abdominal wall structures and predisposition to herniation.  
- **Bulge Location:** A soft bulge inferior and lateral to the navel is suggestive of a hernia in the Spigelian or lateral abdominal wall region.  
- **Progression:** The gradual development over 6 months aligns with the slow expansion of a hernia sac.  
- **CT Findings:** Although not visually provided, the context implies the presence of a hernia, likely located in the lateral abdominal wall.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
Considering the location of the bulge and clinical presentation:

1. **Psoas Major:**  
   - *Anatomy:* Located deep in the posterior abdominal wall, lateral to the vertebral bodies.  
   - *Relevance:* Unlikely to be directly medial to a lateral abdominal wall hernia; more associated with retroperitoneal structures.

2. **Internal Oblique:**  
   - *Anatomy:* Positioned between the external oblique and transverse abdominis muscles; involved in forming the conjoint tendon.  
   - *Relevance:* If the hernia is through the Spigelian fascia (between internal oblique and transversus abdominis), the internal oblique is lateral, not medial.

3. **External Oblique:**  
   - *Anatomy:* The most superficial abdominal muscle layer.  
   - *Relevance:* Medial to the external oblique are internal oblique and transverse abdominis; unlikely to be directly medial to the hernia.

4. **Rectus Abdominis:**  
   - *Anatomy:* Runs vertically on each side of the anterior abdominal wall, enclosed in the rectus sheath.  
   - *Relevance:* A Spigelian hernia occurs through the Spigelian fascia, located lateral to the rectus abdominis; thus, the rectus abdominis is directly medial to the hernia.

5. **Transverse Abdominal:**  
   - *Anatomy:* The deepest of the flat abdominal muscles, lying beneath the internal oblique.  
   - *Relevance:* Medial to the transverse abdominis is the internal oblique; not directly adjacent to the hernia in this context.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Rectus abdominis)(腹直肌)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 4 (Rectus abdominis)

Qwen's full response:

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 45-year-old male presents with a 6-month history of mild left-sided abdominal pain exacerbated by heavy lifting and significant unintentional weight loss (41 kg in 1 year).  
- Physical examination reveals a soft bulge inferior and lateral to the umbilicus on the left.  
- The key findings are the pain on exertion, weight loss, and the location of the bulge, which are critical for diagnosing a hernia and identifying the involved anatomical structures.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Abdominal Pain and Lifting**: Pain triggered by increased intra-abdominal pressure (e.g., lifting) is classic for a hernia, as straining can enlarge the defect and cause discomfort.  
- **Weight Loss**: Significant unintentional weight loss raises concern for underlying pathology, such as malignancy or a chronic condition, but the primary focus here is the hernia’s anatomical relationship.  
- **Bulge Location**: The bulge’s position inferior and lateral to the umbilicus suggests an **inguinal hernia** (common in this region). The inguinal canal’s medial border is adjacent to the rectus abdominis muscle.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Psoas major**: Located posteriorly in the retroperitoneum, not part of the anterior abdominal wall. Unlikely to be medial to an inguinal hernia.  
- **Option 2: Internal oblique**: Part of the lateral abdominal wall layers. While involved in hernia formation, it is lateral to the hernia, not medial.  
- **Option 3: External oblique**: Superficial muscle forming the anterior abdominal wall. Also lateral to the hernia, not medial.  
- **Option 4: Rectus abdominis**: Runs vertically in the midline of the abdomen. The medial border of an inguinal hernia (e.g., direct/indirect) lies adjacent to the rectus abdominis sheath.  
- **Option 5: Transverse abdominal**: Deeper than the internal oblique but lateral to the rectus abdominis. Not the most medial muscle in this context.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The rectus abdominis is the most medial muscle adjacent to an inguinal hernia. The hernia’s medial boundary aligns with the rectus sheath, making this the correct choice.  

**My final selection is: Option 4 (Rectus abdominis)(腹直肌)**

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 4 (Rectus abdominis)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 45-year-old man.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Mild left-sided abdominal pain exacerbated by heavy lifting (6-month history) and unintentional weight loss (41 kg in 1 year).  
- **Key Findings**: Soft bulge located **inferior and lateral to the navel on the left**; CT scan suggests a hernia-like pathology.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline**: Chronic pain (6 months) + significant weight loss (likely unrelated to hernia but raises concern for malignancy or systemic illness).  
- **Pain Characteristics**: Exacerbated by increased intra-abdominal pressure (lifting), consistent with abdominal wall hernia.  
- **Bulge Location**: Inferior/lateral to the umbilicus on the left suggests a **ventral or Spigelian hernia** near the semilunar line.  
- **Weight Loss**: Unlikely directly related to hernia but warrants evaluation for other pathologies (e.g., malignancy, malabsorption).  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Anatomical Context**: The bulge is lateral to the rectus abdominis, near the semilunar line (Spigelian hernia) or inguinal region.  
- **Muscle Relationships**:  
  - **Psoas major (Option 1)**: Posterior retroperitoneal muscle; not adjacent to anterior abdominal wall hernias.  
  - **Internal/External Oblique (Options 2/3)**: Lateral abdominal wall muscles; located **lateral** to the pathology.  
  - **Transverse abdominal (Option 5)**: Deepest abdominal muscle; lies lateral to the rectus sheath but not directly medial.  
  - **Rectus abdominis (Option 4)**: Midline muscle; forms the **medial boundary** of the semilunar line and Hesselbach’s triangle. A hernia lateral to the rectus abdominis would have this muscle directly medial to it.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Rectus abdominis)(腹直肌)**  
- **Key Evidence**: The hernia is described as inferior and lateral to the umbilicus. The rectus abdominis lies medially in this region, forming the medial border of the semilunar line (site of Spigelian hernias) and Hesselbach’s triangle (site of direct inguinal hernias). The CT pathology’s medial neighbor is anatomically consistent with the rectus abdominis.
