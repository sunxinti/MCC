Case_description: 
Ten days after undergoing a cadaveric renal transplant, a 21-year-old man has pain in the right lower abdomen and generalized fatigue. During the past 2 days, he has had decreasing urinary output. He passed 5 liters of urine on the second postoperative day and serum studies showed a creatinine concentration of 2.1 mg/dL. He has adult polycystic kidney disease and was on maintenance hemodialysis for 2 months prior to transplantation. Current medications include azathioprine, cyclosporine, prednisone, and enalapril. He appears lethargic. His temperature is 37.8°C (100°F), pulse is 101/min, and blood pressure is 164/94 mm Hg. Examination shows a healing surgical incision in the right lower abdomen. The graft site shows tenderness to palpation. His blood urea nitrogen concentration is 52 mg/dL, creatinine concentration is 4.1 mg/dL. A biopsy of the transplanted kidney shows tubulitis. C4d staining is negative. Which of the following is the most likely responsible for this patient's findings?
Options: 
1. Recipient T-cells in the graft
2. Drug-induced nephrotoxicity
3. Fibrosis of the glomerular vessels
4. Polyomavirus-associated nephropathy
5. Newly formed anti-HLA antibodies

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** 21-year-old male with adult polycystic kidney disease, on maintenance hemodialysis for 2 months prior to receiving a cadaveric renal transplant 10 days ago.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Right lower abdominal pain and generalized fatigue.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - Decreasing urinary output over the past 2 days after an initial diuresis of 5 liters on the second postoperative day.  
  - Elevated serum creatinine: from 2.1 mg/dL post-op to 4.1 mg/dL.  
  - Elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 52 mg/dL.  
  - Vital signs indicating lethargy, slight fever (37.8°C), tachycardia (101/min), and hypertension (164/94 mm Hg).  
  - Physical examination shows tenderness at the graft site.  
  - Renal biopsy reveals tubulitis with negative C4d staining.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline:** The patient is in the early post-transplant period (10 days), a typical timeframe for acute cellular rejection.  
- **Symptoms and Signs:** Decreasing urinary output and rising creatinine and BUN suggest graft dysfunction. Tenderness at the graft site and systemic signs like fever and hypertension support an inflammatory or rejection process.  
- **Biopsy Findings:** Tubulitis is indicative of acute cellular rejection, where T-lymphocytes infiltrate the tubules. The absence of C4d staining suggests that antibody-mediated processes are less likely.  
- **Medication Context:** The patient is on immunosuppressive therapy (azathioprine, cyclosporine, prednisone) which is standard post-transplant but can have nephrotoxic effects. However, the biopsy findings are more consistent with rejection than drug toxicity.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  

1. **Recipient T-cells in the graft (Option 1):**  
   - **Alignment with Clinical Presentation:** High. Tubulitis on biopsy is characteristic of acute cellular rejection mediated by recipient T-cells. The negative C4d staining further supports a cellular rather than antibody-mediated process.  
   
2. **Drug-induced nephrotoxicity (Option 2):**  
   - **Alignment with Clinical Presentation:** Moderate. Cyclosporine is known for nephrotoxicity, but the biopsy typically shows arteriolar hyalinosis or tubular necrosis, not specifically tubulitis. The clinical picture aligns more closely with rejection.  
   
3. **Fibrosis of the glomerular vessels (Option 3):**  
   - **Alignment with Clinical Presentation:** Low. Fibrosis suggests chronic rejection, which is not consistent with the acute timeline of 10 days post-transplant.  
   
4. **Polyomavirus-associated nephropathy (Option 4):**  
   - **Alignment with Clinical Presentation:** Low. BK virus nephropathy usually occurs later post-transplant and presents with different histological features, such as viral inclusions and interstitial nephritis, not predominantly tubulitis.  
   
5. **Newly formed anti-HLA antibodies (Option 5):**  
   - **Alignment with Clinical Presentation:** Low. Antibody-mediated rejection typically presents with positive C4d staining, which is absent in this case.

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 1 (Recipient T-cells in the graft)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 21-year-old male underwent cadaveric renal transplantation 10 days ago. He now presents with right lower abdominal pain, generalized fatigue, and a 2-day history of decreased urine output.  
- Key symptoms include lethargy, fever (37.8°C), hypertension (164/94 mm Hg), graft-site tenderness, and significantly elevated serum creatinine (4.1 mg/dL) and BUN (52 mg/dL).  
- Biopsy findings of **tubulitis** and **negative C4d staining** are decisive for diagnosis.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline**: Symptoms developed 10 days post-transplant, which is within the high-risk window for **acute cellular rejection** (typically days to weeks post-transplant).  
- **Hypertension and oliguria**: Reflect acute kidney injury, likely due to impaired graft function.  
- **Graft-site tenderness**: Suggests local inflammation or rejection.  
- **Biopsy findings**: Tubulitis (inflammatory infiltrate in tubules) is hallmark of **acute cellular rejection (T-cell mediated)**. Negative **C4d staining** excludes antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), as C4d is a marker of complement activation in AMR.  
- **Medications**: Cyclosporine (immunosuppressant) and enalapril (ACE inhibitor) are on board, but nephrotoxicity (option 2) is less likely given the biopsy evidence of inflammation.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Recipient T-cells in the graft (acute cellular rejection)**:  
   - **Support**: Tubulitis on biopsy, timing (10 days post-transplant), rising creatinine, and graft-site tenderness.  
   - **Best fit**: Cellular rejection is the most common cause of early graft dysfunction with these features.  

2. **Drug-induced nephrotoxicity**:  
   - **Considered**: Cyclosporine can cause nephrotoxicity, but biopsy findings (tubulitis) are more consistent with rejection than drug injury.  

3. **Fibrosis of glomerular vessels**:  
   - **Unlikely**: Fibrosis develops over months/years, not days.  

4. **Polyomavirus-associated nephropathy (PVAN)**:  
   - **Unlikely**: PVAN typically occurs 3–6 months post-transplant, not 10 days.  

5. **Newly formed anti-HLA antibodies (antibody-mediated rejection)**:  
   - **Excluded**: Negative C4d staining rules out complement-mediated AMR, which requires C4d positivity.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1 (Recipient T-cells in the graft)(受者T细胞在移植物中)**

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 21-year-old man, 10 days post-cadaveric renal transplant, history of adult polycystic kidney disease and recent hemodialysis.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Right lower abdominal pain, generalized fatigue, and decreasing urinary output over 2 days.  
- **Key Findings**:  
  - Acute kidney injury (creatinine ↑ from 2.1 to 4.1 mg/dL, BUN 52 mg/dL).  
  - Graft site tenderness, low-grade fever (37.8°C), tachycardia (101/min), hypertension (164/94 mmHg).  
  - Biopsy findings: **tubulitis** (indicative of interstitial inflammation) and **negative C4d staining**.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline**: Symptoms emerge 10 days post-transplant, with initial good graft function (5L urine output on day 2). Declining function at day 10 aligns with **acute rejection** or **drug toxicity**.  
- **Critical Clues**:  
  - **Tubulitis** on biopsy is a hallmark of **acute cellular rejection (ACR)**.  
  - **Negative C4d** excludes antibody-mediated rejection (AMR).  
  - Cyclosporine toxicity typically lacks tubulitis and may show arteriolar hyalinosis/vacuolization.  
  - Early post-transplant timing makes chronic fibrosis (Option 3) or polyomavirus (Option 4, typically months later) unlikely.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Recipient T-cells in the graft (ACR)**:  
   - Strongly supported by **tubulitis** (T-cell-mediated tubular infiltration) and negative C4d. ACR peaks 1–3 weeks post-transplant.  
2. **Drug-induced nephrotoxicity**:  
   - Cyclosporine toxicity can cause AKI but lacks tubulitis. Biopsy findings oppose this.  
3. **Fibrosis of glomerular vessels**:  
   - Chronic process, incompatible with acute presentation (10 days post-op).  
4. **Polyomavirus-associated nephropathy**:  
   - Occurs months post-transplant, with viral inclusions on biopsy (not reported here).  
5. **Newly formed anti-HLA antibodies (AMR)**:  
   - Requires C4d positivity (negative here) and diffuse microvascular inflammation.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1 (Recipient T-cells in the graft)(移植物中的受体T细胞)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Tubulitis on biopsy is pathognomonic for acute cellular rejection.  
  - Negative C4d excludes AMR.  
  - Timing (10 days post-transplant) aligns with ACR’s typical onset.  
  - Drug toxicity and other options are inconsistent with histopathology or timeline.
