Case_description: 
A 31-year-old man with a history of schizophrenia is brought to the emergency department by police after being found agitated and attempting to steal from a grocery store. His past medical history is only notable for a recent office note from his primary care doctor for treatment of seasonal allergies. His temperature is 101°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 173/97 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, respirations are 16/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a man who is very irritable and restless. He is not cooperative with exam or history and becomes combative requiring intramuscular medications and security restraining him. After this event, the rest of his exam is notable for 7 mm pupils which are equal and reactive to light, spontaneous movement of all limbs, normal sensation, and warm and sweaty skin. The patient is answering questions and states he wants to kill himself. Which of the following substances was most likely used by this patient?
Options: 
1. Alcohol
2. Cocaine
3. Diphenhydramine
4. Haloperidol
5. Marijuana
Correct Answer: Cocaine

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** 31-year-old man with a history of schizophrenia.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Brought to the emergency department due to agitation and attempted theft from a grocery store.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - Vital Signs: Elevated temperature (101°F), hypertension (173/97 mmHg), tachycardia (105/min), normal respirations, and normal oxygen saturation.  
  - Physical Exam: Irritability, restlessness, combativeness requiring restraints, 7 mm pupils (dilated and reactive), spontaneous limb movements, normal sensation, warm and sweaty skin.  
  - Mental Status: Agitated, expressing suicidal ideation.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Sympathomimetic Signs:** The patient exhibits hypertension, tachycardia, hyperthermia, and mydriasis, which are indicative of sympathomimetic drug effects.  
- **Neurological Signs:** Dilated pupils (7 mm) suggest increased sympathetic tone or anticholinergic effects.  
- **Autonomic Signs:** Warm and sweaty skin points towards sympathetic overactivity rather than anticholinergic syndrome, which typically presents with dry skin.  
- **Behavioral Signs:** Agitation, irritability, restlessness, and combativeness are consistent with stimulant intoxication.  
- **Absence of Anticholinergic Features:** Lack of dry mucous membranes, urinary retention, or decreased bowel sounds makes anticholinergic toxicity less likely.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Alcohol**  
  - *Alignment:* Can cause agitation and elevated vital signs in intoxication.  
  - *Opposition:* Typically associated with normal or constricted pupils and does not usually cause significant hyperthermia or mydriasis.

- **Option 2: Cocaine**  
  - *Alignment:* Presents with sympathomimetic effects such as hypertension, tachycardia, hyperthermia, mydriasis, agitation, and diaphoresis.  
  - *Support:* The combination of dilated pupils, sweating, and heightened sympathetic activity is highly indicative of cocaine use.

- **Option 3: Diphenhydramine**  
  - *Alignment:* Anticholinergic effects include mydriasis and hyperthermia.  
  - *Opposition:* Typically causes dry skin, which is inconsistent with the patient's sweaty presentation.

- **Option 4: Haloperidol**  
  - *Alignment:* An antipsychotic that can cause extrapyramidal symptoms.  
  - *Opposition:* Does not produce sympathomimetic signs like hypertension and tachycardia.

- **Option 5: Marijuana**  
  - *Alignment:* Can cause agitation in some cases.  
  - *Opposition:* Generally associated with miosis (constricted pupils), not mydriasis, and does not typically cause significant hyperthermia or hypertension.

**4. Final Selection**  
Based on the patient's clinical presentation of sympathomimetic signs (hypertension, tachycardia, hyperthermia, mydriasis, and diaphoresis) coupled with behavioral agitation, cocaine use is the most consistent with the observed symptoms.

**My final selection is: Option 2 (Cocaine)(可卡因)**

Qwen is reasoning the answer...

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 2 (Cocaine)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 31-year-old man with schizophrenia presents to the emergency department after being found agitated and combative. His vital signs show fever (101°F), hypertension (173/97 mmHg), tachycardia (105/min), and warm, sweaty skin. Physical exam reveals dilated pupils (7 mm, reactive to light), normal limb movement and sensation, and significant agitation requiring sedation and restraints. The patient expresses suicidal ideation.  
- **Decisive symptoms**: Hyperadrenergic state (hypertension, tachycardia, fever, diaphoresis), dilated pupils, aggressive behavior, and acute agitation.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Hyperadrenergic state**: The combination of fever, tachycardia, hypertension, and diaphoresis strongly suggests excessive sympathetic nervous system activation.  
- **Agitation and aggression**: These are hallmark features of stimulant intoxication, especially in the context of a patient with schizophrenia, who may have a lower threshold for psychosis or behavioral disturbances.  
- **Pupil dilation**: Mydriasis (7 mm pupils) is characteristic of stimulant use (e.g., cocaine) or anticholinergic toxicity but less likely with alcohol, marijuana, or antipsychotics like haloperidol.  
- **Suicidal ideation**: While consistent with schizophrenia, the acute onset of agitation and aggression suggests an acute exacerbation triggered by substance use rather than a chronic issue.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (Alcohol)**: Alcohol intoxication typically causes CNS depression (slurred speech, ataxia, hypotension) rather than agitation or hypertension. Alcohol withdrawal can cause agitation and tachycardia but usually without fever or mydriasis. Unlikely.  
- **Option 2 (Cocaine)**: Cocaine intoxication causes hyperadrenergic symptoms (hypertension, tachycardia, fever, diaphoresis), mydriasis, agitation, and aggressive behavior. The timeline (acute presentation) and clinical features align perfectly. Strongly supports this diagnosis.  
- **Option 3 (Diphenhydramine)**: Overdose causes anticholinergic toxicity (dry skin, mydriasis, delirium, hyperthermia). While mydriasis may occur, the combination of hypertension, tachycardia, and diaphoresis is less typical. Diphenhydramine is sedating, so severe agitation would be unusual without additional stimulants. Less likely.  
- **Option 4 (Haloperidol)**: An antipsychotic overdose would cause extrapyramidal symptoms (rigidity, dystonia) and possibly hypotension, not hypertension or hyperthermia. The patient’s normal limb movement and hyperadrenergic state contradict this. Unlikely.  
- **Option 5 (Marijuana)**: Intoxication may cause tachycardia and mild agitation but rarely causes hypertension to 173/97 mmHg or fever. Pupils are typically minimally dilated. Unlikely.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Cocaine) (可卡因)**

Choice: Option 2 (Cocaine)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 31-year-old man with schizophrenia, recent seasonal allergies treatment.  
- **Presentation**: Agitation, combative behavior, suicidal ideation, fever (101°F), hypertension (173/97 mmHg), tachycardia (105/min), dilated pupils (7 mm, reactive), diaphoresis (warm/sweaty skin).  
- **Key Decisive Features**: Sympathomimetic toxidrome (hypertension, tachycardia, hyperthermia, dilated pupils, diaphoresis), acute agitation, and suicidal ideation.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Sympathomimetic Toxidrome**: Hypertension, tachycardia, hyperthermia, and diaphoresis indicate excessive adrenergic stimulation, typical of stimulants like cocaine.  
- **Dilated Pupils**: Reactive 7 mm pupils align with cocaine use (sympathetic activation), unlike anticholinergic agents (fixed dilation) or alcohol (variable).  
- **Psychiatric Symptoms**: Agitation, combativeness, and suicidal ideation are consistent with cocaine-induced psychosis, exacerbated by underlying schizophrenia.  
- **Opposing Features**: Absence of dry skin/flushing (anticholinergic), muscle rigidity (NMS), or sedation (alcohol/haloperidol overdose) excludes diphenhydramine, haloperidol, and alcohol.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Alcohol (Option 1)**: Intoxication causes sedation; withdrawal presents with tremors, hallucinations, but not hyperthermia/dilated pupils. **Excluded**.  
- **Cocaine (Option 2)**: Matches sympathomimetic toxidrome, agitation, suicidal ideation, and psychiatric exacerbation. **Strongly Supported**.  
- **Diphenhydramine (Option 3)**: Causes anticholinergic effects (dry skin, urinary retention, delirium). Sweaty skin contradicts this. **Excluded**.  
- **Haloperidol (Option 4)**: Overdose causes sedation/extrapyramidal symptoms; NMS includes rigidity/autonomic instability. Normal limb movement excludes this. **Excluded**.  
- **Marijuana (Option 5)**: Causes anxiety/paranoia but not severe hypertension, tachycardia, or hyperthermia. **Excluded**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Cocaine)(可卡因)**  
- **Key Evidence**: Sympathomimetic toxidrome (hypertension, tachycardia, hyperthermia, diaphoresis), reactive dilated pupils, and cocaine-induced psychosis align perfectly with the presentation. The absence of anticholinergic/NMS features and the patient’s agitation/suicidal ideation further support cocaine use.
