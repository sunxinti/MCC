Case_description: 
A 62-year-old woman presents to the emergency department for vision changes. About 90 minutes ago she was on the couch watching television with her husband when she suddenly noticed that she couldn't see the screen normally. She also felt a little dizzy. She has never had anything like this happen before. Her general physical exam is unremarkable. Her neurologic exam is notable for loss of vision in the right visual field of both eyes with macular sparing, though extraocular movements are intact. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head shows no acute intracranial process. Angiography of the brain will most likely show a lesion in which of the following vessels?
Options: 
1. Internal carotid artery
2. Anterior cerebral artery
3. Middle cerebral artery
4. Posterior cerebral artery
5. Basilar artery
Correct Answer: Posterior cerebral artery

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**
- **Patient Information:** A 62-year-old woman.
- **Chief Complaint:** Sudden vision changes.
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**
  - Onset: Approximately 90 minutes prior to presentation while watching television.
  - Symptoms: Inability to see the screen normally, accompanied by mild dizziness.
  - Neurologic Findings: Loss of vision in the right visual field of both eyes with macular sparing; extraocular movements intact.
  - Diagnostic Findings: Head CT shows no acute intracranial process.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**
- **Sudden Onset:** The abrupt nature of vision loss suggests an acute vascular event, such as a stroke.
- **Visual Field Deficit:** Bilateral right homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing points to a lesion in the occipital lobe, specifically the primary visual cortex. Macular sparing is typically due to dual blood supply from both the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) and the middle cerebral artery (MCA), often implicating the PCA when present.
- **Neurologic Exam:** Intact extraocular movements help localize the lesion away from the brainstem and ocular motor nerves.
- **Imaging:** A non-acute intracranial process on CT is consistent with early ischemic stroke before changes become evident on CT.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**
1. **Internal Carotid Artery:**
   - Supplies anterior structures, including the MCA and ACA territories.
   - Less directly associated with isolated occipital lobe deficits.
   - Less consistent with macular sparing homonymous hemianopia.
   
2. **Anterior Cerebral Artery:**
   - Supplies medial portions of the frontal and parietal lobes.
   - Typically associated with contralateral lower limb motor and sensory deficits.
   - Not aligned with the patient's visual deficits.
   
3. **Middle Cerebral Artery:**
   - Supplies lateral cerebral regions, including motor and sensory areas for the face and upper limbs.
   - Can extend to temporal regions but is less likely to cause isolated homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing.
   
4. **Posterior Cerebral Artery:**
   - Supplies the occipital lobe, including the primary visual cortex.
   - Responsible for homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing.
   - Aligns well with the patient's clinical presentation.
   
5. **Basilar Artery:**
   - Supplies the brainstem and cerebellum.
   - Lesions typically present with brainstem signs such as cranial nerve deficits, contralateral motor/sensory deficits, or altered consciousness.
   - Not consistent with isolated visual field loss without other brainstem signs.

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 4 (Posterior cerebral artery)

Qwen's full response:

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 62-year-old woman presents with sudden vision changes and dizziness while watching TV.  
- Key symptoms: Sudden bilateral loss of the right visual field in both eyes with **macular sparing**, intact extraocular movements, and no acute intracranial process on CT.  
- Decisive signs: Homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing, indicating a lesion in the visual pathway beyond the optic chiasm and lateral geniculate nucleus (likely the optic radiation or occipital cortex).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Visual Field Defect**: Homonymous hemianopia (right visual field loss in both eyes) suggests a lesion in the left hemisphere.  
- **Macular Sparing**: Indicates preservation of central vision, which occurs when peripheral visual pathways are damaged while central pathways (Meyer’s loop of the optic radiation) are spared. This is characteristic of a lesion in the **posterior limb of the internal capsule** or **occipital lobe**, supplied by the posterior cerebral artery (PCA).  
- **Timing and Onset**: Sudden onset aligns with an acute vascular event (e.g., stroke). Normal CT rules out hemorrhage but does not exclude ischemia, as early ischemic changes may not be visible.  
- **Intact Extraocular Movements**: Rules out ocular or brainstem causes (e.g., third nerve palsy or brainstem stroke).  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Internal Carotid Artery**  
  - Unlikely. The internal carotid artery supplies the anterior and middle cerebral arteries. Lesions here would affect the ACA or MCA territories (e.g., anterior circulation strokes), not the posterior visual pathways.  

- **Option 2: Anterior Cerebral Artery**  
  - Unlikely. The ACA supplies the medial aspects of the cerebral hemispheres and does not involve visual pathways.  

- **Option 3: Middle Cerebral Artery**  
  - Unlikely. The MCA supplies the lateral aspects of the frontal and parietal lobes. A lesion here would cause contralateral motor/sensory deficits, not homonymous hemianopia.  

- **Option 4: Posterior Cerebral Artery**  
  - Most likely. The PCA supplies the occipital lobe and posterior temporal lobe, including the optic radiation (geniculocalcarine pathway). A PCA territory stroke would explain homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing due to damage to peripheral visual pathways while sparing Meyer’s loop.  

- **Option 5: Basilar Artery**  
  - Less likely. Basilar artery lesions typically affect brainstem structures, causing vertebrobasilar insufficiency symptoms (e.g., ataxia, diplopia, vertigo). While homonymous visual field defects may occur, macular sparing is less specific here compared to PCA territory involvement.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Posterior cerebral artery)(后交通动脉)**  

Key evidence supporting this choice:  
- Homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing is pathognomonic for a lesion in the **optic radiation** or occipital cortex, which is supplied by the posterior cerebral artery.  
- The PCA is the primary vessel supplying the occipital lobe, where the posterior part of the optic radiation and visual cortex reside.  
- The clinical presentation aligns with a PCA territory stroke, and angiography would likely show occlusion or stenosis in this vessel.

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 4 (Posterior cerebral artery)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient:** 62-year-old woman with sudden onset right visual field loss in both eyes and mild dizziness for 90 minutes.  
- **Key Symptoms/Signs:**  
  - Sudden right homonymous hemianopia **with macular sparing**.  
  - Normal extraocular movements and general physical exam.  
  - No acute intracranial abnormalities on CT scan.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Visual Field Defect:** Right homonymous hemianopia indicates a lesion in the left occipital lobe (contralateral to the visual field loss).  
- **Macular Sparing:** Suggests preserved blood supply to the occipital pole (macula region), classically associated with **posterior cerebral artery (PCA)** occlusion. The macula may receive collateral circulation from the middle cerebral artery (MCA).  
- **Negative CT Scan:** Acute ischemic strokes may not appear on CT within 90 minutes, making angiography critical for vascular evaluation.  
- **Intact Extraocular Movements:** Rules out brainstem (e.g., basilar artery) involvement.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Internal Carotid Artery (ICA):** ICA occlusion typically causes MCA territory symptoms (e.g., hemiparesis, aphasia) or retinal ischemia (monocular vision loss). **Inconsistent with bilateral homonymous hemianopia.**  
2. **Anterior Cerebral Artery (ACA):** ACA supplies medial frontal lobes; lesions cause leg weakness or executive dysfunction. **No link to vision loss.**  
3. **Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA):** MCA strokes affecting optic radiations can cause homonymous hemianopia but **rarely spare the macula**.  
4. **Posterior Cerebral Artery (PCA):** PCA supplies the occipital lobe. Occlusion causes contralateral homonymous hemianopia **with macular sparing** (due to MCA collaterals). **Best matches the presentation.**  
5. **Basilar Artery:** Brainstem strokes cause diplopia, dysarthria, or quadriparesis. **No brainstem signs here.**  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Posterior cerebral artery)(大脑后动脉)**  
- **Key Evidence:**  
  - Right homonymous hemianopia localizes to the left occipital lobe.  
  - Macular sparing strongly suggests PCA territory ischemia.  
  - Absence of brainstem or cortical deficits excludes basilar/MCA/ACA involvement.  
  - Sudden onset aligns with acute vascular occlusion.
