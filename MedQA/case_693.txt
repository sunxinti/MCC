Case_description: 
A 38-year-old woman presents to her physician’s clinic for recurrent episodes of chest pain that wakes her from her sleep. While usually occurring late at night, she has also had similar pains during the day at random times, most recently while sitting at her desk in her office and at other times while doing the dishes at home. The pain lasts 10–15 minutes and resolves spontaneously. She is unable to identify any common preceding event to pain onset. The remainder of her history is unremarkable and she takes no regular medications. She works as an accountant. There is no history of smoking or drug use, however, she does consume 5 alcoholic drinks per week. Examination reveals: pulse 70/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 120/70 mm Hg. A physical examination is unremarkable. Which of the following would be effective in reducing her symptoms?
Options: 
1. Aspirin
2. Digoxin
3. Isosorbide dinitrate
4. Heparin
5. Propranolol
Correct Answer: Isosorbide dinitrate

GPT's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**
- **Patient Information:** 38-year-old woman, accountant.
- **Chief Complaint:** Recurrent episodes of chest pain.
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**
  - Chest pain occurring both late at night and during daytime activities (e.g., sitting at desk, doing dishes).
  - Pain duration: 10–15 minutes, resolves spontaneously.
  - Pain wakes her from sleep.
- **Additional Information:** No identifiable triggers, unremarkable medical history, normal vital signs, and physical examination.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**
- **Chest Pain Characteristics:** The pain is recurrent, lasts for a moderate duration, and resolves without intervention. The absence of exertional triggers suggests a non-anginal cause or a variant form of angina.
- **Timing of Episodes:** Occurrence during rest and sleep is atypical for stable angina, which is usually exertion-induced. Nighttime angina raises suspicion for variant angina (Prinzmetal’s angina).
- **Lack of Precipitating Factors:** No association with physical activity or stress, which further supports the possibility of coronary vasospasm.
- **Patient Demographics:** A younger female without traditional risk factors (e.g., smoking, hypertension) aligns with the profile for Prinzmetal’s angina.
- **Resolution:** Spontaneous resolution of pain is consistent with transient vasospasm.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**
- **Option 1: Aspirin**
  - **Use:** Antiplatelet agent primarily used in acute coronary syndromes and prevention of myocardial infarction.
  - **Relevance:** While useful in ischemic heart disease, it does not directly address vasospasm.
- **Option 2: Digoxin**
  - **Use:** Treats heart failure and certain arrhythmias.
  - **Relevance:** No evidence of heart failure or arrhythmia in this patient.
- **Option 3: Isosorbide dinitrate**
  - **Use:** Nitrate that causes vasodilation, effective in treating and preventing angina by reducing myocardial oxygen demand and preventing coronary vasospasm.
  - **Relevance:** Directly addresses the likely diagnosis of variant angina by alleviating coronary artery spasm.
- **Option 4: Heparin**
  - **Use:** Anticoagulant used in acute coronary syndromes and thromboembolic conditions.
  - **Relevance:** Not indicated without evidence of thrombosis or acute coronary syndrome.
- **Option 5: Propranolol**
  - **Use:** Beta-blocker used in treating hypertension, certain arrhythmias, and angina.
  - **Relevance:** While beta-blockers can help in stable angina, they are not first-line for variant angina and may potentially exacerbate coronary vasospasm in Prinzmetal’s angina.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Isosorbide dinitrate)(硝酸异山梨酯)**

Qwen is reasoning the answer...

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 3 (Isosorbide dinitrate)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 38-year-old woman presents with recurrent chest pain that wakes her at night and occurs sporadically during daytime activities (e.g., sitting at a desk or doing dishes).  
- Pain lasts 10–15 minutes and resolves spontaneously. No identifiable triggers or preceding events.  
- Normal vital signs (pulse 70/min, BP 120/70 mm Hg, respirations 16/min). Physical examination is unremarkable.  
- Key symptoms: Nocturnal chest pain (waking her from sleep), pain during rest, and transient nature of symptoms.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Nocturnal chest pain**: A hallmark of **Prinzmetal’s angina (coronary artery spasm)**, which typically occurs at rest and is not activity-induced.  
- **Pain during daytime rest**: Further supports coronary spasm, as it is unrelated to exertion.  
- **Self-limiting nature**: Resolves without intervention, consistent with vasospastic angina.  
- **Normal exam and risk factors**: Absence of traditional CAD risk factors (smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia) makes atherosclerotic coronary artery disease less likely.  
- **Alcohol use**: Minimal (5 drinks/week), unlikely to directly cause chest pain.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Aspirin**: Used for antiplatelet therapy in atherosclerotic CAD or acute coronary syndrome. However, the clinical features suggest coronary spasm rather than thrombosis, making aspirin less directly effective for symptom relief.  
2. **Digoxin**: Used for heart failure or atrial fibrillation. Irrelevant to coronary spasm or angina.  
3. **Isosorbide dinitrate (nitrate)**: First-line therapy for **Prinzmetal’s angina**. Nitrates dilate coronary arteries, reduce spasm, and improve myocardial perfusion, directly addressing the pathophysiology.  
4. **Heparin**: Anticoagulant used in acute thrombotic events. Unnecessary here, as there is no evidence of thrombosis.  
5. **Propranolol (non-selective beta-blocker)**: May worsen coronary spasm by causing unopposed alpha-adrenergic effects. Beta-blockers are typically avoided in vasospastic angina.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Isosorbide dinitrate) (单硝酸异山梨酯)**  

**Key evidence**:  
- The clinical presentation (nocturnal chest pain, rest-induced pain, self-limiting course) strongly supports **Prinzmetal’s angina (coronary artery spasm)**.  
- Nitrates (isosorbide dinitrate) are the **first-line treatment** for coronary vasospasm, as they dilate coronary arteries and prevent spasm.  
- Other options (aspirin, heparin, propranolol) are either ineffective or contraindicated in this context.

Choice: Option 3 (Isosorbide dinitrate)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 38-year-old woman, non-smoker, moderate alcohol intake (5 drinks/week).  
- **Chief Complaint**: Recurrent chest pain waking her from sleep, occurring unpredictably at rest (night/day). Episodes last 10–15 minutes, resolve spontaneously. No identifiable triggers.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Pain at rest (nocturnal and daytime), unrelated to exertion.  
  - Normal physical exam and vital signs.  
  - No significant cardiovascular risk factors.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Pain Characteristics**:  
  - **Timing**: Nocturnal and rest-related, transient (10–15 minutes).  
  - **Pattern**: Spontaneous resolution, no consistent triggers.  
- **Support for Vasospastic Angina (Prinzmetal’s)**:  
  - Rest pain, especially nocturnal, aligns with coronary artery vasospasm.  
  - Absence of atherosclerosis risk factors (young age, non-smoker, normal BP).  
- **Against Typical Angina**:  
  - No exertion-induced pain.  
  - Normal physical exam and stable vitals argue against unstable angina/acute ischemia.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Aspirin**: Antiplatelet therapy for atherosclerotic disease. Not effective for vasospasm.  
2. **Digoxin**: Used in heart failure/arrhythmias. Irrelevant here.  
3. **Isosorbide dinitrate**: Nitrate that relaxes coronary smooth muscle, relieves vasospasm. Directly targets the pathophysiology of Prinzmetal’s angina.  
4. **Heparin**: Anticoagulant for acute coronary syndromes. No evidence of thrombosis/ischemia.  
5. **Propranolol**: Beta-blockers reduce myocardial oxygen demand but may worsen vasospasm by unopposed alpha-mediated constriction. Contraindicated in Prinzmetal’s.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Isosorbide dinitrate)（硝酸异山梨酯）**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Rest/nocturnal pain strongly suggests coronary vasospasm.  
  - Nitrates (e.g., isosorbide dinitrate) are first-line for preventing/relieving vasospastic angina.  
  - Other options lack mechanistic alignment or risk exacerbation (e.g., beta-blockers).
