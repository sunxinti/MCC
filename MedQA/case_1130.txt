**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** 35-year-old woman.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Intermittent episodes of heart palpitations for 3 weeks.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - Chest pain: Sharp, localized to the left 3rd intercostal space.  
  - Appearance: Nervous.  
  - Vital Signs: Pulse 110/min and irregularly irregular; Blood pressure 135/85 mmHg.  
  - Physical Examination:  
    - Fine tremor on both hands.  
    - Digital swelling.  
    - Retraction of the left upper eyelid.  
    - Systolic ejection murmur along the right upper sternal border.  
    - Warm extremities with 2+ pulses bilaterally.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Cardiac Symptoms:** The patient presents with palpitations and an irregularly irregular pulse, which are suggestive of atrial fibrillation.  
- **Neuromuscular Signs:** Fine tremor and digital swelling may indicate hypermetabolic states or connective tissue disorders.  
- **Ophthalmologic Signs:** Retraction of the upper eyelid is a classic sign of Graves' disease, a form of hyperthyroidism.  
- **Additional Signs:** A systolic ejection murmur and warm extremities suggest a hyperdynamic circulatory state, commonly seen in hyperthyroidism.  
- **Behavioral Signs:** Appearance of being nervous aligns with anxiety, which can be both a symptom and a consequence of hyperthyroidism.  
- **Timeline:** The 3-week history of symptoms indicates an acute to subacute onset, which is consistent with the recent development of atrial fibrillation in the context of hyperthyroidism.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Propranolol (Option 1):** A beta-blocker that is first-line therapy in hyperthyroidism to control adrenergic symptoms and manage atrial fibrillation. It also decreases peripheral conversion of T4 to T3.  
- **Digoxin (Option 2):** Used for rate control in atrial fibrillation but less effective in hyperthyroid-induced atrial fibrillation due to increased adrenergic tone.  
- **Amiodarone (Option 3):** An antiarrhythmic that can be used in atrial fibrillation but is not first-line and has significant side effects, especially in hyperthyroid patients.  
- **Warfarin (Option 4):** Anticoagulation is important in atrial fibrillation to prevent thromboembolism, but it does not address the underlying hyperthyroidism or rate control.  
- **Diltiazem (Option 5):** A calcium channel blocker used for rate control in atrial fibrillation but does not address the hyperthyroid state and has less efficacy compared to beta-blockers in this context.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1 (Propranolol)(普萘洛尔)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 1 (Propranolol)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 35-year-old woman presents with 3 weeks of intermittent heart palpitations, sharp, localized chest pain at the left 3rd intercostal space, and nervousness.  
- Key clinical findings: Irregularly irregular pulse (110/min), elevated blood pressure (135/85 mmHg), fine hand tremors, digital swelling, left upper eyelid retraction, and a systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Irregularly irregular pulse and tachycardia**: Suggest atrial fibrillation (AF), a common arrhythmia in hyperthyroidism or structural heart disease.  
- **Hyperthyroidism features**: Fine tremors, eyelid retraction (possible Graves’ ophthalmopathy), and nervousness strongly indicate hyperthyroidism. These symptoms are exacerbated by the patient’s alcohol use (ethanol can transiently worsen thyroid hormone effects).  
- **Systolic ejection murmur**: Localized to the right upper sternal border, typical of aortic stenosis. However, hyperthyroidism can cause a flow murmur due to increased cardiac output, making it challenging to distinguish from structural disease.  
- **Digital swelling**: Could represent clubbing (seen in chronic hypoxia or malignancy) or edema from hyperthyroidism.  
- **Chest pain**: Sharp and localized to the left 3rd intercostal space may be non-cardiac (e.g., musculoskeletal) but requires exclusion of pericarditis or angina.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Propranolol (β-blocker)**:  
  - **Support**: First-line for rate control in AF, especially in hyperthyroidism to reduce symptoms like tremors and tachycardia.  
  - **Concern**: β-blockers are contraindicated in severe aortic stenosis, but the murmur may be a benign flow murmur in hyperthyroidism.  
- **Option 2: Digoxin**:  
  - **Support**: Used for rate control in AF but less effective than β-blockers in hyperthyroidism.  
  - **Concern**: Risk of toxicity and limited utility in this setting.  
- **Option 3: Amiodarone**:  
  - **Support**: Used for rhythm control in AF.  
  - **Concern**: Not first-line for rate control; significant side effects (e.g., thyroid dysfunction, pulmonary toxicity).  
- **Option 4: Warfarin**:  
  - **Support**: Anticoagulation for AF stroke prevention.  
  - **Concern**: Not directly treating the arrhythmia or palpitations; prioritization depends on AF duration and risk factors.  
- **Option 5: Diltiazem (calcium channel blocker)**:  
  - **Support**: Alternative for rate control in AF if β-blockers are contraindicated.  
  - **Concern**: Less preferred than β-blockers in hyperthyroidism due to lack of symptom control for tremors.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The patient’s clinical features strongly suggest hyperthyroidism-induced AF. Propranolol addresses both rate control in AF and symptom relief (tremors, tachycardia). The systolic murmur is likely a benign flow murmur given her hyperthyroidism, making β-blocker use acceptable. While aortic stenosis cannot be entirely excluded, it is less likely in a 35-year-old without severe symptoms.  

**My final selection is: Option 1 Propranolol (普萘洛尔)**

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 1 (Propranolol)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 35-year-old woman.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Intermittent heart palpitations for 3 weeks, sharp chest pain localized to the left 3rd intercostal space.  
- **Key Findings**:  
  - **Vital Signs**: Tachycardia (pulse 110/min, irregularly irregular), BP 135/85 mmHg.  
  - **Physical Exam**: Fine hand tremor, digital swelling, left upper eyelid retraction, systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border, warm extremities, and 2+ pulses.  
  - **Behavioral**: Appears nervous.  

**Decisive Features**:  
- Irregularly irregular pulse (atrial fibrillation).  
- Signs of hyperthyroidism (tremor, eyelid retraction, digital swelling suggestive of thyroid acropachy).  
- Systolic ejection murmur (high-output state from hyperthyroidism).  

---

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline**: Subacute onset (3 weeks) of palpitations and chest pain.  
- **Symptoms Interrelationship**:  
  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is likely secondary to hyperthyroidism, supported by tremor, eyelid retraction, and digital swelling.  
  - Systolic murmur reflects increased cardiac output, common in hyperthyroidism.  
- **Contradictory Features**: No history of smoking or alcohol excess rules out alcohol-induced AF.  

---

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Propranolol**:  
   - **Alignment**: First-line for rate control in hyperthyroidism-induced AF. Reduces adrenergic symptoms (tremor, palpitations) and inhibits peripheral T4-to-T3 conversion.  
   - **Guidelines**: ACC/AHA recommends beta-blockers for AF with hyperthyroidism.  

2. **Digoxin**:  
   - **Contraindication**: Less effective in hyperthyroidism due to sympathetic override and digoxin resistance.  

3. **Amiodarone**:  
   - **Contraindication**: High iodine content exacerbates thyroid dysfunction; avoid in hyperthyroidism.  

4. **Warfarin**:  
   - **Irrelevant**: CHA2DS2-VASc score likely 1 (female sex only), insufficient for anticoagulation.  

5. **Diltiazem**:  
   - **Alternative**: Effective for rate control but lacks anti-adrenergic benefits of beta-blockers.  

---

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1 (Propranolol)(普萘洛尔)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  1. Hyperthyroidism-induced AF requires beta-blockers for dual rate control and symptom relief.  
  2. Propranolol addresses tremor, tachycardia, and thyroid hormone conversion.  
  3. Contraindications apply to other options (amiodarone, digoxin). Warfarin and diltiazem are less optimal.
