Case_description: 
A novel type of PET radiotracer is being developed to evaluate patients with Parkinson’s disease. A clinical research study has enrolled 1,200 patients, half of whom have the disease. The scan is found to be positive in 590 of the 600 patients with known PD, and positive in 20 of the 600 patients without PD. What is the test’s overall specificity?
Options: 
1. 580 / (20 + 590)
2. 580 / (10 + 580)
3. 590 / (590 + 20)
4. 590 / (590 + 10)
5. 580 / (580 + 20)

GPT's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Study Design and Population:** A clinical research study is evaluating a novel PET radiotracer for Parkinson’s disease (PD) detection. The study has enrolled 1,200 patients, with an equal distribution of 600 patients diagnosed with PD and 600 without PD.  
- **Test Results:** The PET scan yielded positive results in 590 out of 600 patients with PD and in 20 out of 600 patients without PD.  
- **Key Metrics:** The critical metrics for diagnosis are the number of true positives (patients correctly identified with PD) and false positives (patients incorrectly identified as having PD).

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **True Positives (TP):** 590 patients with PD tested positive.  
- **False Negatives (FN):** 600 PD patients minus 590 TP equals 10 patients who have PD but tested negative.  
- **False Positives (FP):** 20 patients without PD tested positive.  
- **True Negatives (TN):** 600 patients without PD minus 20 FP equals 580 patients who correctly tested negative.  
- **Specificity Definition:** Specificity measures the ability of the test to correctly identify those without the disease (true negatives) out of all actual negatives. It is calculated as TN / (TN + FP).  
- **Calculation:** Specificity = 580 / (580 + 20) = 580 / 600 ≈ 96.67%

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1:** 580 / (20 + 590) = 580 / 610 ≈ 95.08%  
  - **Analysis:** Incorrect denominator; mixes true negatives with true positives.  
- **Option 2:** 580 / (10 + 580) = 580 / 590 ≈ 98.31%  
  - **Analysis:** Incorrect denominator; uses false negatives instead of false positives.  
- **Option 3:** 590 / (590 + 20) = 590 / 610 ≈ 96.72%  
  - **Analysis:** This calculates the positive predictive value, not specificity.  
- **Option 4:** 590 / (590 + 10) = 590 / 600 ≈ 98.33%  
  - **Analysis:** Incorrect metric; relates to sensitivity or positive predictive value.  
- **Option 5:** 580 / (580 + 20) = 580 / 600 ≈ 96.67%  
  - **Analysis:** Correctly calculates specificity by dividing true negatives by the sum of true negatives and false positives.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 5 (580 / (580 + 20))(580 / (580 + 20))**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 5 (580 / (580 + 20))

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- The clinical study involves 1,200 patients, with 600 diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and 600 without PD.  
- The new PET radiotracer yielded 590 positive results in PD patients (true positives) and 20 positive results in non-PD patients (false positives).  
- Key data points: True positives (TP) = 590, false positives (FP) = 20, true negatives (TN) = 600 – 20 = 580, false negatives (FN) = 600 – 590 = 10.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Specificity** is defined as the ability of a test to correctly identify those without the disease (true negatives). The formula is **Specificity = TN / (TN + FP)**.  
- Here, TN = 580 (non-PD patients with negative results), and FP = 20 (non-PD patients with false-positive results).  
- The question requires calculating specificity, not sensitivity or predictive value, which rules out options involving TP or FN in the denominator.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (580 / (20 + 590))**: Incorrect. The denominator (20 + 590 = 610) combines FP and TP, which is irrelevant to specificity.  
- **Option 2 (580 / (10 + 580))**: Incorrect. The denominator (10 + 580 = 590) combines FN and TN, which does not align with specificity’s formula.  
- **Option 3 (590 / (590 + 20))**: Incorrect. This calculates the **positive predictive value (PPV)**, not specificity.  
- **Option 4 (590 / (590 + 10))**: Incorrect. This calculates **sensitivity**, not specificity.  
- **Option 5 (580 / (580 + 20))**: Correct. This directly applies the specificity formula: TN (580) divided by TN + FP (580 + 20 = 600).  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 5 (580 / (580 + 20))(580除以580加20)**

Choice: Option 5 (580 / (580 + 20))

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**My final selection is: Option 5 (580 / (580 + 20))**  

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Population**: 1,200 patients (600 with Parkinson’s disease [PD], 600 without PD).  
- **Test Results**:  
  - PD patients: 590 tested positive (true positives), 10 tested negative (false negatives).  
  - Non-PD patients: 20 tested positive (false positives), 580 tested negative (true negatives).  
- **Key Metric**: Specificity (ability to correctly identify non-PD patients).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- Specificity is defined as:  
  \[
  \text{Specificity} = \frac{\text{True Negatives (TN)}}{\text{True Negatives (TN) + False Positives (FP)}}.
  \]  
- In this case:  
  - **TN** = 580 (non-PD patients with negative scans).  
  - **FP** = 20 (non-PD patients with positive scans).  
- Incorrect options (1–4) either misapply sensitivity (e.g., using true positives) or miscalculate denominators.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 5** directly applies the specificity formula: \(580 / (580 + 20)\).  
- **Other options**:  
  - **Options 1, 3, 4**: Use true positives (590) or incorrect denominators, reflecting sensitivity or invalid ratios.  
  - **Option 2**: Incorrectly assumes 10 false negatives (irrelevant to specificity).  

**4. Final Selection**  
- **Key Evidence**: Specificity requires focusing on non-PD patients (TN and FP). Option 5 is the only choice that correctly uses TN (580) and FP (20).  
**My final selection is: Option 5 (580 / (580 + 20))**
