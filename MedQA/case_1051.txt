Okay, let's tackle this problem. The patient is a 62-year-old with a history of deep venous thrombosis enrolled in a clinical trial for a new oral anticoagulant. The goal is to determine the maintenance dose every 8 hours to achieve a plasma concentration of 15 mg/L. 

First, I need to recall pharmacokinetic principles here. The key parameters given are bioavailability (50%), half-life (2 hours), and volume of distribution (14.3 liters). The question is about calculating the maintenance dose for a target concentration. 

Maintenance dose calculations often involve the formula for steady-state concentration. Since the dosing interval is every 8 hours, and the half-life is 2 hours, that means each dose is given after 4 half-lives (since half-life is 2h, 8h is 4 half-lives). But wait, actually, the dosing interval (τ) is 8 hours, and the half-life (t½) is 2 hours. The ratio τ/t½ is 8/2 = 4. This is important because it determines the accumulation factor and how the drug is eliminated between doses.

The formula for the maintenance dose (D) to achieve a desired plasma concentration (Css) is derived from the steady-state equation. The formula is: 

D = (Css × Vd × CL × τ) / (F × (1 - e^(-kt))) 

Wait, maybe a simpler approach. Alternatively, since it's an oral drug with bioavailability (F), the formula can be approached using the target concentration and the pharmacokinetic parameters.

Alternatively, the maintenance dose can be calculated using the equation:

Dose = (Desired concentration × Volume of distribution × Clearance × Dosing interval) / (Bioavailability × (1 - e^(-k × τ)))

But I need to recall the exact formula. Let me think again.

First, clearance (CL) can be calculated from the half-life and volume of distribution. The formula for half-life (t½) is ln(2)/ke, where ke is the elimination rate constant. So, ke = ln(2)/t½.

Given t½ is 2 hours, so ke = 0.693 / 2 ≈ 0.3465 per hour.

Then, CL = ke × Vd. Since Vd is 14.3 liters,

CL = 0.3465 * 14.3 ≈ 4.94 L/h.

Now, the desired steady-state concentration (Css) is 15 mg/L. The formula for the maintenance dose (D) when dosing every τ hours is:

D = (Css × Vd × CL × τ) / (F × (1 - e^(-ke × τ))) 

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me see. Alternatively, the formula can be simplified when the dosing interval is a multiple of the half-life. Since τ is 8 hours and t½ is 2 hours, τ is 4 half-lives. In such cases, the accumulation factor approaches (1 - e^(-kt))/(1 - e^(-kτ)), but maybe there's a simpler way here.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for multiple dosing is:

Css = (D × F × (ke × Vd) ) / (CL × (1 - e^(-ke × τ))) ) × (1/e^(ke × (τ - t)) - 1/e^(ke × τ)) ?

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's try using the formula for a drug administered orally with bioavailability F. The steady-state concentration can be calculated as:

Css = (D × F × ke) / (CL × (1 - e^(-ke × τ))) 

Wait, perhaps that's better. Let me check the standard formula.

The steady-state maximum concentration (Cmax) for oral administration is given by:

Cmax = (D × F × ke) / (Vd × (1 - e^(-ke × τ))) ) × (1/(ke × τ)) ?

Wait, maybe I should refer to the formula for the average steady-state concentration. Alternatively, since the question is asking for the dose to reach a plasma concentration of 15 mg/L, perhaps they are referring to the average concentration or trough concentration?

The problem states "plasma concentration of the drug in this patient is 15 mg/L". It might be referring to the steady-state concentration, perhaps the trough level (just before the next dose). Since the dosing interval is 8 hours, which is 4 half-lives, the drug would have almost completely cleared by the next dose. Wait, but if the half-life is 2 hours, after 8 hours, the remaining drug would be (1/2)^4 = 1/16 of the initial dose. Therefore, the trough concentration would be very low, so the maintenance dose needs to be calculated such that after administration, the peak is sufficient but considering the elimination over the dosing interval.

Alternatively, maybe the question is simplifying and assuming that the concentration is maintained at 15 mg/L throughout, so perhaps using the average steady-state concentration?

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the loading dose, but since this is maintenance, maybe using the formula for the dose required to reach a certain concentration.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a simplified approach where the dose is calculated based on the desired concentration multiplied by the volume of distribution, adjusted for bioavailability and the dosing interval.

Wait, let me think again.

The volume of distribution (Vd) is 14.3 L. The desired concentration is 15 mg/L. So, the total amount of drug needed in the body at steady state is C × Vd = 15 mg/L * 14.3 L = 214.5 mg.

However, since the drug is given every 8 hours, each dose must replace the amount eliminated in those 8 hours, but also, due to elimination, the total amount in the body will decrease over the interval. Wait, perhaps this is the approach for a continuous infusion, but since it's intermittent dosing, maybe we need to consider the dosing interval and elimination rate.

Alternatively, using the formula for maintenance dose in intermittent dosing:

D = (Css × Vd × CL × τ) / (F × (1 - e^(-kt)))

Wait, let me write down all the variables:

- Css = 15 mg/L

- Vd =14.3 L

- t½ = 2h, so ke = ln(2)/2 ≈0.3466 h⁻¹

- CL = ke * Vd = 0.3466 *14.3 ≈4.94 L/h

- τ (dosing interval) =8h

- F (bioavailability)=0.5

So plug into the formula:

D = (15 mg/L *14.3 L *4.94 L/h *8h) / (0.5*(1 - e^(-0.3466*8)))

First, compute denominator: 1 - e^(-0.3466*8). Let's compute exponent: 0.3466*8 ≈2.773. So e^-2.773 ≈0.0625 (since e^-2.773 is about 1/16 because e^-2.7726 is 1/16). So 1 - 0.0625 =0.9375. So denominator is 0.5*0.9375 =0.46875

Numerator: 15*14.3=214.5; 214.5*4.94≈214.5*5≈1072.5 but subtract 214.5*0.06≈12.87, so approx 1072.5-12.87≈1059.63. Then multiply by 8: 1059.63 *8≈8477.04.

So numerator is approx 8477.04. Divide by denominator 0.46875:

8477.04 /0.46875 ≈ let's see: 8477 divided by 0.46875. Since 0.46875 is 15/32, so dividing by 15/32 is multiplying by 32/15. 8477 *32 ≈271,264; divided by15≈18,084. So approximately 18,084 mg. But that can't be right because the options are way smaller. Wait, this must be wrong. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the formula. Let me check again. The formula for the maintenance dose when given orally is:

D = (Css * Vd * CL * τ) / (F * (1 - e^(-ke*τ)))

Wait, but CL is ke * Vd, so CL = ke * Vd. Therefore, substituting CL into the equation:

D = (Css * Vd * (ke * Vd) * τ) / (F * (1 - e^(-ke*τ)))

Wait, that would be Css * Vd² * ke * τ / (F*(1 - e^(-keτ))) which seems too big. So maybe that's not the correct formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

The maintenance dose can be calculated using:

D = (Css * Vd * ke * τ) / (F * (1 - e^(-ke*τ)))

Because CL = ke * Vd, so substituting CL:

Wait, let's see another approach. The steady-state concentration at the peak (Cmax) after repeated dosing is given by:

Cmax = (D * F * (ke * Vd)) / (Vd * (ke * τ) * (1 - e^(-ke*τ))) )

Hmm, maybe I need to look up the exact formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the maintenance dose is:

D = (Css * Vd * CL * τ) / (F * (1 - e^(-CL/ Vd * τ)) )

Wait, CL/Vd is ke, so that term is ke*τ. 

Alternatively, let's think in terms of the dosing interval. Since the half-life is 2 hours, every 8 hours is 4 half-lives. The drug's elimination over 8 hours would be (1/2)^4 = 1/16 remaining. So, each dose must compensate for the loss over the interval.

Alternatively, using the formula for the dose required to maintain a certain concentration when given every τ hours:

The amount of drug eliminated in one dosing interval (τ) is CL * τ. The desired concentration is Css, so the total drug in the body at steady state should be Css * Vd. Since each dose contributes D*F (because bioavailability is 50%) to the systemic circulation, but over the dosing interval, the drug is eliminated. The formula for the maintenance dose is:

D * F = (Css * Vd * ke) / (1 - e^(-ke*τ))

Wait, maybe this is better. Let me see:

The steady-state concentration is maintained when the amount administered each dose equals the amount eliminated over the dosing interval.

The elimination over τ is CL * τ (since CL is volume per time), but CL = ke * Vd, so:

Elimination over τ is ke * Vd * τ. 

The amount in the body at steady state is Css * Vd. 

Wait, perhaps the maintenance dose is such that each dose (adjusted for bioavailability) replaces the amount eliminated over the interval. So:

D * F = (Css * Vd * ke) / (1 - e^(-ke*τ))

Wait, let me think again. The formula for the maintenance dose when administering every τ hours is:

D = (Css * Vd * ke * τ) / (F * (1 - e^(-ke*τ))) 

Wait, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me try plugging in the numbers step by step.

Alternatively, let me try to compute the dosing using the following approach:

The desired concentration is 15 mg/L. The volume of distribution is 14.3 L, so the total amount in the body needed is 15 *14.3 = 214.5 mg.

However, since the drug is given every 8 hours, the elimination over those 8 hours must be accounted for. The half-life is 2 hours, so over 8 hours, the amount remaining from the previous dose is (1/2)^(8/2) = 1/16. 

Therefore, each dose must supply the amount that is eliminated plus the remaining. But since it's steady state, the total amount after each dose should remain the same. Let me think of it as:

At steady state, just before dosing (trough concentration), the amount is A. After administration, the amount becomes A + D*F (since bioavailability is 50%, so D*0.5). Then, over the next 8 hours, it decays to A again. 

So the equation is:

A + D*F * e^(-ke*τ) = A 

Wait, no. Wait, the amount after administration is (A + D*F), and then over τ hours, it's reduced by elimination. The amount remaining after τ hours is (A + D*F) * e^(-ke*τ). This should equal the trough amount A. 

So:

(A + D*F) * e^(-ke*τ) = A 

Solving for D:

A + D*F = A * e^(ke*τ)

D*F = A (e^(ke*τ) -1 )

Therefore:

D = [A (e^(ke*τ) -1 )]/ (F )

But we need to express A in terms of the desired concentration. The trough concentration A/Vd = Css_trough. But the problem states the desired plasma concentration is 15 mg/L. If they are referring to the trough concentration (the minimum before the next dose), then A = 15 mg/L * Vd. 

Alternatively, if they want the peak concentration, then the peak would be higher. But the question isn't clear. However, perhaps the question is assuming that the concentration should be maintained at 15 mg/L throughout, which would be the case if it's an average concentration. Alternatively, maybe it's the trough concentration.

Assuming that 15 mg/L is the trough concentration (A), then:

A = 15 *14.3 =214.5 mg.

Plugging into the equation:

D = (214.5 * (e^(ke*τ) -1 )) / (0.5 )

Compute ke*τ: 0.3466 *8 ≈2.773

e^2.773 is approximately e^2.7726 ≈16 (since ln(16)=2.7726). So e^2.773 ≈16.005. 

Therefore, e^(ke*τ) -1 ≈15.005.

Thus:

D = (214.5 *15.005)/0.5 ≈ (214.5 *15.005)/0.5

Calculate numerator: 214.5 *15 ≈3217.5, plus 214.5*0.005≈1.07, total≈3218.57

Divide by 0.5 gives 6437.14 mg. That's way too high (the options go up to 3600). So that can't be right. 

Hmm, maybe I made a wrong assumption here. Perhaps the question assumes that the desired concentration is the peak concentration. Let's try that.

If the peak concentration (Cmax) is 15 mg/L, then the amount immediately after dosing is A + D*F = Cmax * Vd =15 *14.3 =214.5 mg.

But the previous trough was A, and after dosing, it becomes A + D*F. Then over the interval, it decays to A again. 

Wait, but in that case, the equation would be:

(A + D*F) * e^(-ke*τ) = A 

So rearranged:

D*F = A (1/e^(-ke*τ) -1 )

Wait, no. Let me re-derive:

Starting with the equation:

(A + D*F) * e^(-ke*τ) = A 

Therefore,

A + D*F = A * e^(ke*τ)

So,

D*F = A (e^(ke*τ) -1 )

If instead, the desired concentration is the peak (Cmax =15 mg/L), then the peak is (A_prev + D*F)/Vd = Cmax. So A_prev + D*F = Cmax * Vd. 

But at steady state, the previous trough A_prev is equal to A (the trough before the dose). So the equation is:

(A + D*F) * e^(-ke*τ) = A 

And also, the peak is (A + D*F)/Vd = Cmax =15 mg/L. 

Thus, A + D*F = 15 *14.3 =214.5 mg. 

Substituting into the first equation:

214.5 * e^(-ke*τ) = A 

But from the first equation, A = (D*F)/(e^(ke*τ) -1 )

Wait, this is getting too tangled. Let me try substituting.

From the peak equation: A + D*F =214.5 

From the steady state equation: (A + D*F)*e^(-ke*τ) = A 

Substitute A + D*F =214.5 into the second equation:

214.5 * e^(-ke*τ) = A 

Therefore, A =214.5 * e^(-ke*τ)

Substitute back into the first equation:

214.5 = A + D*F 

But A =214.5 * e^(-ke*τ), so:

214.5 =214.5 * e^(-ke*τ) + D*F 

Then,

D*F =214.5 (1 - e^(-ke*τ)) 

Thus,

D = [214.5 (1 - e^(-ke*τ)) ] / F 

Plugging in the numbers:

ke*τ is 0.3466 *8≈2.773 

e^(-2.773)≈1/16 (since e^-2.7726≈1/16). So 1 - e^(-2.773)=1 - 0.0625≈0.9375 

Thus,

D = (214.5 *0.9375)/0.5 

Calculate numerator: 214.5 *0.9375. Let's compute:

214.5 * 0.9 =193.05

214.5 *0.0375=8.04375

Total ≈193.05+8.04375≈201.09375

Divide by 0.5: 201.09375 /0.5=402.1875 mg. 

Hmm, that's approximately 402 mg. But the options are 150, 430, 600, etc. So the closest is option 2 (430 mg). 

Wait, that seems plausible. Let me check my steps again.

Wait, if the desired Cmax is 15 mg/L, then the calculation leads to ~402 mg, which rounds to 430 mg (option 2). Alternatively, maybe they're using Cavg instead?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the average steady-state concentration. The average concentration (Cavg) in a dosing interval is (Cmax + Cmin)/2. If they want Cavg to be 15 mg/L, then the Cmax would be higher. But without knowing whether it's Cmax, Cavg, or trough, it's a bit ambiguous. However, in clinical dosing scenarios, often the target is the trough concentration to avoid toxicity, but here it just says "plasma concentration", which might imply the desired level is maintained throughout, so perhaps the average?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a simplified formula where the maintenance dose is calculated as:

D = (Css × Vd × CL × τ) / (F × (1 - e^(-CL / Vd × τ)))

Wait, CL/Vd is ke, so that's the same as before. Let me try with the numbers again:

CL =4.94 L/h (from earlier calculation)

So CL × τ =4.94 *8≈39.52 L

Vd is 14.3 L. 

Wait, maybe the formula is different. Let's think of the steady-state concentration for an oral drug with bioavailability F:

Css = (D * F * ke) / (CL * (1 - e^(-ke*τ))) 

We can rearrange this to solve for D:

D = (Css * CL * (1 - e^(-ke*τ))) / (F * ke)

Wait, let's plug in the numbers:

Css =15 mg/L

CL=4.94 L/h

ke=0.3466 h⁻¹

τ=8h

So:

D = (15 *4.94 * (1 - e^(-0.3466*8))) / (0.5 *0.3466)

First compute exponent: 0.3466*8≈2.773, so e^-2.773≈0.0625. Thus 1 -0.0625=0.9375.

So numerator:15*4.94*0.9375

15*4.94 =74.1, then 74.1 *0.9375 ≈74.1*0.9=66.69 +74.1*0.0375≈2.78≈69.47

Denominator:0.5 *0.3466≈0.1733

Thus D≈69.47 /0.
