Case_id: case_914
Case_description: 
A 27-year-old graduate student is bitten by a coral snake while he was hiking alone through the woods and dies 2 hours later from respiratory failure. His body was discovered 7 hours later by a group of campers who promptly called the police. On arrival, the police found his body to be cold and stiff. Which of the following processes is responsible for the rigidity observed?
Options: 
1. Activation of muscle contraction by neurotoxins
2. Reduced affinity of myosin head for actin filament
3. Effect of low temperature on muscle proteins
4. Inhibition of cross-bridge cycling
5. Depletion of intracellular calcium
Correct Answer: Inhibition of cross-bridge cycling

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** A 27-year-old male graduate student.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Bitten by a coral snake while hiking alone.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - Rapid onset of symptoms leading to death within 2 hours post-bite due to respiratory failure.  
  - Upon discovery 7 hours after death, the body was observed to be cold and stiff.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline:** The patient succumbed to respiratory failure within 2 hours of the coral snake bite. The body was discovered 7 hours post-mortem with rigidity.  
- **Characteristics of Symptoms:**  
  - **Respiratory Failure:** Indicative of neuromuscular paralysis caused by coral snake neurotoxins, which block neuromuscular transmission leading to muscle paralysis, including the diaphragm.  
  - **Rigidity (Stiffness):** The stiffness observed is characteristic of rigor mortis, a postmortem change resulting from biochemical processes in muscle tissue after death.  
- **Interrelationships:** The rapid onset of paralysis led to death, and the subsequent rigidity is a natural postmortem phenomenon rather than a direct effect of the venom.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Activation of muscle contraction by neurotoxins**  
  Coral snake neurotoxins primarily cause neuromuscular blockade leading to paralysis rather than sustained muscle contraction. Thus, this option does not align with the observed rigidity.  

- **Option 2: Reduced affinity of myosin head for actin filament**  
  This would result in decreased muscle contraction efficiency, not rigidity. It does not explain the postmortem stiffness observed.  

- **Option 3: Effect of low temperature on muscle proteins**  
  While the body was found cold, low temperature alone does not cause muscle rigidity. It may slow biochemical processes but is not the primary cause of rigor mortis.  

- **Option 4: Inhibition of cross-bridge cycling**  
  After death, ATP levels deplete, preventing the detachment of myosin heads from actin filaments, thereby inhibiting cross-bridge cycling. This results in sustained muscle contraction and rigidity characteristic of rigor mortis. This aligns with the stiffness observed in the patient's body.  

- **Option 5: Depletion of intracellular calcium**  
  Decreased calcium levels would impair muscle contraction but do not directly cause muscle rigidity postmortem.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Inhibition of cross-bridge cycling)(抑制交叉桥循环)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 4 (Inhibition of cross-bridge cycling)

Qwen's full response:

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
A 27-year-old male died 2 hours after a coral snake bite due to respiratory failure. His body was discovered 7 hours postmortem, with coldness and stiffness noted. The key clinical manifestation is the rigidity observed after death, which must be differentiated from antemortem effects of the snake venom.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline**: Death occurred 2 hours post-bite, with rigor mortis observed 7 hours postmortem.  
- **Snake Venom Mechanism**: Coral snake neurotoxins (e.g., alpha-neurotoxins) typically cause neuromuscular paralysis by blocking acetylcholine receptors, leading to flaccid muscle weakness, not rigidity. Respiratory failure in this case aligns with neuromuscular paralysis.  
- **Rigidity Origin**: The stiffness noted 7 hours postmortem is consistent with **rigor mortis**, a biochemical process occurring after ATP depletion post death, not antemortem toxin effects.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Activation of muscle contraction by neurotoxins**: Unlikely. Coral snake venom causes neuromuscular paralysis, not sustained contraction. Rigidity here is postmortem.  
2. **Reduced affinity of myosin head for actin filament**: This would lead to muscle relaxation, not rigidity.  
3. **Effect of low temperature on muscle proteins**: While postmortem cooling contributes to biochemical changes, rigor mortis is primarily due to ATP depletion, not temperature alone.  
4. **Inhibition of cross-bridge cycling**: Correct. ATP depletion post death prevents myosin heads from detaching from actin, locking cross-bridges and causing rigidity. This is the mechanism of rigor mortis.  
5. **Depletion of intracellular calcium**: Calcium is required for muscle contraction. Its depletion would cause flaccidity, not rigidity.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The rigidity observed is rigor mortis, directly caused by the inhibition of cross-bridge cycling due to ATP depletion after death.  

**My final selection is: Option 4 (Inhibition of cross-bridge cycling)(抑制横桥循环)**

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 4 (Inhibition of cross-bridge cycling)

DeepSeek's full response:

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 27-year-old male graduate student.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Death following a coral snake bite during hiking.  
- **Key Symptoms**:  
  - Death occurred 2 hours post-bite due to respiratory failure.  
  - Body found 7 hours later with coldness and rigidity (stiffness).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline**:  
  - Coral snake bite → rapid respiratory failure (2 hours) → death → body discovered 7 hours later with rigidity.  
- **Critical Observations**:  
  - **Rigidity**: Observed 7 hours postmortem, consistent with rigor mortis (typically begins 2–6 hours after death).  
  - **Coldness**: Reflects environmental cooling (algor mortis), unrelated to muscle rigidity.  
- **Key Mechanism**:  
  - Coral snake neurotoxins (e.g., α-neurotoxins) block neuromuscular transmission, causing paralysis and respiratory failure. However, neurotoxins do not directly induce sustained muscle rigidity.  
  - Rigor mortis arises from **ATP depletion**, preventing myosin-actin cross-bridge detachment.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Activation of muscle contraction by neurotoxins**  
   - Neurotoxins cause flaccid paralysis (via acetylcholine receptor blockade), not sustained rigidity. Contradicts observed stiffness.  
2. **Reduced myosin-actin affinity**  
   - Would lead to muscle relaxation, not rigidity. Irrelevant to rigor mortis.  
3. **Low temperature effect on muscle proteins**  
   - Cold slows metabolic processes but does not directly cause rigidity. Rigor mortis occurs even at normal temperatures.  
4. **Inhibition of cross-bridge cycling**  
   - Directly aligns with rigor mortis: ATP depletion halts myosin detachment from actin, maintaining fixed cross-bridges. Matches timeline (rigor onset within hours).  
5. **Depletion of intracellular calcium**  
   - Postmortem calcium leakage initiates contraction (via calcium-troponin interaction), but ATP depletion (not calcium loss) sustains rigidity.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Inhibition of cross-bridge cycling)(横桥循环的抑制)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Rigor mortis is caused by ATP depletion, preventing myosin heads from detaching from actin filaments.  
  - Observed rigidity aligns with the timeline of rigor mortis (7 hours postmortem), unrelated to neurotoxins or environmental factors.
