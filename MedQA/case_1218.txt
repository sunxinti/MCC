**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**

- **Patient Information:**  
  - **Age & Ethnicity:** 56-year-old man of Korean descent  
  - **Medical History:** Type-2 diabetes mellitus (controlled with oral medications), cigarette smoking, sedentary lifestyle  
- **Chief Complaint:** Annual health check-up  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - **Vital Signs:** Blood pressure 130/70 mm Hg, pulse 72/min, respiratory rate 18/min, body temperature 36.5°C (97.7°F)  
  - **Physical Examination:** Enlarged, nontender left supraclavicular lymph node  
  - **Other Findings:** Unremarkable

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**

- **Enlarged Left Supraclavicular Node (Virchow's Node):**  
  - **Significance:** The presence of an enlarged, nontender left supraclavicular node (known as Virchow's node) is clinically significant as it often indicates metastasis from an abdominal malignancy, most notably gastric cancer.  
- **Patient's Risk Factors:**  
  - **Smoking:** Increases the risk for lung cancer, which can also metastasize to supraclavicular nodes.  
  - **Korean Descent:** Higher prevalence of gastric cancer in East Asian populations.  
  - **Type-2 Diabetes & Sedentary Lifestyle:** Indirectly contribute to increased cancer risk.  
- **Lack of Other Symptoms:**  
  - Absence of respiratory symptoms or gastrointestinal complaints does not rule out underlying malignancies but suggests that the lymphadenopathy might be an early sign.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**

- **Option 1: Chest Radiograph**  
  - **Relevance:** Useful for detecting lung cancer, a potential primary source given the patient's smoking history.  
  - **Limitations:** May not identify abdominal malignancies responsible for Virchow's node.  
- **Option 2: Upper Gastointestinal Endoscopy**  
  - **Relevance:** Directly evaluates the stomach for primary gastric malignancies, which are strongly associated with left supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, especially in Korean populations where gastric cancer prevalence is high.  
  - **Advantages:** High diagnostic yield for detecting gastric cancer, aligning with the patient's clinical presentation.  
- **Option 3: Computed Tomography of Head and Neck**  
  - **Relevance:** More suitable for local head and neck pathologies; less likely to identify abdominal primaries.  
- **Option 4: Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain**  
  - **Relevance:** Least likely to be relevant in this context; no neurological symptoms present.  
- **Option 5: Ultrasound of the Neck**  
  - **Relevance:** Useful for characterizing the lymph node but does not assist in identifying the primary malignancy.

**4. Final Selection**

**My final selection is: Option 2 (Upper gastointestinal endoscopy) (上胃肠内窥镜检查)**

Qwen is reasoning the answer...

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 2 (Upper gastointestinal endoscopy)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient demographics**: 56-year-old Korean male with a history of smoking, sedentary lifestyle, and well-controlled type-2 diabetes.  
- **Chief complaint**: Annual health check-up.  
- **Key clinical findings**: Enlarged, nontender left supraclavicular lymph node. All other vital signs and physical examination findings are unremarkable.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- The **left supraclavicular lymph node enlargement** is the most critical finding. This node is often referred to as the "Virchow node" and is a classic sign of metastatic malignancy, particularly from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (e.g., gastric cancer) or lung cancer.  
- The patient’s smoking history increases the risk of lung cancer, while his Korean ethnicity and gender raise the likelihood of gastric cancer (gastric cancer has a higher incidence in East Asian populations).  
- The nontender nature of the lymph node suggests a chronic or malignant process rather than an infectious cause (e.g., tuberculosis or reactive lymphadenitis).  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (Chest radiograph)**: A chest X-ray can identify pulmonary causes (e.g., lung cancer, metastases) but has limited sensitivity for small tumors or early-stage disease. It is a reasonable initial step but may miss GI tract malignancies.  
- **Option 2 (Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy)**: This is critical for evaluating the GI tract, as gastric or esophageal cancer commonly metastasizes to the left supraclavicular lymph nodes. Endoscopy allows direct visualization and biopsy of suspected lesions, making it the most targeted investigation for this clinical scenario.  
- **Option 3 (Computed tomography of head and neck)**: Less relevant unless there is suspicion of head/neck primary tumors (e.g., thyroid, oral cavity), which is less likely given the lymph node’s location and the patient’s risk factors.  
- **Option 4 (Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain)**: Unnecessary, as brain involvement is not directly linked to supraclavicular lymphadenopathy in this context.  
- **Option 5 (Ultrasound of the neck)**: Can characterize the lymph node (e.g., size, morphology) but does not address the underlying primary tumor. It is supplementary but insufficient alone.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Upper gastointestinal endoscopy)(上消化道内镜)**  
- **Key evidence**: Left supraclavicular lymphadenopathy (Virchow node) is strongly associated with gastric cancer metastasis, which is prevalent in this patient’s demographic and risk profile. Upper GI endoscopy directly evaluates the stomach and esophagus, enabling early detection of malignancies and biopsy confirmation. Other options, such as a chest X-ray, are less specific for identifying the primary tumor in this scenario.

DeepSeek is reasoning the answer...

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 2 (Upper gastointestinal endoscopy)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 56-year-old Korean man with a history of smoking, sedentary lifestyle, and controlled type-2 diabetes presents for a routine check-up.  
- Key clinical finding: **enlarged, nontender left supraclavicular lymph node**. No other significant symptoms or signs.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- Left supraclavicular lymphadenopathy (Virchow’s node) is strongly associated with metastatic malignancies, particularly thoracic (e.g., lung) or abdominal (e.g., gastric) cancers.  
- The patient’s smoking history increases lung cancer risk, while his Korean ethnicity elevates gastric cancer risk (higher prevalence in East Asian populations).  
- The node’s nontender, firm nature suggests malignancy rather than infection or reactive hyperplasia.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Chest radiograph (Option 1)**:  
   - Relevant for detecting lung masses in a smoker but less sensitive than CT.  
   - Does not directly evaluate abdominal primaries (e.g., gastric cancer).  

2. **Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (Option 2)**:  
   - Critical for assessing gastric cancer, a leading cause of Virchow’s node in high-risk populations.  
   - Asymptomatic gastric cancer is common, justifying endoscopy despite lack of GI symptoms.  

3. **CT head and neck (Option 3)**:  
   - Less relevant, as supraclavicular nodes typically drain infraclavicular regions (thorax/abdomen), not head/neck primaries.  

4. **MRI brain (Option 4)**:  
   - Unnecessary without neurological symptoms.  

5. **Ultrasound of the neck (Option 5)**:  
   - Redundant if biopsy/FNA is already planned; adds limited diagnostic value for primary site identification.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy)(上消化道内窥镜检查)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  1. Left supraclavicular lymphadenopathy classically correlates with gastric cancer metastasis, especially in East Asian populations.  
  2. Asymptomatic gastric cancer is prevalent in high-risk groups, necessitating endoscopic evaluation.  
  3. Smoking history and ethnicity collectively prioritize ruling out gastric malignancy alongside lung pathology (chest radiograph is less definitive for abdominal primaries).
