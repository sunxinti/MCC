Case_description: 
On routine screening, a 62-year-old man is found to have positive fecal occult blood tests. He is asymptomatic, but his father died of large intestinal cancer. Abdominal and rectal exams are normal. A colonoscopy subsequently reveals a polyp in the descending colon but no other abnormalities. Excisional biopsy of the polyp shows 75% tubular architecture. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options: 
1. Inflammatory polyp
2. Adenomatous polyp
3. Hamartomatous polyp
4. Colorectal cancer
5. Hemorrhoids

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**
- **Patient Information:** A 62-year-old man undergoing routine health screening.
- **Chief Complaint:** Positive fecal occult blood tests (FOBT).
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**
  - Asymptomatic with no gastrointestinal symptoms.
  - Family history significant for large intestinal cancer (father).
  - Normal abdominal and rectal examinations.
  - Colonoscopy findings: A single polyp located in the descending colon with no other abnormalities.
  - Histopathology of the polyp: 75% tubular architecture.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**
- **Positive FOBT:** Indicates the presence of occult (hidden) blood in the stool, which can be a sign of colorectal neoplasia, including polyps or cancer.
- **Family History:** A first-degree relative (father) with large intestinal cancer increases the patient's risk for colorectal neoplasms.
- **Colonoscopy Findings:** The presence of a polyp raises concern for potential malignancy, especially given the family history.
- **Histopathology – Tubular Architecture (75%):** Tubular adenomas are characterized by glandular structures and are considered benign but have malignant potential, especially with larger size and villous features.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**
1. **Inflammatory Polyp (Option 1):**
   - Typically associated with inflammatory bowel diseases like ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease.
   - Usually presents with symptoms such as abdominal pain or bleeding.
   - Histologically characterized by inflammatory cells rather than tubular architecture.
   - **Less likely** given the absence of inflammatory symptoms and specific histological features.

2. **Adenomatous Polyp (Option 2):**
   - Benign neoplastic polyps with potential for malignant transformation.
   - Histologically, tubular adenomas are the most common type, characterized by glandular (tubular) structures.
   - Family history of colorectal cancer further supports this diagnosis.
   - **Highly likely** given the histological finding of 75% tubular architecture and the patient's risk factors.

3. **Hamartomatous Polyp (Option 3):**
   - Associated with syndromes like Peutz-Jeghers or juvenile polyposis.
   - Composed of disorganized normal tissue elements.
   - Typically benign with a lower risk of malignancy compared to adenomatous polyps.
   - **Less likely** due to absence of syndromic features and specific histological pattern.

4. **Colorectal Cancer (Option 4):**
   - Represents malignant transformation of polyps, especially adenomatous types.
   - Typically presents with symptoms like changes in bowel habits, weight loss, or bleeding.
   - Histologically would show invasive malignant cells, not just tubular architecture.
   - **Less likely** as the patient is asymptomatic and the histology indicates a benign adenoma.

5. **Hemorrhoids (Option 5):**
   - Vascular structures that can prolapse and bleed, typically presenting with rectal bleeding.
   - Diagnosed through physical examination, visible during rectal exam.
   - **Unrelated** to polyp findings on colonoscopy and histological features.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Adenomatous polyp)(腺瘤性息肉)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 2 (Adenomatous polyp)

Qwen's full response:

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 62-year-old asymptomatic man with a positive fecal occult blood test and a family history of colorectal cancer (father died of large intestinal cancer).  
- Abdominal and rectal exams were normal. Colonoscopy revealed a solitary polyp in the descending colon. Biopsy showed 75% tubular architecture.  

**Key symptoms**: Asymptomatic presentation, positive fecal occult blood test, family history of colorectal cancer, solitary polyp with tubular histology.  

---

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Family history**: The father’s death from colorectal cancer increases the patient’s risk for hereditary colorectal neoplasms, such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) or sporadic adenomas.  
- **Asymptomatic presentation**: The absence of symptoms (e.g., bleeding, pain, altered bowel habits) suggests the polyp is benign, but screening findings (fecal occult blood test) highlight the need for evaluation.  
- **Polyp histology**: The biopsy showing 75% tubular architecture is critical. Tubular adenomas typically exhibit glandular structures with minimal dysplasia, aligning with this description.  
- **Solitary polyp**: Most adenomas are solitary, whereas inflammatory or hamartomatous polyps are often multiple or associated with specific conditions (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease or Peutz-Jeghers syndrome).  

---

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Inflammatory polyp**: Typically small, multiple, and associated with chronic inflammation (e.g., ulcerative colitis). The solitary nature and tubular histology here do not support this.  
2. **Adenomatous polyp**: Strongly supported by the histology (tubular architecture) and risk factors (age, family history). Adenomas are precursors to colorectal cancer and are common in screening populations.  
3. **Hamartomatous polyp**: Often part of syndromes like Peutz-Jeghers or juvenile polyposis. These polyps contain multiple tissue types (e.g., smooth muscle, glands) and are rarely solitary with tubular features.  
4. **Colorectal cancer**: Excluded because the biopsy describes a polyp with tubular architecture, not invasive cancer.  
5. **Hemorrhoids**: Located in the rectum/anal canal and typically symptomatic (e.g., bleeding, prolapse). The polyp’s location in the descending colon rules this out.  

---

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Adenomatous polyp)(腺瘤性息肉)**  

**Key evidence**:  
- The histological description of **75% tubular architecture** is characteristic of tubular adenomas.  
- The patient’s age, family history of colorectal cancer, and asymptomatic presentation align with sporadic adenomatous polyps, which are precancerous lesions.  
- Other options are inconsistent with the solitary polyp, tubular histology, and lack of clinical features (e.g., inflammation, syndromic features, or invasive cancer).

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 2 (Adenomatous polyp)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Profile:** 62-year-old man, asymptomatic, family history of paternal death due to large intestinal cancer.  
- **Key Findings:** Positive fecal occult blood test (routine screening), normal abdominal/rectal exams, colonoscopy revealing a solitary polyp in the descending colon.  
- **Biopsy Result:** Polyp with 75% tubular architecture.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Positive Fecal Occult Blood:** Suggests gastrointestinal bleeding, but asymptomatic nature and normal exams localize the source to the colon.  
- **Family History:** Increased risk for colorectal neoplasia (e.g., adenomatous polyps or cancer).  
- **Polyp Morphology:** Tubular architecture (75%) aligns with adenomatous polyps, which are premalignant lesions.  
- **Opposing Features:**  
  - **Inflammatory polyp:** Typically associated with mucosal inflammation (absent here).  
  - **Hemorrhoids:** Rectal exam normal, and colonoscopy identified a polyp as the bleeding source.  
  - **Colorectal cancer:** Requires invasion beyond the mucosa; biopsy did not report malignancy.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Inflammatory polyp (炎症性息肉):** Unlikely due to lack of inflammation history/endoscopic signs (e.g., ulceration, erythema).  
2. **Adenomatous polyp (腺瘤性息肉):** Strongly supported by tubular architecture (hallmark of tubular adenoma), family history, and occult blood.  
3. **Hamartomatous polyp (错构瘤性息肉):** Typically seen in syndromic contexts (e.g., Peutz-Jeghers), absent here.  
4. **Colorectal cancer (结直肠癌):** Excluded by biopsy showing no malignancy (e.g., submucosal invasion).  
5. **Hemorrhoids (痔疮):** Rectal exam normal; colonoscopy identified a proximal polyp as the bleeding source.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Adenomatous polyp)(腺瘤性息肉)**  
- **Key Evidence:**  
  - Tubular architecture (75%) on biopsy is diagnostic of tubular adenoma.  
  - Adenomatous polyps are the most common premalignant colonic polyps and align with occult bleeding and family history.  
  - Absence of malignancy on biopsy excludes colorectal cancer.
