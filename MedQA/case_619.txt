**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** 43-year-old woman with obesity.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Greasy diarrhea, excessive belching, flatulence, and progressively worsening night-time vision.  
- **Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - **Gastrointestinal Symptoms:** Greasy diarrhea, excessive belching, flatulence.  
  - **Ophthalmic Symptom:** Worsening night-time vision.  
  - **Dermatological Signs:** Dry, scaly skin on extremities and face.  
- **Timeline:** Symptoms began eight weeks after initiating a new weight-loss medication.  
- **Absence of Symptoms:** No fever, chills, or vomiting.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Gastrointestinal Symptoms:** Greasy diarrhea, belching, and flatulence suggest malabsorption or increased fat excretion.  
- **Ophthalmic Symptom:** Worsening night-time vision may indicate vitamin A deficiency, which affects the retina and can lead to night blindness.  
- **Dermatological Signs:** Dry, scaly skin is consistent with deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamins, particularly vitamin A.  
- **Timeline Correlation:** The onset of symptoms eight weeks after starting the medication indicates a likely side effect related to the drug's mechanism of action.  
- **Interrelationship:** Inhibition of fat absorption can lead to fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies (A, D, E, K), explaining both the gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Stimulation of monoamine neurotransmitter release**  
  - **Mechanism:** Typically related to appetite suppression (e.g., amphetamine-like drugs).  
  - **Clinical Alignment:** While such drugs can cause dry skin and possibly vision issues, they are less likely to cause greasy diarrhea and fat malabsorption.  
  - **Conclusion:** Less consistent with the presented symptoms.
  
- **Option 2: Inhibition of serotonin reuptake**  
  - **Mechanism:** Associated with antidepressants like SSRIs, not primarily used for weight loss.  
  - **Clinical Alignment:** Does not explain the gastrointestinal and vitamin deficiency symptoms.  
  - **Conclusion:** Unlikely relevant to this case.
  
- **Option 3: Stimulation of norepinephrine release**  
  - **Mechanism:** Similar to monoamine release, used in some weight-loss agents.  
  - **Clinical Alignment:** May cause side effects like dry skin but not specifically greasy diarrhea or vitamin deficiencies.  
  - **Conclusion:** Partially aligns but incomplete explanation.
  
- **Option 4: Inhibition of lipase**  
  - **Mechanism:** Drugs like orlistat inhibit pancreatic lipase, reducing fat absorption.  
  - **Clinical Alignment:** Directly causes gastrointestinal side effects like greasy diarrhea, belching, and flatulence. Additionally, reduced fat absorption leads to deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamins, explaining night-time vision worsening (vitamin A deficiency) and dry, scaly skin.  
  - **Conclusion:** Highly consistent with all presented symptoms.
  
- **Option 5: Secretion of glucose-dependent insulin**  
  - **Mechanism:** Related to insulin secretion, used in diabetes management rather than weight loss.  
  - **Clinical Alignment:** Does not account for gastrointestinal or vitamin deficiency symptoms.  
  - **Conclusion:** Not relevant to this case.

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient:** 43-year-old woman with obesity on a new weight-loss medication for 8 weeks.  
- **Chief Complaints:** Greasy diarrhea, excessive belching, flatulence, and progressive night-time vision loss.  
- **Physical Findings:** Dry, scaly skin on extremities and face.  
- **Decisive Symptoms:** **Greasy diarrhea** (malabsorption marker), **night vision deterioration** (vitamin A deficiency), and **skin changes** (consistent with fat-soluble vitamin deficiency).  

---

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline:** Symptoms emerged gradually over 8 weeks of medication use, aligning with the drug’s mechanism.  
- **Key Features:**  
  - **Greasy diarrhea:** Suggests impaired fat digestion/absorption.  
  - **Night vision loss:** Classic sign of vitamin A deficiency, which requires fat for absorption.  
  - **Skin changes:** Dry, scaly skin is a hallmark of fat malabsorption (e.g., vitamin A/E deficiency).  
- **Exclusion:** No fever, chills, or vomiting rules out infectious/inflammatory processes.  

---

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (Stimulation of monoamine neurotransmitter release):**  
  - **Unlikely.** Associated with increased heart rate, hypertension, and psychiatric effects (e.g., SSRIs/ SNRIs). No such symptoms here.  
- **Option 2 (Inhibition of serotonin reuptake):**  
  - **Unlikely.** Causes nausea, diarrhea, sexual dysfunction, but not fat malabsorption or night blindness.  
- **Option 3 (Stimulation of norepinephrine release):**  
  - **Unlikely.** Leads to sympathetic overactivity (tachycardia, tremors), not fat malabsorption.  
- **Option 4 (Inhibition of lipase):**  
  - **Most Likely.** Lipase inhibitors (e.g., orlistat) block fat digestion, causing greasy stools, fat malabsorption, and deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K). Vitamin A deficiency explains night vision loss (nyctalopia) and skin changes.  
- **Option 5 (Secretion of glucose-dependent insulin):**  
  - **Unlikely.** Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists may cause diarrhea and nausea but do not impair fat absorption or cause night blindness.  

---

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Inhibition of lipase)(脂肪酶抑制)**  

**Key Evidence Supporting Choice:**  
- **Greasy diarrhea and flatulence** directly reflect undigested fat in the stool, consistent with lipase inhibition.  
- **Night vision loss and skin changes** strongly suggest vitamin A deficiency, a consequence of impaired fat absorption.  
- **Mechanism Alignment:** Lipase inhibitors (e.g., orlistat) are weight-loss drugs that block pancreatic lipase, preventing fat digestion and leading to the described symptoms.

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 43-year-old woman with obesity.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Greasy diarrhea, excessive belching, flatulence, and worsening night-time vision, occurring 8 weeks after starting a new weight-loss medication.  
- **Key Symptoms/Signs**:  
  - **Steatorrhea** (greasy diarrhea, flatulence, belching).  
  - **Night blindness** (nyctalopia) and **dry, scaly skin** (xerosis).  
  - Absence of fever, chills, or vomiting.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Steatorrhea**: Indicates fat malabsorption, often caused by impaired lipase activity or bile acid deficiency.  
- **Night Blindness**: Suggests **vitamin A deficiency**, a fat-soluble vitamin requiring proper fat absorption.  
- **Dry, Scaly Skin**: Associated with deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamins (A, E) or essential fatty acids.  
- **Timeline**: Symptoms began after starting the medication, strongly implicating a drug-induced mechanism.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Stimulation of monoamine neurotransmitter release** (e.g., phentermine): Causes appetite suppression but does not impair fat absorption. Unlikely to explain steatorrhea or vitamin deficiencies.  
2. **Inhibition of serotonin reuptake** (e.g., SSRIs): May cause diarrhea but not fat malabsorption or vitamin deficiencies.  
3. **Stimulation of norepinephrine release** (e.g., sympathomimetics): Similar to Option 1; no link to steatorrhea.  
4. **Inhibition of lipase** (e.g., orlistat): Directly blocks intestinal fat breakdown, leading to **steatorrhea** and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies (vitamin A, D, E, K). Matches all symptoms.  
5. **Secretion of glucose-dependent insulin** (e.g., GLP-1 agonists): Causes weight loss via satiety but does not affect fat absorption.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Inhibition of lipase)(脂肪酶抑制)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Steatorrhea, flatulence, and belching align with lipase inhibition causing fat malabsorption.  
  - Night blindness and xerosis indicate vitamin A deficiency secondary to impaired fat absorption.  
  - Orlistat, a lipase inhibitor, is a well-established weight-loss drug with these exact adverse effects.
