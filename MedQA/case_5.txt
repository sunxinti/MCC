**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** 39-year-old male with a 5-year history of untreated hypertension, smoking 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 5 years, and recent cocaine abuse initiated 2 weeks prior.
- **Chief Complaint:** Progressively worsening chest pain and nausea starting 30 minutes ago at a local bar.
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:** Chest pain radiating to the epigastric area, diaphoresis, marked distress.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline:** Acute onset of chest pain 30 minutes prior to presentation, with rapid worsening.
- **Characteristics of Pain:** Chest pain radiating to the epigastric region suggests cardiac origin but could also indicate gastrointestinal issues.
- **Associated Symptoms:** Nausea and diaphoresis are common in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) but also seen in other conditions like gastroesophageal reflux disease.
- **Risk Factors:** Untreated hypertension, smoking, and recent cocaine use significantly increase the risk of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and myocardial infarction.
- **Cocaine Use:** Cocaine is a potent vasoconstrictor that can lead to coronary artery spasm, thrombosis, and myocardial ischemia.
- **Absence of Findings:** No mention of arrhythmias, syncope, or neurological deficits, which might point towards other diagnoses like arrhythmic emergencies or stroke.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**

1. **Diltiazem (Option 1):**
   - **Pros:** As a calcium channel blocker, it can help in vasodilation and reduce myocardial oxygen demand.
   - **Cons:** While beneficial in vasospasm, it may not be the immediate first-line treatment in cocaine-induced chest pain.
   
2. **Labetalol (Option 2):**
   - **Pros:** It blocks both alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors, potentially useful in hypertensive emergencies.
   - **Cons:** In cocaine-induced chest pain, beta-blockers can lead to unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation, worsening vasoconstriction. Generally not recommended in this context.

3. **Nitroglycerin (Option 3):**
   - **Pros:** Acts as a potent vasodilator, reduces myocardial oxygen demand, and alleviates coronary artery vasospasm induced by cocaine. It is widely recommended as a first-line treatment in ACS and cocaine-induced chest pain.
   - **Cons:** Requires careful monitoring for hypotension, especially in the setting of cocaine use where vasoconstriction is pronounced.

4. **Propranolol (Option 4):**
   - **Pros:** Non-selective beta-blocker that can reduce heart rate and myocardial oxygen demand.
   - **Cons:** Similar to labetalol, it can cause unopposed alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulation in the presence of cocaine, potentially exacerbating vasoconstriction and hypertension. Generally contraindicated in cocaine-associated chest pain.

5. **Reassurance and Continuous Monitoring (Option 5):**
   - **Pros:** Minimally invasive, but...
   - **Cons:** Inadequate for a patient presenting with acute chest pain and high-risk features for ACS, especially with potential cocaine-induced complications. Delay in appropriate treatment can lead to adverse outcomes.

**4. Final Selection**

**My final selection is: Option 3 Nitroglycerin (硝酸甘油)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 3 (Nitroglycerin)

Qwen's full response:

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 39-year-old man presents with **progressively worsening chest pain radiating to the epigastric area**, accompanied by **nausea**, **diaphoresis**, and **marked distress**.  
- Key symptoms: Severe chest pain (epigastric radiation), nausea, diaphoresis, and acute onset in the context of cocaine use and cardiovascular risk factors.  
- Decisive features: Hypertension, smoking history, recent cocaine abuse, and acute presentation with ischemic-type symptoms.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline and Symptoms**: Symptoms began abruptly 30 minutes prior at a bar, consistent with cocaine-induced coronary vasospasm or acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Cocaine use is a strong trigger for myocardial ischemia due to its effects on catecholamines, coronary vasoconstriction, and platelet activation.  
- **Symptoms**:  
  - **Chest pain radiating to the epigastrium**: Suggests cardiac origin (e.g., myocardial ischemia) rather than gastrointestinal pathology.  
  - **Nausea and diaphoresis**: Classic accompaniments of cardiac ischemia.  
  - **Diaphoresis and marked distress**: Indicate severe pain and potential life-threatening condition.  
- **Risk Factors**:  
  - Untreated hypertension, smoking, and recent cocaine abuse (within 2 weeks) significantly elevate the risk of ACS or cocaine-induced myocardial ischemia.  
- **Absent Findings**: No mention of back pain, tearing pain, or focal neurological deficits, which would raise concern for aortic dissection or stroke.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Diltiazem (Calcium channel blocker)**  
  - **Support**: May help in coronary vasospasm (e.g., Prinzmetal’s angina) or hypertension.  
  - **Opposition**: Not first-line for acute chest pain in suspected ACS. Requires ECG confirmation of ischemia. Cocaine-induced vasoconstriction may not respond well to monotherapy.  
  - **Likelihood**: Low.  

- **Option 2: Labetalol (Alpha/beta-blocker)**  
  - **Support**: Effective for hypertensive emergencies (e.g., cocaine-induced hypertension).  
  - **Opposition**: Beta-blockers alone can worsen cocaine’s alpha-mediated vasoconstriction, but labetalol’s alpha-blocking properties mitigate this risk. However, the **primary issue is chest pain**, not hypertension.  
  - **Likelihood**: Moderate but not first-line.  

- **Option 3: Nitroglycerin**  
  - **Support**: First-line therapy for acute chest pain suspected to be cardiac in origin. Dilates coronary arteries, reduces myocardial oxygen demand, and counteracts cocaine-induced vasoconstriction.  
  - **Opposition**: Hypotension is a contraindication, but the patient’s presentation does not suggest hypotension.  
  - **Likelihood**: High.  

- **Option 4: Propranolol (Beta-blocker)**  
  - **Support**: None. Beta-blockers alone are contraindicated in cocaine-induced ischemia due to unopposed alpha-adrenergic effects, worsening vasoconstriction.  
  - **Likelihood**: Very Low.  

- **Option 5: Reassurance and Continuous Monitoring**  
  - **Support**: Inappropriate for a patient with **marked distress**, ischemic symptoms, and high-risk features. Immediate intervention is critical.  
  - **Likelihood**: Very Low.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The patient’s presentation is most consistent with **acute myocardial ischemia triggered by cocaine use**. While cocaine increases the risk of coronary vasospasm and ACS, **nitroglycerin** remains the first-line treatment for acute chest pain in suspected cardiac ischemia. It directly addresses coronary vasoconstriction and reduces myocardial workload. Labetalol could address hypertension but is secondary to immediate pain relief. Beta-blockers like propranolol are contraindicated. Reassurance is inappropriate given the severity.  

**My final selection is: Option 3 (Nitroglycerin)(硝酸甘油)**

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 3 (Nitroglycerin)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Profile**: 39-year-old man with untreated hypertension, heavy smoking, recent cocaine abuse.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Acute-onset, worsening chest pain radiating to the epigastrium, nausea, diaphoresis, and marked distress.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Cocaine use (sympathomimetic effects: increases myocardial oxygen demand, coronary vasospasm).  
  - Untreated hypertension (increases aortic dissection/ACS risk).  
  - Acute distress and diaphoresis (alarming for life-threatening conditions like ACS/aortic dissection).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline**: Symptoms began abruptly 30 minutes prior, progressing rapidly—consistent with acute cardiovascular pathology.  
- **Pain Characteristics**: Chest-to-epigastric radiation raises suspicion for ACS, but aortic dissection or cocaine-induced ischemia/spasm must be considered.  
- **Risk Factors**: Cocaine (vasoconstriction, hypertension), smoking (endothelial dysfunction), and untreated hypertension (aortic stress).  
- **Absent Findings**: No mention of tearing pain, unequal pulses, or neurologic deficits (less supportive of dissection but not exclusionary).  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Diltiazem (钙通道阻滞剂)**: Reduces heart rate and blood pressure via calcium channel blockade. Useful in hypertension or coronary vasospasm but not first-line in cocaine-associated ACS (less effective than nitrates for acute ischemia).  
2. **Labetalol (α/β受体阻滞剂)**: Mixed β-blockade risks unopposed α-adrenergic activity in cocaine users, worsening vasospasm/hypertension—**contraindicated**.  
3. **Nitroglycerin (硝酸甘油)**: First-line for angina/ACS; relieves ischemia via coronary vasodilation and preload reduction. Safe in cocaine-associated chest pain if BP is adequate.  
4. **Propranolol (普萘洛尔)**: Non-selective β-blocker—**absolutely contraindicated** in cocaine use (exacerbates vasospasm, hypertension).  
5. **Reassurance/Monitoring (观察)**: Inappropriate for unstable, high-risk presentation.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Nitroglycerin)(硝酸甘油)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Cocaine use necessitates avoiding β-blockers (Options 2, 4).  
  - Nitroglycerin directly addresses coronary vasospasm/ischemia, aligns with ACS management guidelines.  
  - Hypertension and chest pain support its use (if BP is stable).  
  - Diltiazem (Option 1) is secondary if ischemia persists post-nitrates.  
  - Immediate intervention required (Option 5 inappropriate).
