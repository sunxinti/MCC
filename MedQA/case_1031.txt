================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**
- **Patient Information:** A 10-year-old male.
- **Chief Complaint:** Discovery of a painless mass in the left testicle.
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**
  - Elevated Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) level at 350 ng/mL (normal < 10 ng/mL).
  - Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) level is 0.4 IU/L (normal < 0.5 IU/L).
  - Biopsy findings show glomeruli-like structures with a central capillary within a mesodermal core, lined by flattened layers of germ cells.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**
- **Age Factor:** Testicular tumors in children are rare but when they occur, yolk sac tumors are the most common in prepubertal males, whereas seminomas are more prevalent in older males.
- **Tumor Markers:**
  - **AFP Elevation:** Significantly elevated AFP is strongly suggestive of a yolk sac tumor, as this marker is typically produced by these tumors.
  - **hCG Levels:** Normal hCG levels make choriocarcinoma and certain seminomas less likely, as these tumors often show elevated hCG.
- **Biopsy Findings:**
  - The presence of glomeruli-like structures with a central capillary resembles Schiller-Duval bodies, which are pathognomonic for yolk sac tumors.
  - The histological appearance supports the diagnosis of a germ cell tumor consistent with yolk sac tumor features.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**
- **Option 1: Classic Seminoma**
  - **Alignment:** More common in adults; rarely associated with elevated AFP.
  - **Opposition:** The patient's age and elevated AFP levels make this less likely.
- **Option 2: Choriocarcinoma**
  - **Alignment:** Typically presents with elevated hCG.
  - **Opposition:** The patient's hCG is within normal limits, making this diagnosis unlikely.
- **Option 3: Teratoma**
  - **Alignment:** Can occur in children; however, AFP is not typically elevated unless there is a yolk sac component.
  - **Opposition:** The specific biopsy features are not characteristic of teratoma.
- **Option 4: Embryonal Carcinoma**
  - **Alignment:** May present with elevated AFP and hCG.
  - **Opposition:** More common in older individuals and the histological features do not match.
- **Option 5: Yolk Sac Tumor**
  - **Alignment:** Most common testicular tumor in prepubertal males, strongly associated with elevated AFP.
  - **Support:** Biopsy shows Schiller-Duval-like bodies, which are characteristic of yolk sac tumors.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 5 (Yolk sac tumor)(畸胎瘤)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 5 (Yolk sac tumor)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 10-year-old boy presents with a **painless left testicular mass**.  
- Key clinical findings include elevated **AFP (350 ng/mL)**, normal **hCG (0.4 IU/L)**, and a biopsy showing **glomeruli-like structures (Schiller-Duval bodies) with a central capillary within a mesodermal core, lined by flattened germ cells**.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Age**: Testicular tumors in children are rare, but yolk sac tumors (endodermal sinus tumors) are the most common malignant testicular tumors in prepubertal boys. This aligns with the patient’s age.  
- **AFP elevation**: Yolk sac tumors are the **only germ cell tumor consistently associated with marked AFP elevation**. The extremely high AFP (350 ng/mL) strongly supports this diagnosis.  
- **hCG**: The normal hCG level argues against choriocarcinoma, seminoma, or mixed germ cell tumors with choriocarcinoma components.  
- **Biopsy findings**: The **glomeruli-like structures (Schiller-Duval bodies)** are **pathognomonic for yolk sac tumors**. These structures consist of a central capillary surrounded by a mesenchymal core and germ cells.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Classic seminoma**:  
   - Typically presents in adolescents and young adults, not prepubertal boys.  
   - hCG may be elevated in some cases, but AFP is **not elevated**.  
   - Biopsy shows uniform sheets of tumor cells without Schiller-Duval bodies → **unlikely**.  

2. **Choriocarcinoma**:  
   - Characterized by markedly elevated hCG and AFP may be elevated in some cases.  
   - However, the biopsy would show syncytiotrophoblasts and cytotrophoblasts, not Schiller-Duval bodies → **excluded**.  

3. **Teratoma**:  
   - Can be benign or malignant.  
   - AFP is typically **not elevated** unless there is yolk sac differentiation.  
   - Biopsy shows tissues derived from all three germ layers → **does not match the description**.  

4. **Embryonal carcinoma**:  
   - AFP may be elevated in some cases but not as consistently as in yolk sac tumors.  
   - Histology shows undifferentiated sheets of tumor cells without Schiller-Duval bodies → **unlikely**.  

5. **Yolk sac tumor**:  
   - The **only diagnosis** that fully aligns with the patient’s age, elevated AFP, normal hCG, and biopsy findings (Schiller-Duval bodies).  
   - This is the most common testicular tumor in prepubertal males and the hallmark histological feature is present.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 5 (Yolk sac tumor)(卵黄囊瘤)**

Choice: Option 5 (Yolk sac tumor)

DeepSeek's full response:

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 10-year-old boy.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Painless left testicular mass.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations**:  
  - Elevated AFP (350 ng/mL; normal <10 ng/mL).  
  - Normal hCG (0.4 IU/L; normal <0.5 IU/L).  
  - Biopsy findings: Glomeruli-like structures (Schiller-Duval bodies) with a central capillary in a mesodermal core, lined by flattened germ cells.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Elevated AFP**: Strongly associated with yolk sac tumors, which are the most common testicular germ cell tumors in children. AFP is rarely elevated in seminoma, choriocarcinoma, or teratoma.  
- **Normal hCG**: Excludes choriocarcinoma (which causes extreme hCG elevation) and seminoma (may have mild hCG elevation).  
- **Biopsy Findings**: Glomeruli-like structures (Schiller-Duval bodies) are pathognomonic for yolk sac tumors. Teratomas show differentiated tissues (e.g., cartilage, glands), embryonal carcinoma lacks organized structures, and seminoma/choriocarcinoma have distinct histologic patterns.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Classic Seminoma**: Excluded due to elevated AFP (seminomas have normal AFP) and absence of typical uniform large cells with lymphocytic infiltrate.  
2. **Choriocarcinoma**: Excluded due to normal hCG and lack of syncytiotrophoblasts/cytotrophoblasts on biopsy.  
3. **Teratoma**: Excluded as teratomas show mature/immature tissues (e.g., cartilage, epithelium) without Schiller-Duval bodies.  
4. **Embryonal Carcinoma**: Excluded due to lack of primitive epithelial cells with necrosis/mitotic activity; AFP elevation is less specific.  
5. **Yolk Sac Tumor**: Matches all features: elevated AFP, Schiller-Duval bodies on biopsy, and typical presentation in children.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 5 (Yolk sac tumor)(卵黃囊瘤)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Markedly elevated AFP, a hallmark of yolk sac tumors.  
  - Biopsy-confirmed Schiller-Duval bodies (glomeruli-like structures).  
  - Age-appropriate presentation (most common testicular tumor in prepubertal males).
