Case_description: 
A 21-year-old woman comes to the physician for evaluation of excess hair growth on her face. Menses occur irregularly at 45 to 65-day intervals. She is 159 cm (5 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 59 kg (130 lb); BMI is 23 kg/m2. Physical examination shows facial acne and growth of coarse dark hair on the face, chest, and lower back. Pelvic examination shows no abnormalities. Serum studies show:
Sodium 141 mEq/L
Potassium 4.2 mEq/L
Glucose 109 mg/dL
Cortisol (1600 h) 4 μg/dL
Prolactin 14 ng/mL
17-hydroxyprogesterone 390 ng/dL (N=20–300 ng/dL)
Testosterone 91 ng/dL (N=8–60 ng/dL)

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Basic Information**: A 21-year-old woman with a height of 159 cm, weight of 59 kg, and a BMI of 23 kg/m².  
- **Chief Complaint**: Excess hair growth on her face.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations**:  
  - **Reproductive**: Irregular menses occurring at 45 to 65-day intervals.
  - **Dermatological**: Facial acne and growth of coarse dark hair on the face, chest, and lower back.
  - **Laboratory Findings**:  
    - Elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone (390 ng/dL; normal range: 20–300 ng/dL).
    - Elevated testosterone (91 ng/dL; normal range: 8–60 ng/dL).
    - Low cortisol level at 1600 hours (4 μg/dL).
    - Normal prolactin levels (14 ng/mL).
    - Normal electrolytes and glucose levels.
  - **Other**: Negative urine pregnancy test and no abnormalities on pelvic examination.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
The patient presents with signs of hyperandrogenism, including hirsutism and acne, coupled with oligomenorrhea. The elevated testosterone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels suggest an androgen-secreting condition. The low cortisol level, especially in the morning when it should be at its peak, indicates an impairment in cortisol synthesis. The absence of electrolyte abnormalities (normal sodium and potassium) suggests a non-salt-wasting form. These features collectively point towards a possible form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), specifically the non-classic (late-onset) type, likely due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Hyperproliferation of theca interna cells**  
  Typically associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). While PCOS presents with hyperandrogenism and irregular menses, it usually does not involve elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone or cortisol abnormalities.

- **Option 2: Exogenous anabolic steroid use**  
  Can cause hyperandrogenism symptoms; however, it does not explain the elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone and low cortisol levels.

- **Option 3: Compression of the infundibular stalk**  
  This would likely result in hyperprolactinemia, which is not present in this patient.

- **Option 4: Ovarian fibrosis and multiple cystic follicles**  
  Another description related to PCOS. Similar to Option 1, it does not account for the specific hormonal abnormalities seen.

- **Option 5: Hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex**  
  Fits the clinical picture of non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. This condition leads to excess androgen production (elevated testosterone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone) and impaired cortisol synthesis (low cortisol levels). The absence of electrolyte disturbances aligns with the non-salt-wasting variant.

**My final selection is: Option 5 (Hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex)(肾上腺皮质增生)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 5 (Hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 21-year-old woman presents with hirsutism (coarse dark hair on face, chest, and lower back), irregular menses (45–65-day cycles), and facial acne.  
- Key lab findings: elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone (390 ng/dL; upper limit 300 ng/dL) and testosterone (91 ng/dL; upper limit 60 ng/dL).  
- Normal cortisol (4 μg/dL at 1600 h), prolactin (14 ng/mL), and no pelvic abnormalities.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Hyperandrogenism**: Hirsutism, acne, and elevated testosterone strongly suggest hyperandrogenism.  
- **Menstrual irregularity**: Anovulatory cycles due to androgen excess or ovarian/adrenal dysfunction.  
- **Elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone**: This is a critical marker. In congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), impaired cortisol synthesis leads to increased adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), driving overproduction of adrenal androgens (e.g., testosterone) and metabolites like 17-hydroxyprogesterone.  
- **Normal cortisol**: Suggests non-classical CAH (milder form) rather than classical CAH, which would cause cortisol deficiency and electrolyte imbalances.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (Hyperproliferation of theca interna cells)**: Seen in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). While PCOS explains hyperandrogenism and menstrual irregularity, it typically does not elevate 17-hydroxyprogesterone. This lab result aligns more with adrenal, not ovarian, androgen overproduction.  
- **Option 2 (Exogenous anabolic steroid use)**: Would cause elevated testosterone but not elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone. History of steroid use is unmentioned and unlikely given the clinical context.  
- **Option 3 (Compression of the infundibular stalk)**: Causes hyperprolactinemia (elevated prolactin), which is not present here.  
- **Option 4 (Ovarian fibrosis and multiple cystic follicles)**: Classic PCOS features, but again, 17-hydroxyprogesterone elevation is not expected.  
- **Option 5 (Hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex)**: Non-classical CAH (21-hydroxylase deficiency) is the most consistent diagnosis. Elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone and testosterone with normal cortisol fit this condition, which causes adrenal androgen overproduction without severe cortisol deficiency.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 5 (Hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex)(肾上腺皮质增生)**

Choice: Option 5 (Hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex)

DeepSeek's full response:

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 21-year-old woman with hirsutism, irregular menses (45–65-day cycles), acne, and elevated testosterone (91 ng/dL) and 17-hydroxyprogesterone (390 ng/dL).  
- **Key Findings**: Hyperandrogenism (hirsutism, acne, elevated testosterone), menstrual irregularity, and elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone. Normal cortisol (4 μg/dL at 1600h), prolactin, and BMI (23 kg/m²).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Hyperandrogenism**: Elevated testosterone (ovarian or adrenal origin) and hirsutism suggest androgen excess.  
- **Menstrual Irregularity**: Consistent with anovulation, common in PCOS or adrenal disorders.  
- **Elevated 17-Hydroxyprogesterone**: Mildly elevated (390 ng/dL vs. normal ≤300 ng/dL), suggestive of 21-hydroxylase deficiency (nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia, CAH). Cortisol is normal, ruling out classic CAH.  
- **Normal Prolactin/Pregnancy Test**: Excludes hyperprolactinemia or pregnancy-related causes.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Hyperproliferation of theca interna cells (卵巢内膜细胞过度增殖)**:  
   - Aligns with PCOS (ovarian androgen excess). However, PCOS typically shows normal 17-hydroxyprogesterone unless adrenal involvement coexists.  
2. **Exogenous anabolic steroid use (外源性合成代谢类固醇使用)**:  
   - Unlikely; no history of steroid use, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone elevation is unexplained.  
3. **Compression of the infundibular stalk (漏斗柄压迫)**:  
   - Irrelevant; normal prolactin excludes hypothalamic-pituitary disruption.  
4. **Ovarian fibrosis and multiple cystic follicles (卵巢纤维化和多囊卵泡)**:  
   - Inconsistent; PCOS involves cystic follicles but not fibrosis.  
5. **Hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex (肾上腺皮质增生)**:  
   - Best explains elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone (adrenal steroidogenesis defect). Nonclassic CAH mimics PCOS but requires adrenal hyperplasia to compensate for cortisol deficiency.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 5 (Hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex)(肾上腺皮质增生)**  
- **Key Evidence**: Elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone (≥390 ng/dL) strongly suggests 21-hydroxylase deficiency, a hallmark of nonclassic CAH. Adrenal hyperplasia compensates for impaired cortisol synthesis, driving androgen overproduction. While PCOS is common, the 17-hydroxyprogesterone elevation and normal BMI favor adrenal pathology over ovarian theca cell hyperplasia.
