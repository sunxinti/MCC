**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** 7-year-old girl  
- **Chief Complaint:** 10-day history of fever and sore throat, acutely worsened over the past 2 days  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - Sore throat worse on the right side  
  - Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)  
  - Trismus (difficulty opening mouth due to pain)  
  - Change in voice quality over the last day  
  - Fever of 38.2°C (100.8°F)  
  - Cervical lymphadenopathy  
  - Oropharyngeal examination: erythematous tonsils, swelling of the right tonsillar pillar, uvula deviated to the left  
  - Laboratory findings: leukocytosis (12,000/mm³)  
- **Decisive Signs:**  
  - Unilateral tonsillar swelling with uvular deviation  
  - Acute worsening with trismus  
  - Presence of cervical lymphadenopathy and leukocytosis

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline:** The patient has had a prolonged febrile and sore throat illness for 10 days, with a sudden exacerbation over the last 2 days. This progression suggests a complication of an initial pharyngeal infection.  
- **Unilateral Symptoms:** The sore throat being worse on the right side, along with unilateral swelling of the tonsillar pillar and uvular deviation, strongly indicate a localized peritonsillar complication, such as a peritonsillar abscess.  
- **Trismus and Voice Changes:** These symptoms are consistent with a peritonsillar abscess, where inflammation and swelling restrict jaw movement and affect the vocal cords' function.  
- **Laboratory Results:** An elevated leukocyte count supports an acute bacterial infection.  
- **Differential Considerations:**  
  - **Peritonsillar Abscess (Quinsy):** Supported by unilateral tonsillar swelling, uvular deviation, trismus, and acute worsening.  
  - **Tonsillitis:** Usually bilateral and less likely to cause significant trismus and uvular deviation.  
  - **Retropharyngeal Abscess:** Possible but less likely given the specific tonsillar findings.  
  - **Epiglottitis:** Typically presents with more acute and severe respiratory distress, which is not evident here.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Intravenous dexamethasone therapy**  
  - **Analysis:** Dexamethasone may reduce inflammation but does not address the likely abscess, which requires drainage.  
  - **Suitability:** Inadequate as monotherapy for abscess management.  
- **Option 2: Tonsillectomy**  
  - **Analysis:** Tonsillectomy might be considered in recurrent cases but is not the immediate management for an acute abscess.  
  - **Suitability:** Not appropriate in the acute setting.  
- **Option 3: Incision and drainage with intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam therapy**  
  - **Analysis:** This combines surgical drainage of the abscess with broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, which is the standard of care for a peritonsillar abscess.  
  - **Suitability:** Highly appropriate given the clinical presentation.  
- **Option 4: Needle aspiration and oral clindamycin therapy**  
  - **Analysis:** Needle aspiration is a valid drainage method; however, oral antibiotics may be insufficient for a severe or complicated abscess.  
  - **Suitability:** Less optimal compared to intravenous antibiotic administration.  
- **Option 5: Intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam therapy**  
  - **Analysis:** While appropriate for antibiotic coverage, it lacks the necessary drainage component for an abscess.  
  - **Suitability:** Incomplete treatment for a peritonsillar abscess.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Incision and drainage with intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam therapy)（切开引流并静脉注射阿莫西林-舒巴坦治疗）**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 3 (Incision and drainage with intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam therapy)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 7-year-old girl presents with a 10-day history of fever and sore throat, worsening over 2 days with right-sided predominance.  
- Key symptoms include severe throat pain, difficulty swallowing (odynophagia), trismus (difficulty opening the mouth), and voice change.  
- **Decisive clinical signs**:  
  - **Uvula deviation to the left**, indicating significant right-sided peritonsillar swelling.  
  - **Right tonsillar pillar swelling**, erythematous tonsils, and cervical lymphadenopathy.  
  - Elevated leukocyte count (12,000/mm³) supports an infectious process.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline**: The 10-day history of fever and sore throat suggests a chronic or progressing infection, possibly complicating an initial streptococcal pharyngitis. The acute worsening over 2 days aligns with abscess formation.  
- **Unilateral symptoms (right-sided)**: Trismus, uvula deviation, and localized swelling strongly suggest a **peritonsillar abscess**. These findings are classic for a localized collection of pus, which exerts pressure posteriorly, displacing the uvula.  
- **Voice change**: Reflects involvement of the surrounding structures (e.g., vocal cord dysfunction due to inflammation or abscess spread).  
- **Lab findings**: Leukocytosis supports bacterial infection. Normal hemoglobin and platelets make hemorrhage or clotting disorders unlikely. Elevated creatinine (1.1 mg/dL) may be age-related or due to dehydration but is not critical in this context.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Intravenous dexamethasone therapy**  
  - Dexamethasone may reduce inflammation but is not definitive treatment for an abscess. Used adjunctively in severe cases, but drainage remains essential.  
  - **Unlikely**: Does not address pus collection.  

- **Option 2: Tonsillectomy**  
  - Reserved for recurrent tonsillitis or severe obstruction unresponsive to medical therapy. Not indicated acutely for abscess unless definitive surgery is planned post-drainage.  
  - **Unlikely**: Inappropriate for acute abscess.  

- **Option 3: Incision and drainage with IV ampicillin-sulbactam**  
  - **Peritonsillar abscess** requires **incision and drainage (I&D)** to relieve pressure and drain pus. Combined with IV antibiotics (e.g., ampicillin-sulbactam for coverage of *Streptococcus pyogenes* and anaerobes) is standard.  
  - **Most appropriate**: Addresses both pus evacuation and infection source.  

- **Option 4: Needle aspiration and oral clindamycin**  
  - Needle aspiration is an alternative to I&D but may be less effective for larger abscesses. Oral clindamycin is appropriate, but IV antibiotics may be preferred in severe cases.  
  - **Less optimal**: Risk of incomplete drainage; trismus complicates aspiration.  

- **Option 5: IV ampicillin-sulbactam alone**  
  - Antibiotics alone may fail to drain pus, leading to persistent inflammation or complications (e.g., parapharyngeal space infection).  
  - **Insufficient**: Drainage is critical for abscess resolution.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Incision and drainage with intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam therapy)(切开引流及静脉氨苄西林舒巴坦治疗)**  

**Key evidence supporting this choice**:  
- **Uvula deviation and unilateral tonsillar swelling** are hallmark signs of peritonsillar abscess requiring drainage.  
- **Incision and drainage** is the definitive treatment to reduce pressure and prevent airway compromise.  
- **Ampicillin-sulbactam** covers common pathogens (streptococci, anaerobes) and is appropriate for severe infections.  
- Antibiotics alone (Option 5) or aspiration (Option 4) are less effective for large abscesses in this clinical context.

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 3 (Incision and drainage with intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam therapy)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 7-year-old girl with 10-day fever and sore throat, acutely worsening over 2 days.  
- **Key Symptoms**:  
  - Unilateral (right) severe sore throat with dysphagia and trismus.  
  - Recent voice change (likely muffled/"hot potato" voice).  
  - **Exam Findings**:  
    - Cervical lymphadenopathy.  
    - Right tonsillar pillar swelling, erythematous tonsils, and **uvular deviation to the left**.  
    - Mild leukocytosis (12,000/mm³).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline**: Subacute progression (10 days) with acute deterioration (2 days) suggests a complication of untreated pharyngotonsillitis (e.g., abscess formation).  
- **Critical Signs**:  
  - **Uvular deviation**: Pathognomonic for a space-occupying lesion (e.g., peritonsillar abscess).  
  - **Trismus and dysphagia**: Indicates inflammation involving the pterygoid muscles and pharyngeal constrictors.  
  - **Unilateral swelling**: Localizes the infection to the right peritonsillar space.  
- **Contraindications**:  
  - No respiratory distress or stridor (argues against epiglottitis or retropharyngeal abscess).  
  - Normal platelet count and stable vital signs (no overt sepsis).  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Intravenous dexamethasone (Option 1)**: Adjunct for reducing inflammation but insufficient as monotherapy for abscess.  
2. **Tonsillectomy (Option 2)**: Reserved for recurrent abscesses or chronic tonsillitis, not acute management.  
3. **Incision and drainage + IV ampicillin-sulbactam (Option 3)**:  
   - **Alignment**: Gold standard for peritonsillar abscess. Drainage is mandatory to resolve the abscess, and IV antibiotics (e.g., ampicillin-sulbactam) cover streptococci and oral anaerobes.  
4. **Needle aspiration + oral clindamycin (Option 4)**:  
   - Aspiration is less invasive but may fail in severe trismus. Oral clindamycin is suboptimal in acute, systemic infection (poor bioavailability, compliance risks).  
5. **IV ampicillin-sulbactam alone (Option 5)**: Abscesses require source control (drainage); antibiotics alone are inadequate.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Incision and drainage with intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam therapy)(切开引流联合静脉注射氨苄西林-舒巴坦治疗)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Uvular deviation and trismus confirm peritonsillar abscess.  
  - Drainage (incision or aspiration) is mandatory; IV ampicillin-sulbactam provides broad coverage for polymicrobial infections.  
  - Oral clindamycin (Option 4) and delayed drainage (Option 5) are less effective in severe cases.
