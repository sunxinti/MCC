Case_id: case_292
Case_description: 
A 28-year-old female visits her physician for workup of a new onset diastolic murmur found on physical examination. Past medical history is insignificant. Her temperature is 37.0 degrees C, blood pressure is 115/75 mm Hg, pulse is 76/min, and respiratory rate is 16/min. The patient denies dyspnea, fatigue, and syncope. Transthoracic echocardiography reveals a large, pedunculated tumor in the left atrium. This patient is most at risk for:
Options: 
1. Abrupt hypotension
2. Sudden cardiac death
3. Deep venous thrombosis
4. Acute arterial occlusion
5. Septic embolism
Correct Answer: Acute arterial occlusion

================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** 28-year-old female with no significant past medical history.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Workup of a newly discovered diastolic murmur during a routine physical examination.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - Vital signs: Temperature 37.0°C, Blood pressure 115/75 mm Hg, Pulse 76/min, Respiratory rate 16/min.  
  - Absence of symptoms such as dyspnea, fatigue, and syncope.  
  - Transthoracic echocardiography findings: Large, pedunculated tumor in the left atrium.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Diastolic Murmur:** Suggestive of mitral or aortic valve pathology. In the context of a left atrial tumor, it may result from obstruction of mitral valve inflow or turbulent blood flow caused by the mass.  
- **Asymptomatic Presentation:** The lack of symptoms like dyspnea or syncope indicates that the tumor might intermittently obstruct cardiac function without causing significant hemodynamic compromise at rest.  
- **Echocardiography Findings:** A large, pedunculated left atrial tumor is highly suggestive of a myxoma, the most common primary cardiac tumor. The mobility of a pedunculated mass poses risks for embolization.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Abrupt Hypotension**  
  - *Likelihood:* Possible if the tumor intermittently obstructs ventricular filling, leading to sudden drops in blood pressure.  
  - *Alignment:* The patient currently does not exhibit hypotension or symptoms like syncope, making this less likely as an immediate risk.  

- **Option 2: Sudden Cardiac Death**  
  - *Likelihood:* While cardiac tumors can cause life-threatening complications, sudden cardiac death is a rare presentation without preceding severe symptoms.  
  - *Alignment:* The absence of acute hemodynamic compromise or arrhythmias makes this less likely.  

- **Option 3: Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT)**  
  - *Likelihood:* DVT is typically associated with venous stasis, hypercoagulability, or endothelial injury, unrelated to a left atrial tumor.  
  - *Alignment:* No clinical signs or risk factors for DVT are present, making this option unlikely.  

- **Option 4: Acute Arterial Occlusion**  
  - *Likelihood:* A pedunculated left atrial tumor such as a myxoma can embolize into the systemic circulation, leading to acute arterial occlusions (e.g., stroke, limb ischemia).  
  - *Alignment:* This aligns well with the presence of a left atrial mass and poses a significant and immediate risk.  

- **Option 5: Septic Embolism**  
  - *Likelihood:* Septic emboli are typically associated with infective endocarditis, characterized by signs of infection, which are absent in this patient.  
  - *Alignment:* Lack of fever, leukocytosis, or other infection signs makes this an unlikely risk.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Acute arterial occlusion)(急性动脉阻塞)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 4 (Acute arterial occlusion)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 28-year-old female presents with a newly discovered diastolic murmur on physical examination. She has no significant past medical history, denies symptoms like dyspnea, fatigue, or syncope, and her vital signs are normal.  
- **Key finding**: Transthoracic echocardiography reveals a **large, pedunculated tumor in the left atrium**. This feature is critical, as left atrial masses, particularly myxomas, are associated with specific complications.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Diastolic murmur**: Suggests blood flow impedance during diastole, possibly due to the tumor obstructing the mitral valve or causing turbulence.  
- **Pedunculated tumor**: A stalk-like attachment increases mobility, raising the risk of **embolization** (fragments breaking off and entering systemic circulation).  
- **Asymptomatic presentation**: The patient lacks typical symptoms of heart failure or embolic events, but the tumor’s location and mobility remain the primary risk factors.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (Abrupt hypotension)**: Unlikely unless the tumor acutely obstructs mitral inflow. However, the patient’s stable vital signs and lack of acute symptoms make this less probable.  
- **Option 2 (Sudden cardiac death)**: Requires arrhythmia or conduction block. While possible, this is less common than embolic complications in left atrial tumors like myxomas.  
- **Option 3 (Deep venous thrombosis)**: Unrelated to left atrial pathology. Venous thrombosis would not arise from a left-sided cardiac mass.  
- **Option 4 (Acute arterial occlusion)**: **Most likely**. Left atrial masses (e.g., myxomas) commonly embolize to systemic arteries (e.g., brain, kidneys, limbs). The pedunculated nature and mobility of the tumor increase this risk.  
- **Option 5 (Septic embolism)**: Requires infection (e.g., endocarditis). No fever or signs of infection are present, making this unlikely.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Acute arterial occlusion)(急性动脉阻塞)**  

**Key evidence**:  
- Left atrial tumors, particularly myxomas, are the most common primary cardiac tumors in adults and are strongly associated with **systemic embolization** due to their mobility and friable texture.  
- A **pedunculated tumor** is more prone to fragment and embolize, leading to acute arterial occlusion in peripheral or visceral arteries.  
- The absence of symptoms like syncope or chest pain does not exclude embolic risk, as embolic events can occur suddenly and unpredictably.

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 4 (Acute arterial occlusion)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Profile**: 28-year-old female with no significant past medical history.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Incidental finding of a new diastolic murmur on physical exam.  
- **Key Findings**: Asymptomatic (denies dyspnea, fatigue, syncope). Transthoracic echocardiography reveals a **large, pedunculated left atrial tumor**.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Pedunculated Left Atrial Tumor**: Highly suggestive of a **cardiac myxoma** (most common primary cardiac tumor).  
- **Diastolic Murmur**: Likely due to intermittent obstruction of the mitral valve by the tumor.  
- **Absence of Symptoms**: Despite the tumor size, the patient is asymptomatic, indicating no current hemodynamic compromise.  
- **Key Risk**: The **mobile, pedunculated nature** of the tumor increases the risk of **embolization** or **acute obstruction**.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Abrupt Hypotension (Option 1)**: Possible if the tumor transiently obstructs the mitral valve, but the patient is currently asymptomatic. Less likely as the primary risk.  
2. **Sudden Cardiac Death (Option 2)**: A known complication of atrial myxomas due to acute mitral valve obstruction or coronary embolism. However, this is rare in asymptomatic patients.  
3. **Deep Venous Thrombosis (Option 3)**: Unrelated to a left atrial tumor, which does not affect venous stasis.  
4. **Acute Arterial Occlusion (Option 4)**: High risk due to **systemic embolization** of tumor fragments or thrombi from the left atrial mass. This aligns with the tumor’s location (left atrium) and pedunculated morphology.  
5. **Septic Embolism (Option 5)**: Requires an infected tumor (e.g., endocarditis), which is not described here.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Acute arterial occlusion)(急性动脉闭塞)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Left atrial tumors (e.g., myxomas) are prone to embolize into the systemic circulation due to their mobility.  
  - Acute arterial occlusion (e.g., stroke, limb ischemia) is a **well-documented complication**, occurring in 30–40% of cases.  
  - Sudden cardiac death (Option 2) is less common in asymptomatic patients compared to embolic events.
