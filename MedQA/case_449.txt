Case_description: 
A 38-year-old woman undergoes a partial thyroidectomy for an enlarged thyroid gland compressing the trachea. During surgery, a young surgeon ligates the inferior thyroid arteries as close to the poles as possible to prevent intraoperative hemorrhage. 2 weeks later, the patient presents to the outpatient clinic with hoarseness. What could be the most likely cause of her hoarseness?
Options: 
1. Internal laryngeal nerve injury
2. Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury
3. Phrenic nerve damage
4. External laryngeal nerve injury
5. Laryngeal edema
Correct Answer: Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury

GPT's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** A 38-year-old woman.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Hoarseness.  
- **Clinical Context:** She underwent a partial thyroidectomy due to an enlarged thyroid gland compressing the trachea. During the surgery, the inferior thyroid arteries were ligated near the poles to prevent intraoperative hemorrhage.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestation:** Development of hoarseness two weeks post-surgery.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline:** The onset of hoarseness occurred two weeks after thyroid surgery, indicating a delayed postoperative complication.  
- **Nature of Symptom:** Hoarseness suggests involvement of the vocal apparatus, potentially implicating the nerves responsible for vocal cord function.  
- **Surgical Details:** Ligating the inferior thyroid arteries near the thyroid poles increases the risk of nerve injury, particularly the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN), which runs in close proximity to these vessels.  
- **Interrelationship:** Nerve injuries during thyroid surgery can lead to vocal cord paralysis or dysfunction, manifesting as hoarseness. The absence of immediate postoperative distress and the delayed onset are consistent with nerve healing or swelling implications rather than acute hemorrhage or embolic events.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Internal Laryngeal Nerve Injury:**  
   - **Role:** Provides sensory innervation above the vocal cords.  
   - **Symptoms:** More associated with impaired sensation and potential aspiration, not primarily hoarseness.  
   - **Likelihood:** Low.  
2. **Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve Injury:**  
   - **Role:** Controls the majority of intrinsic muscles of the larynx responsible for vocal cord movement.  
   - **Symptoms:** Hoarseness, vocal cord paralysis or paresis.  
   - **Likelihood:** High. RLN is at significant risk during thyroidectomy, especially near the inferior thyroid arteries.  
3. **Phrenic Nerve Damage:**  
   - **Role:** Innervates the diaphragm, affecting respiratory movement.  
   - **Symptoms:** Dyspnea, especially on the affected side, not isolated hoarseness.  
   - **Likelihood:** Low.  
4. **External Laryngeal Nerve Injury:**  
   - **Role:** Innervates the cricothyroid muscle, affecting pitch modulation.  
   - **Symptoms:** Altered pitch control rather than hoarseness.  
   - **Likelihood:** Moderate to Low.  
5. **Laryngeal Edema:**  
   - **Role:** Swelling in the laryngeal structures can cause hoarseness.  
   - **Symptoms:** Hoarseness, possible breathing difficulties if severe.  
   - **Likelihood:** Possible, but less likely given the surgical context focusing on nerve proximity.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury) (选项2：复发喉神经损伤)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 2 (Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 38-year-old woman who underwent a partial thyroidectomy for thyroid enlargement causing tracheal compression.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Hoarseness presenting 2 weeks post-surgery.  
- **Key Symptoms**: Persistent hoarseness after thyroid surgery, which is a classic sign of vocal cord dysfunction.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline**: Hoarseness occurs 2 weeks post-surgery, which is beyond the acute phase of surgical trauma or edema. This suggests a structural injury rather than transient inflammation.  
- **Mechanism**: During thyroidectomy, the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) is at high risk of injury due to its anatomical proximity to the thyroid gland and inferior thyroid artery. Ligation of the inferior thyroid artery **close to the gland** increases the likelihood of RLN injury, as the nerve typically loops around the artery near its origin.  
- **Symptom Specificity**: Hoarseness arises from vocal cord paralysis or paresis, which is almost exclusively caused by RLN injury. Other nerve injuries (e.g., external laryngeal nerve) do not directly impair vocal cord movement.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (Internal laryngeal nerve injury)**: This nerve governs sensation in the larynx and supraglottic region. Injury would cause dysphagia or coughing with swallowing, not hoarseness. **Unlikely**.  
- **Option 2 (Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury)**: The RLN innervates all intrinsic laryngeal muscles except the cricothyroid. Injury causes vocal cord paralysis, leading to hoarseness. The surgical technique (ligating inferior thyroid arteries near the gland) directly risks RLN injury. **Highly likely**.  
- **Option 3 (Phrenic nerve damage)**: The phrenic nerve controls diaphragmatic movement. Injury would manifest as dyspnea, not hoarseness. **Irrelevant**.  
- **Option 4 (External laryngeal nerve injury)**: This nerve controls the cricothyroid muscle, which tenses the vocal cord. Injury causes weakness in pitch modulation (e.g., voice fatigue), not hoarseness. **Less likely**.  
- **Option 5 (Laryngeal edema)**: Acute postoperative edema resolves within days. Persistent hoarseness at 2 weeks points to a structural cause. **Unlikely**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury)(喉返神经损伤)**

DeepSeek is reasoning the answer...

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 2 (Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 38-year-old woman post-partial thyroidectomy for tracheal compression.  
- **Key Symptoms**: Hoarseness developing 2 weeks after surgery.  
- **Decisive Features**: Temporal association with thyroidectomy involving ligation of inferior thyroid arteries; absence of acute respiratory distress or immediate postoperative hoarseness.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline**: Hoarseness manifests 2 weeks post-surgery, ruling out immediate postoperative complications like acute laryngeal edema (typically resolves within days).  
- **Surgical Context**: Ligation of inferior thyroid arteries near the poles increases proximity to the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN), a critical structure vulnerable to iatrogenic injury.  
- **Symptom Specificity**: Hoarseness strongly correlates with vocal cord dysfunction, implicating motor nerve injury rather than sensory (e.g., internal laryngeal nerve) or non-neural causes (e.g., edema).  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Internal laryngeal nerve injury**: Unlikely. This nerve is sensory to the supraglottic larynx; injury would cause aspiration or cough, not isolated hoarseness.  
2. **Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury**: **Most likely**. The RLN courses near the inferior thyroid artery and is at high risk during ligation. Unilateral injury causes vocal cord paralysis (hoarseness).  
3. **Phrenic nerve damage**: Irrelevant. The phrenic nerve innervates the diaphragm; injury would cause respiratory issues, not hoarseness.  
4. **External laryngeal nerve injury**: Less likely. This nerve lies near the superior thyroid artery (not ligated here) and affects vocal pitch, not hoarseness.  
5. **Laryngeal edema**: Unlikely. Edema typically resolves within days post-surgery; delayed hoarseness suggests structural nerve injury.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury)(喉返神经损伤)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Anatomical proximity of the RLN to the inferior thyroid artery, making it susceptible to injury during ligation.  
  - Hoarseness aligns with vocal cord paralysis, a hallmark of RLN injury.  
  - Delayed presentation (2 weeks) excludes transient edema and supports nerve damage.
