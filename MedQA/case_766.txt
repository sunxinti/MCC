**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** 16-year-old healthy female with no significant past medical history, actively engaged in volleyball, normal BMI (22 kg/m²), and excellent academic performance.
- **Chief Complaint:** Primary amenorrhea (absence of menstrual periods).
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:** 
  - Normal female external genitalia.
  - Presence of pubic hair in typical female distribution.
  - Normal breast development.
  - Transabdominal ultrasound reveals an absent uterus.
  - Normal serum testosterone levels for females.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Primary Amenorrhea:** The absence of menstruation by age 16 warrants evaluation for anatomical or hormonal causes.
- **Normal Secondary Sexual Characteristics:** Presence of normal breast development and pubic hair suggests normal estrogen levels and adrenal androgen production.
- **Absent Uterus on Ultrasound:** Indicates a possible congenital malformation of the Müllerian ducts.
- **Normal Testosterone Levels:** Rules out androgen excess conditions and supports normal ovarian function.
- **Normal External Genitalia:** Suggests that androgen receptors are functioning appropriately, as androgen insensitivity could lead to ambiguous or male genitalia.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Pituitary Tumor:** 
   - **Likelihood:** Low. Pituitary tumors can cause hypogonadotropic hypogonadism leading to amenorrhea, but typically present with additional symptoms like headaches or visual disturbances. Also, secondary sexual characteristics are usually underdeveloped, which is not the case here.
   
2. **Absence of Second X Chromosome (Turner Syndrome):** 
   - **Likelihood:** Low. Turner syndrome (45,X) is associated with short stature, webbed neck, and streak gonads. The patient does not exhibit these features and has normal breast development without hormone replacement therapy.
   
3. **Mutation in Enzyme that Metabolizes Testosterone:** 
   - **Likelihood:** Low. Enzyme mutations like 5-alpha reductase deficiency typically present with ambiguous genitalia or undervirilization in genetic males, which does not align with this patient's normal female external genitalia and puberty progression.
   
4. **Androgen Receptor Mutation:** 
   - **Likelihood:** Low. Androgen receptor mutations, as seen in Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (CAIS), present with female external genitalia and absent internal female reproductive organs. However, CAIS patients usually have sparse or absent pubic hair due to androgen insensitivity, which contradicts the presence of normal pubic hair in this patient.
   
5. **Failure of Paramesonephric Duct Development (Müllerian Agenesis):** 
   - **Likelihood:** High. Müllerian agenesis (MRKH syndrome) is characterized by the congenital absence of the uterus and upper two-thirds of the vagina in females with a normal 46,XX karyotype. Patients typically have normal ovarian function and secondary sexual characteristics, including normal breast and pubic hair development, aligning perfectly with this patient's presentation.

**My final selection is: Option 5 (Failure of paramesonephric duct development) (输导管发育不全)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 5 (Failure of paramesonephric duct development)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 16-year-old healthy female presents with primary amenorrhea (absence of menstruation). She has no past medical history, normal BMI (22 kg/m²), and normal physical examination findings of external genitalia, pubic hair, and breast development.  
- **Decisive findings**: Absent uterus on ultrasound, normal testosterone levels, and normal secondary sexual characteristics (breasts and pubic hair).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Primary amenorrhea** in a patient with normal secondary sexual characteristics (breasts, pubic hair) suggests a defect in Müllerian duct (paramesonephric duct) development rather than a hypothalamic/pituitary disorder or androgen insensitivity.  
- **Normal testosterone levels** rule out disorders of androgen synthesis or metabolism (e.g., 5α-reductase deficiency or androgen receptor mutations), as these would disrupt secondary sexual development or cause virilization.  
- **Absent uterus** indicates failure of Müllerian duct fusion, a key feature of Müllerian aplasia (e.g., Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser [MRKH] syndrome).  
- The absence of other systemic abnormalities (e.g., short stature, webbed neck) makes conditions like Turner syndrome (45,XO) less likely, though karyotype testing would confirm this.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Pituitary tumor**  
  - Unlikely. Pituitary tumors (e.g., prolactinoma) typically disrupt gonadotropin secretion, leading to hypogonadism and delayed puberty. However, this patient has normal secondary sexual characteristics, indicating intact estrogen production. No symptoms of mass effect (headache, visual field defects) are noted.  

- **Option 2: Absence of second X chromosome (Turner syndrome)**  
  - Possible but less likely. Turner syndrome (45,XO) causes primary amenorrhea, short stature, and gonadal dysgenesis. However, this patient has normal breast development and BMI, suggesting functional ovaries. A karyotype would confirm, but the absence of other Turner features (e.g., webbed neck, coarctation of the aorta) reduces its likelihood.  

- **Option 3: Mutation in enzyme metabolizing testosterone**  
  - Unlikely. Disorders like 5α-reductase deficiency or 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency disrupt androgen action, leading to ambiguous genitalia or delayed puberty. The patient’s normal genitalia and secondary sexual traits make this improbable.  

- **Option 4: Androgen receptor mutation (Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome [AIS])**  
  - Unlikely. Complete AIS presents with undervirilized male genitalia, while partial AIS may cause ambiguous genitalia. This patient has normal female external genitalia and secondary sexual characteristics, making AIS inconsistent.  

- **Option 5: Failure of paramesonephric duct development (MRKH syndrome)**  
  - Most likely. MRKH syndrome results from Müllerian duct aplasia, causing absence of the uterus and upper vagina. Affected individuals have normal ovaries, estrogen production, and secondary sexual characteristics. This aligns perfectly with the patient’s normal breast development, normal testosterone levels, and absent uterus.

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 5 (Failure of paramesonephric duct development)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Profile**: 16-year-old healthy female with primary amenorrhea. No medical history, normal BMI (22 kg/m²), active in sports.  
- **Key Findings**:  
  - Absent uterus on transabdominal ultrasound.  
  - Normal female external genitalia, pubic hair distribution, and breast development.  
  - Normal serum testosterone (female range).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Primary Amenorrhea**: Absence of menarche by age 15–16 in a patient with normal secondary sexual characteristics suggests structural or congenital anomalies.  
- **Absent Uterus**: Indicates Müllerian duct anomaly (e.g., agenesis).  
- **Normal Secondary Sexual Characteristics**: Breast development (thelarche) and pubic hair (adrenarche) imply functional ovaries and intact hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis.  
- **Normal Testosterone**: Rules out hyperandrogenism or androgen insensitivity (which would elevate testosterone in XY individuals).  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Pituitary Tumor**: Unlikely. Normal estrogen-dependent breast development and absence of symptoms (e.g., headaches, galactorrhea) oppose this. Pituitary dysfunction would typically cause hypogonadism with a small but present uterus.  
2. **Absence of Second X Chromosome (Turner Syndrome)**: Excluded. Turner syndrome (45,X) causes streak ovaries, low estrogen, and absent breast development, which contrasts with this patient’s normal phenotype.  
3. **Mutation in Testosterone-Metabolizing Enzyme**: Unlikely. Such mutations (e.g., 5α-reductase deficiency) affect XY individuals, causing ambiguous genitalia. Normal female external genitalia and testosterone levels rule this out.  
4. **Androgen Receptor Mutation (Complete AIS)**: Excluded. Complete AIS (46,XY) presents with female external genitalia and absent uterus but is associated with elevated male-range testosterone and undescended testes. Normal female testosterone levels contradict this.  
5. **Failure of Paramesonephric Duct Development (MRKH Syndrome)**: **Strongly Supported**. Müllerian agenesis (MRKH) aligns with absent uterus, normal ovaries, and secondary sexual characteristics. Normal testosterone and karyotype (46,XX) are consistent.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 5 (Failure of paramesonephric duct development)(副中肾管发育不全)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Absent uterus with normal ovaries and secondary sexual characteristics confirms Müllerian agenesis.  
  - Normal testosterone and female karyotype exclude androgen-related disorders and Turner syndrome.  
  - MRKH is the most common cause of primary amenorrhea with Müllerian anomalies.
