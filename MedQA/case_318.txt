GPT's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** A 21-year-old sexually active woman with one male partner.
- **Chief Complaints:** Right arm pain with limited range of motion, diarrhea, nausea, and pain during intercourse (dyspareunia).
- **Clinical Manifestations:**
  - **Musculoskeletal:** Right arm pain without recalled trauma, absence of erythema or edema.
  - **Gastrointestinal:** Diarrhea and nausea, with a negative fecal occult test.
  - **Abdominal Examination:** Vague and diffuse tenderness in all four quadrants.
  - **Psychiatric History:** Seven ER visits in the past year presenting with similar symptoms.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Musculoskeletal Symptoms:** The absence of trauma, erythema, and edema suggests a non-organic cause for the right arm pain. Limited range of motion without objective findings raises suspicion for a psychological component.
- **Gastrointestinal Symptoms:** Diarrhea and nausea without positive fecal occult test indicate functional gastrointestinal issues rather than an inflammatory or infectious process.
- **Sexual Health:** Dyspareunia may be related to psychological factors, especially in the context of multiple unexplained physical symptoms.
- **Recurrent ER Visits:** Seven visits in a year for similar, varied symptoms suggest a pattern inconsistent with a single organic pathology.
- **Interrelationship of Symptoms:** The diversity of symptoms across multiple systems (musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, sexual) without clear organic causes points towards a psychological origin.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**

1. **Ulcerative Colitis:**  
   - **Likelihood:** Low. While gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea are present, the negative fecal occult test and the presence of musculoskeletal and sexual symptoms without evidence of colonic inflammation make this diagnosis unlikely.

2. **Illness Anxiety Disorder:**  
   - **Likelihood:** Moderate. This disorder involves preoccupation with having a serious illness without significant physical symptoms. However, the patient presents with multiple physical complaints, which is more characteristic of another disorder.

3. **Somatization Disorder:**  
   - **Likelihood:** High. Characterized by multiple, recurrent, and changing physical symptoms affecting different bodily systems without an identifiable medical cause. The patient's diverse symptoms and multiple ER visits align well with this diagnosis.

4. **Somatoform Pain Disorder:**  
   - **Likelihood:** Moderate to High. Focused on pain symptoms without an organic cause. While the patient does present with right arm pain, her symptoms span beyond pain to include gastrointestinal and sexual domains, making somatization disorder a more encompassing fit.

5. **Conversion Disorder:**  
   - **Likelihood:** Low. Typically involves neurological symptoms like paralysis, blindness, or seizures without neurological explanation. The patient's symptoms are more varied and not primarily neurological.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Somatization disorder)(躯体化障碍)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 3 (Somatization disorder)

Qwen's full response:

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 21-year-old woman presents with recurrent right arm pain/limited mobility (no trauma), diarrhea, nausea, dyspareunia, and diffuse abdominal tenderness.  
- **Decisive features**:  
  - **Recurrent ER visits (7 times in 1 year)** with similar multisystem symptoms.  
  - **No objective findings**: No erythema/edema in the arm, negative fecal occult blood test, and lack of trauma history.  
  - **Vague, diffuse abdominal tenderness** and **genitourinary symptom (dyspareunia)**.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Symptoms timeline**: Recurrent episodes with similar patterns suggest a chronic, non-organic cause.  
- **Interconnected symptoms**: Musculoskeletal (arm pain), gastrointestinal (diarrhea/nausea), and genitourinary (dyspareunia) involvement without anatomical correlation.  
- **Negative tests**: Absence of trauma, normal fecal occult test, and lack of localizing signs (e.g., erythema) weaken organic diagnoses like trauma, inflammatory bowel disease, or infection.  
- **Psychosocial context**: Young age, sexual activity, and recurrent medically unexplained symptoms raise suspicion for a functional/psychogenic disorder.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **1. Ulcerative colitis**:  
  - **Support**: Diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain.  
  - **Oppose**: Negative fecal occult test (low sensitivity but unlikely in active UC), lack of blood/mucus in stool, and absence of colitis-specific features (e.g., perianal lesions).  
  - **Unlikely**: Symptoms are too multisystem and recurrent without progression.  

- **2. Illness anxiety disorder**:  
  - **Support**: Recurrent healthcare-seeking behavior.  
  - **Oppose**: Requires **no physical symptoms** (patient has clear physical complaints like pain and dyspareunia).  
  - **Unlikely**: Does not account for objective symptoms.  

- **3. Somatization disorder**:  
  - **Support**:  
    - Multiple **recurrent, unexplained symptoms** across organ systems (musculoskeletal, GI, genitourinary).  
    - Chronicity (1 year of ER visits) and significant distress.  
  - **Oppose**: None; aligns perfectly with diagnostic criteria (now termed "somatic symptom disorder" in DSM-5, but the term "somatization" is still acceptable in this context).  

- **4. Somatoform pain disorder**:  
  - **Support**: Chronic pain (arm, abdomen).  
  - **Oppose**: Limited to pain, whereas the patient has **multisystem symptoms**, favoring a broader disorder like somatization.  

- **5. Conversion disorder**:  
  - **Support**: Psychosocial stress (e.g., sexual activity, dyspareunia) linked to neurological-like symptoms.  
  - **Oppose**: Symptoms are **non-neurological** (e.g., diffuse abdominal pain, dyspareunia) and lack the sudden, dramatic onset typical of conversion.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Somatization disorder) (躯体化障碍)**  

**Key evidence**:  
- Recurrent multisystem symptoms (arm pain, GI, dyspareunia) without objective pathology.  
- Chronic, medically unexplained presentations over a year.  
- Alignment with somatization disorder criteria (multiple, diverse symptoms causing significant impairment).  
- Exclusion of organic causes (negative tests, no trauma, no inflammatory markers).

Choice: Option 3 (Somatization disorder)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 21-year-old sexually active woman.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Right arm pain with limited range of motion (no trauma), diarrhea, nausea, and dyspareunia.  
- **Key Findings**:  
  - Vague/diffuse abdominal tenderness in all quadrants.  
  - No erythema/edema in the right arm.  
  - Negative fecal occult blood test.  
  - Recurrent ER visits (7 times/year) with similar symptoms.  

**Decisive Features**:  
- Multiple somatic complaints (pain, GI, sexual) without clear organic explanation.  
- Chronic, recurrent presentation with normal diagnostic findings.  

---

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline/Characteristics**:  
  - Chronic, episodic symptoms across multiple organ systems (musculoskeletal, GI, reproductive).  
  - Pain during intercourse (dyspareunia) and abdominal tenderness suggest pelvic involvement but lack specificity for gynecologic or GI pathology.  
  - Absence of trauma, inflammation (erythema/edema), or occult blood argues against acute injury, infection, or UC.  
- **Interrelationships**:  
  - Symptoms lack a unifying organic cause but align with a **somatization pattern** (physical distress linked to psychological factors).  
  - Recurrent ER visits and negative workups highlight a pattern of medically unexplained symptoms.  

**Supporting/Opposing Features**:  
- **Against Organic Disease (e.g., UC)**: Negative fecal occult blood, absence of weight loss/rectal bleeding.  
- **For Somatic Symptom Disorder**: Polysymptomatic presentation, chronicity, and healthcare-seeking behavior.  

---

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Ulcerative Colitis (UC)**: Unlikely. UC requires GI inflammation (e.g., bloody diarrhea, endoscopic findings), absent here.  
2. **Illness Anxiety Disorder**: Focus is on fear of illness, not physical symptoms. Patient reports tangible symptoms, not preoccupation with disease.  
3. **Somatization Disorder**: Strongly aligns. Meets criteria for multiple, chronic somatic symptoms (pain, GI, sexual) without medical explanation.  
4. **Somatoform Pain Disorder**: Focuses on pain as the primary symptom. Insufficient to explain GI/dyspareunia.  
5. **Conversion Disorder**: Explains arm symptoms (functional neurological deficit) but not multisystem involvement (GI, pelvic).  

---

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Somatization disorder)(躯体症状障碍)**  

**Key Evidence**:  
- Polysymptomatic presentation (pain, GI, sexual dysfunction) across unrelated organ systems.  
- Chronicity (>6 months) and recurrent healthcare utilization (7 ER visits/year).  
- Absence of objective findings (normal fecal occult blood, no inflammation/trauma).  
- Somatization disorder classically manifests with medically unexplained symptoms in multiple categories, consistent with this case.
