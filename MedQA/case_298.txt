Case_description: 
An 18-month-old girl is brought to the pediatrician by her mother for vaginal bleeding. The mother states that she noticed the bleeding today, which appeared as brown discharge with clots in the patient’s diaper. The mother denies frequent nosebleeds or easy bruising. She also denies any known trauma. She does mention that the patient has been limping and complaining of left leg pain since a fall 2 months ago. On physical exam, there are multiple 2-3 cm hyperpigmented patches on the patient’s trunk. There is bilateral enlargement of the breasts but no pubic hair. The vaginal orifice is normal and clear with an intact hymen. A plain radiograph of the left lower leg shows patchy areas of lytic bone and sclerosis within the femoral metaphysis. Which of the following is associated with the patient’s most likely diagnosis?
Options: 
1. Bitemporal hemianopsia
2. Hearing loss
3. Hypertension
4. Pheochromocytoma
5. Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia
Correct Answer: Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**

- **Patient Information:** An 18-month-old female child.
  
- **Chief Complaint:** Vaginal bleeding observed by the mother, characterized as brown discharge with clots.
  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**
  - Vaginal bleeding without known trauma, intact hymen.
  - History of limping and left leg pain since a fall 2 months prior.
  - Physical examination reveals multiple hyperpigmented patches (2-3 cm) on the trunk.
  - Bilateral breast enlargement without pubic hair.
  - Radiograph findings: Patchy areas of lytic bone and sclerosis within the femoral metaphysis.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**

- **Vaginal Bleeding in a Young Girl:** In an 18-month-old, vaginal bleeding is abnormal and suggests precocious puberty or other endocrine abnormalities. The presence of bilateral breast enlargement without pubic hair points towards peripheral precocious puberty, likely estrogen-secreting.

- **Hyperpigmented Patches on Trunk:** These could represent café-au-lait spots or other skin manifestations associated with genetic syndromes.

- **Bone Findings and History of Limb Pain:** The patchy lytic areas and sclerosis in the femoral metaphysis, along with a history of limb pain, raise concern for a bone dysplasia or fibrous dysplasia.

- **Integration of Symptoms:** The combination of precocious puberty, bone lesions, and hyperpigmented skin patches is suggestive of a syndromic condition, possibly McCune-Albright Syndrome (MAS), which is characterized by polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, café-au-lait spots, and endocrine abnormalities.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**

- **Option 1: Bitemporal hemianopsia**
  - **Association:** Typically linked with pituitary adenomas causing compression of the optic chiasm.
  - **Relevance:** Not directly related to the current clinical features. MAS does not commonly present with visual field defects.
  
- **Option 2: Hearing loss**
  - **Association:** Can be seen in conditions like Neurofibromatosis Type 2.
  - **Relevance:** No clinical signs or symptoms suggestive of hearing impairment in this case.

- **Option 3: Hypertension**
  - **Association:** May be seen in conditions like congenital adrenal hyperplasia or pheochromocytoma.
  - **Relevance:** Not directly linked to the presented symptoms. MAS can involve endocrine dysfunctions but hypertension is not a primary feature.

- **Option 4: Pheochromocytoma**
  - **Association:** A tumor of the adrenal medulla causing episodic hypertension, headaches, and palpitations.
  - **Relevance:** No symptoms indicative of pheochromocytoma are present.

- **Option 5: Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia**
  - **Association:** A bone disorder where normal bone is replaced with fibrous tissue, leading to bone pain, deformities, and fractures.
  - **Relevance:** Aligns with the patient's bone pain, radiographic findings, and is a component of MAS, which fits the overall clinical picture.

**4. Final Selection**

**My final selection is: Option 5 (Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia) (多发性纤维发育不良)**

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 18-month-old girl.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Vaginal bleeding (brown discharge with clots).  
- **Key Symptoms**:  
  - Limping and left leg pain for 2 months post-fall.  
  - Multiple hyperpigmented patches on the trunk.  
  - Bilateral breast enlargement without pubic hair.  
  - Normal vaginal orifice and hymen.  
- **Decisive Findings**:  
  - **Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia** (lytic bone lesions with sclerosis on femoral metaphysis).  
  - **Café-au-lait spots** (hyperpigmented patches).  
  - **Precocious puberty** (breast enlargement).  

---

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Bone Lesions**: The lytic and sclerotic areas in the femur are classic for **fibrous dysplasia**, which can cause pain and limping if affecting weight-bearing bones. The 2-month history of leg pain aligns with chronic bone involvement.  
- **Skin Hyperpigmentation**: The hyperpigmented patches are likely **café-au-lait spots**, a hallmark of **McCune-Albright syndrome** (MAS), which combines fibrous dysplasia, endocrine abnormalities, and skin pigmentation.  
- **Precocious Puberty**: Bilateral breast enlargement suggests estrogen excess, often due to **gonadal or adrenal tumors** in MAS. Vaginal bleeding may result from estrogen stimulation.  
- **Exclusion of Trauma/Coagulopathy**: No history of trauma or bleeding diathesis (denied easy bruising/nosebleeds) rules out hemorrhagic causes of vaginal bleeding.  

---

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (Bitemporal hemianopsia)**:  
  - Linked to pituitary tumors (e.g., prolactinoma) causing hormonal imbalances.  
  - **Unlikely**: Patient lacks visual symptoms, and MAS (the likely diagnosis) does not typically cause bitemporal hemianopsia.  

- **Option 2 (Hearing loss)**:  
  - Unrelated to the clinical features. Hearing loss is not a feature of MAS or fibrous dysplasia.  

- **Option 3 (Hypertension)**:  
  - Could occur in pheochromocytoma (Option 4) or renal artery stenosis.  
  - **Unlikely**: No hypertension is mentioned, and MAS does not directly cause hypertension.  

- **Option 4 (Pheochromocytoma)**:  
  - Causes episodic hypertension, palpitations, and sweating.  
  - **Unrelated**: No endocrine crisis symptoms are reported, and pheochromocytoma is not part of MAS.  

- **Option 5 (Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia)**:  
  - **Highly supportive**: Fibrous dysplasia (lytic bone lesions) combined with café-au-lait spots and precocious puberty is diagnostic of **McCune-Albright syndrome**.  
  - MAS is a classic triad of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, skin pigmentation, and endocrine abnormalities (e.g., precocious puberty).  

---

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 5 (Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia) (多发性纤维性发育不良)**  

**Key Evidence Supporting Choice**:  
- The **lytic bone lesions** on X-ray are pathognomonic for fibrous dysplasia.  
- **Café-au-lait spots** and **precocious puberty** complete the MAS triad.  
- No features support the other options (e.g., visual changes, hearing loss, hypertension, or pheochromocytoma).  
- MAS is the most likely diagnosis, with **polyostotic fibrous dysplasia** being its defining skeletal abnormality.

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 18-month-old girl.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Vaginal bleeding (brown discharge with clots).  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations**:  
  1. Vaginal bleeding without trauma, bruising, or coagulopathy.  
  2. Limping and left leg pain after a fall 2 months prior.  
  3. Multiple hyperpigmented trunk patches (2-3 cm).  
  4. Bilateral breast enlargement (thelarche) without pubic hair.  
  5. Radiographic findings: Patchy lytic/sclerotic bone lesions in the femoral metaphysis.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Vaginal Bleeding**: Uncommon in toddlers. Differential includes trauma, infection, precocious puberty, or hormonal activation. Intact hymen and lack of trauma oppose accidental injury.  
- **Bone Lesions**: Lytic/sclerotic metaphyseal lesions suggest **polyostotic fibrous dysplasia**, a hallmark of **McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS)**. The fall likely caused a pathological fracture due to weakened bone.  
- **Hyperpigmented Patches**: Likely café-au-lait macules with irregular borders ("coast of Maine"), characteristic of MAS.  
- **Breast Enlargement**: Reflects peripheral precocious puberty (estrogen secretion from ovarian cysts in MAS), explaining vaginal bleeding (mini-puberty/menstrual-like shedding).  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Bitemporal hemianopsia**: Pituitary adenoma-related visual field defect. No evidence of pituitary mass or visual symptoms. **Excluded**.  
2. **Hearing loss**: Associated with neurofibromatosis type 2 or osteopetrosis. Not relevant here. **Excluded**.  
3. **Hypertension**: Linked to renal disease or pheochromocytoma. No clinical signs (e.g., elevated BP, palpitations). **Excluded**.  
4. **Pheochromocytoma**: Causes episodic hypertension, sweating, and pallor. Absent in this case. **Excluded**.  
5. **Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia**: Core feature of MAS. Explains bone lesions, precocious puberty (vaginal bleeding, thelarche), and café-au-lait spots. **Strongly supported**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 5 (Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia)(多骨性纤维性发育不良)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  1. Radiographic lytic/sclerotic bone lesions typical of fibrous dysplasia.  
  2. Café-au-lait macules and precocious puberty align with MAS triad (polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, endocrine dysfunction, skin hyperpigmentation).  
  3. Vaginal bleeding correlates with estrogen-driven endometrial shedding from ovarian cysts in MAS.  
  4. Absence of trauma/coagulopathy supports a syndromic etiology.
