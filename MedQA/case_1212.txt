================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** 47-year-old female.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Follow-up after an emergency department (ED) visit for nephrolithiasis (kidney stone) one week prior.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - **Stone Details:** A 4-mm calcium oxalate stone occluded the right ureter, which the patient successfully passed over 5 hours without assistance.  
  - **Symptom Severity:** Experienced excruciating pain while passing the stone.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline:** The patient had an acute episode of nephrolithiasis one week ago, with the stone passing spontaneously.  
- **Stone Composition:** Calcium oxalate stones are the most common type of kidney stones, accounting for approximately 75-80% of cases.  
- **Risk Factors:** Dietary factors play a significant role in the formation of calcium oxalate stones. High sodium intake is associated with increased urinary calcium excretion, which can contribute to stone formation.  
- **Symptom Interrelation:** The acute pain experienced is typical of ureteral stone passage, particularly with stones around 4 mm in size, which have a reasonable likelihood of spontaneous passage.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Decreasing calcium intake**  
  - **Analysis:** Contrary to reducing stone risk, decreasing dietary calcium can increase oxalate absorption in the gut, potentially raising the risk of calcium oxalate stone formation. Current guidelines recommend maintaining normal calcium intake, preferably from dietary sources.
  
- **Option 2: Decreasing sodium intake**  
  - **Analysis:** High sodium intake is linked to increased urinary calcium excretion, a known risk factor for calcium oxalate stone formation. Reducing sodium intake can decrease calciuria, thereby lowering the risk of stone recurrence. Clinical guidelines support sodium restriction as a preventive measure for calcium stones.
  
- **Option 3: Increasing consumption of nuts and seeds**  
  - **Analysis:** Nuts and seeds are high in oxalate, which can contribute to the formation of calcium oxalate stones. Increasing their consumption may elevate oxalate levels in the urine, thereby increasing stone risk.
  
- **Option 4: Loop diuretic pharmacotherapy**  
  - **Analysis:** Loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) increase calcium excretion in the urine, which could exacerbate calcium stone formation. Thiazide diuretics, not loop diuretics, are typically used to reduce urinary calcium excretion in stone prevention.
  
- **Option 5: Urine acidification with cranberry juice**  
  - **Analysis:** Cranberry juice is primarily used for urinary tract infection prevention and can acidify the urine. However, calcium oxalate stone formation is not directly prevented by urine acidification. In fact, acidifying the urine may increase the risk of uric acid stone formation, not calcium oxalate stones.

**4. Final Selection**

**My final selection is: Option 2 (Decreasing sodium intake)(减少钠摄入)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 2 (Decreasing sodium intake)

Qwen's full response:

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 47-year-old female with a history of nephrolithiasis presented for follow-up after passing a 4-mm calcium oxalate stone from the right ureter.  
- Key symptoms included severe pain during stone passage, resolved after spontaneous passage.  
- The stone composition (calcium oxalate) and rapid passage (5 hours) are critical for determining preventive measures.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- Calcium oxalate stones are the most common type, accounting for ~80% of kidney stones.  
- The patient’s stone passed spontaneously, suggesting it was small (4 mm) and not causing prolonged obstruction.  
- Severe pain during passage is typical for ureteral colic due to distension and spasm.  
- Prevention strategies must address risk factors for calcium oxalate stone recurrence, such as hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria, and urine supersaturation.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (Decreasing calcium intake):** Contrary to intuition, restricting dietary calcium may increase oxalate absorption in the gut, raising urinary oxalate and stone risk. Current guidelines recommend maintaining normal calcium intake (1,000–1,200 mg/day) to bind intestinal oxalate.  
- **Option 2 (Decreasing sodium intake):** High sodium intake increases urinary calcium excretion, a key driver of calcium oxalate stone formation. Reducing sodium to <2,300 mg/day is a cornerstone of prevention, as it reduces urine calcium and stone recurrence.  
- **Option 3 (Increasing nuts/seeds):** Nuts and seeds are high in oxalate. Increasing their consumption could elevate urinary oxalate, worsening calcium oxalate stone risk. This is counterproductive.  
- **Option 4 (Loop diuretic pharmacotherapy):** Loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) increase urine calcium excretion, directly increasing stone risk. This is contraindicated for prevention.  
- **Option 5 (Urine acidification with cranberry juice):** Calcium oxalate stones form in neutral/alkaline urine. Acidifying urine (e.g., with cranberry juice) may paradoxically reduce their solubility, worsening recurrence. Alkalinization is preferred for cystine stones, not calcium oxalate.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Decreasing sodium intake)(减少钠摄入)**  

Key evidence: High sodium intake correlates with increased urinary calcium excretion, a critical factor in calcium oxalate stone formation. Reducing dietary sodium to <2,300 mg/day is strongly supported by clinical guidelines (e.g., American Urological Association) to lower recurrence risk. Other options either worsen oxalate absorption (Option 1), increase oxalate intake (Option 3), exacerbate hypercalciuria (Option 4), or acidify urine inappropriately (Option 5).

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 2 (Decreasing sodium intake)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 47-year-old female with recent episode of nephrolithiasis (calcium oxalate stone).  
- **Key Presentation**: Successfully passed a 4-mm right ureteral stone. Pathology confirms calcium oxalate composition.  
- **Primary Concern**: Seeks preventive measures to avoid recurrent renal calculi.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Stone Type**: Calcium oxalate stones account for ~80% of kidney stones. Prevention focuses on reducing urinary calcium and oxalate.  
- **Critical Risk Factors**: High dietary sodium increases urinary calcium excretion. High oxalate intake (e.g., nuts, spinach) promotes stone formation.  
- **Contraindications**:  
  - **Low calcium intake** paradoxically increases intestinal oxalate absorption, worsening stone risk.  
  - **Cranberry juice** contains oxalate and may acidify urine, but calcium oxalate stones form in acidic urine, making this ineffective or harmful.  
  - **Loop diuretics** (e.g., furosemide) increase urinary calcium excretion, whereas thiazides reduce it (not listed).  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Decreasing calcium intake** (减少钙摄入): **Contraindicated**. Normal calcium intake (1,000–1,200 mg/day) binds intestinal oxalate, reducing absorption.  
2. **Decreasing sodium intake** (减少钠摄入): **Strongly supported**. High sodium intake increases urinary calcium excretion. Guidelines recommend <2,300 mg/day sodium.  
3. **Increasing nuts/seeds** (增加坚果和种子摄入): **Harmful**. Nuts/seeds are high in oxalate, exacerbating stone risk.  
4. **Loop diuretic therapy** (袢利尿剂治疗): **Ineffective**. Increases urinary calcium; thiazides are preferred but not listed.  
5. **Urine acidification with cranberry juice** (蔓越莓汁酸化尿液): **Ineffective/Risky**. Cranberry juice is high in oxalate and may lower urine pH, favoring calcium oxalate crystallization.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Decreasing sodium intake)(减少钠摄入)**  
- **Key Evidence**: Sodium restriction reduces urinary calcium excretion, a major risk factor for calcium oxalate stones. This aligns with AUA/EAU guidelines recommending sodium restriction (<2,300 mg/day) as first-line prevention. Other options either increase stone risk (Options 1, 3, 5) or lack efficacy (Option 4).
