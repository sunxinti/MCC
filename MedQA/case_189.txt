================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Basic Information:** A 17-year-old woman presents with concerns about amenorrhea lasting 4 months.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Absence of menstrual periods for the past four months.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - **Menstrual History:** Previously regular menstruation since age 13, with the last two months showing irregularity leading to amenorrhea.  
  - **Physical Examination:**  
    - BMI of 21 kg/m², indicating a normal weight status.  
    - Enlarged cheeks bilaterally.  
    - Calluses on the dorsum of her hands.  
  - **Additional History:** Reports significant stress related to school and recent binge eating episodes.  
- **Decisive Symptoms and Signs:** Enlarged cheeks and calluses on the hands (Russell's sign) are particularly indicative of self-induced vomiting, commonly associated with bulimia nervosa.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline and Characteristics:** The patient had regular menstrual cycles until two months ago, with the last four months showing amenorrhea. The onset of amenorrhea coincides with recent psychological stress and binge eating behaviors.  
- **Physical Signs:**  
  - **Enlarged Cheeks:** May suggest parotid gland hypertrophy, often seen in individuals with bulimia who engage in frequent vomiting.  
  - **Calluses on Hands (Russell's Sign):** Indicative of self-induced vomiting, where repeated contact of the teeth with the dorsum of the hands causes calluses.  
- **Interrelationship of Symptoms:** The combination of amenorrhea, signs of purging (calluses), and possible binge eating behavior aligns with the diagnostic criteria for bulimia nervosa.  
- **Supporting Features:** Normal BMI does not rule out an eating disorder, as bulimia nervosa can occur in individuals with normal or above-normal body weight.  
- **Opposing Features:** Lack of reported sexual activity and a negative pregnancy test help rule out pregnancy-related amenorrhea.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Malar rash**  
  - **Relevance:** Malar rash is typically associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).  
  - **Alignment:** There are no other signs or symptoms (e.g., joint pain, photosensitivity) suggesting SLE.  
  - **Conclusion:** Unlikely related to the current presentation.

- **Option 2: Increased blood glucose level**  
  - **Relevance:** Elevated blood glucose is indicative of diabetes mellitus.  
  - **Alignment:** The patient's symptoms do not suggest diabetes (no polyuria, polyphagia, weight loss).  
  - **Conclusion:** Not aligned with the clinical picture.

- **Option 3: Erosion of tooth enamel**  
  - **Relevance:** Chronic self-induced vomiting in bulimia nervosa leads to exposure of teeth to stomach acid, causing enamel erosion.  
  - **Alignment:** Supports the presence of bulimia nervosa, especially with signs of purging (calluses on hands).  
  - **Conclusion:** Highly consistent with the patient's presentation.

- **Option 4: Enlarged thyroid**  
  - **Relevance:** Thyroid enlargement (goiter) is associated with thyroid disorders like hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.  
  - **Alignment:** There are no symptoms (e.g., fatigue, weight changes, heat/cold intolerance) indicative of thyroid dysfunction.  
  - **Conclusion:** Unrelated to the current symptoms.

- **Option 5: Elevated estrogen levels**  
  - **Relevance:** Typically, amenorrhea in eating disorders is associated with decreased estrogen levels due to hypothalamic suppression.  
  - **Alignment:** Elevated estrogen would not explain the amenorrhea; in fact, it's the opposite.  
  - **Conclusion:** Contradicts expected hormonal changes in the suspected condition.

Qwen is reasoning the answer...

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 3 (Erosion of tooth enamel)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 17-year-old woman presents with secondary amenorrhea (4 months) after regular menses since age 13.  
- Denies sexual activity; urine pregnancy test is negative.  
- Key physical findings: Bilateral enlarged cheeks ("moon face"), calluses on the dorsum of both hands, and a BMI of 21 kg/m².  
- Self-reported stress, recent binge eating.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Amenorrhea**: Likely due to hormonal disruption (e.g., hypercortisolism, eating disorder, or stress-related hypothalamic dysfunction).  
- **Moon Face (enlarged cheeks)**: A classic sign of Cushing’s syndrome, caused by excess cortisol.  
- **Calluses on hand dorsum**: Suggest repetitive trauma, possibly from self-induced vomiting (e.g., in bulimia nervosa), which causes "Russell’s sign" (calluses on knuckles/dorsum from purging).  
- **Stress and binge eating**: Could indicate an eating disorder (e.g., bulimia nervosa), which often coexists with enamel erosion from acid exposure.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (Malar rash)**: Seen in lupus (SLE), but lacks other SLE features (e.g., arthritis, photosensitivity). Unlikely to explain calluses.  
- **Option 2 (Increased blood glucose)**: Supports Cushing’s syndrome, as cortisol excess causes insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. However, the patient’s normal BMI complicates this.  
- **Option 3 (Erosion of tooth enamel)**: Strongly linked to bulimia nervosa, where purging (even if unadmitted) causes enamel erosion. The calluses on the hands align with purging behaviors.  
- **Option 4 (Enlarged thyroid)**: Seen in thyroid disorders (e.g., Graves’ disease), but unrelated to moon face or calluses.  
- **Option 5 (Elevated estrogen)**: Unlikely, as amenorrhea in this context is more likely due to cortisol/psychogenic causes rather than estrogen excess.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The calluses on the hand dorsum (Russell’s sign) and binge eating strongly suggest bulimia nervosa. Enamel erosion (option 3) is a hallmark of bulimia due to repeated acid exposure from vomiting. While Cushing’s syndrome could explain the moon face, the calluses and reported binge eating favor bulimia, making enamel erosion the most consistent finding.  

**My final selection is: Option 3 (Erosion of tooth enamel)(牙釉质侵蚀)**

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 3 (Erosion of tooth enamel)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 17-year-old woman with secondary amenorrhea (4 months), regular menses since age 13.  
- **Key Symptoms/Signs**:  
  - Negative pregnancy test, no sexual activity.  
  - BMI 21 kg/m² (normal).  
  - Bilateral enlarged cheeks, calluses on dorsum of hands (Russell’s sign).  
  - Recent binge eating and stress.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Amenorrhea**: Likely hypothalamic or behavioral origin, given stress and binge eating.  
- **Enlarged Cheeks**: Parotid gland hypertrophy, a classic sign of recurrent vomiting (e.g., in bulimia nervosa).  
- **Calluses on Hands (Russell’s Sign)**: Caused by self-induced vomiting using fingers.  
- **Binge Eating**: Suggests disordered eating behavior, aligning with bulimia nervosa.  
- **BMI 21**: Not underweight, making anorexia nervosa less likely but consistent with bulimia.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Malar Rash (Option 1)**: Butterfly rash (e.g., lupus) differs from parotid enlargement; no systemic autoimmune symptoms noted. **Unlikely**.  
2. **Increased Blood Glucose (Option 2)**: No polyuria, polydipsia, or weight loss. Binge eating may cause transient hyperglycemia but not diagnostic. **Unlikely**.  
3. **Erosion of Tooth Enamel (Option 3)**: Directly linked to recurrent vomiting (stomach acid erodes enamel). Strongly aligns with bulimia. **Highly Likely**.  
4. **Enlarged Thyroid (Option 4)**: No signs of thyroid dysfunction (e.g., weight changes, heat intolerance). **Unlikely**.  
5. **Elevated Estrogen (Option 5)**: Hypothalamic amenorrhea typically causes low estrogen, not elevated. **Contradicts**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Erosion of tooth enamel)(牙釉质侵蚀)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Binge eating, Russell’s sign, and parotid hypertrophy strongly suggest bulimia nervosa.  
  - Chronic vomiting in bulimia leads to acidic erosion of tooth enamel, a hallmark physical finding.  
  - Other options lack pathophysiological consistency with the clinical scenario.
