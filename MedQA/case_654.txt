Case_description: 
A mother brings her 18-year-old daughter to your office because she has not menstruated yet. They recently immigrated from another country, and do not have any previous medical records. The adolescent girl looks relatively short, but otherwise looks healthy. She has no complaints except for mild intermittent lower abdominal pain for the past year. On physical examination, vitals are within normal limits. There is the presence of axillary hair, breast development, and pubic hair at Tanner stage 5. You explain to the mother and the patient that you need to perform a complete vaginal examination, however, both of them declined the procedure and would prefer that lab test be performed. Her labs are significant for the following:
FSH 7 mIU/mL
Normal values:  
   Follicular phase 3.1 – 7.9 mIU/mL
   Ovulation peak 2.3 – 18.5 mIU/mL
   Luteal phase 1.4 – 5.5 mIU/mL
   Postmenopausal 30.6 – 106.3 mIU/mL
Estradiol 28 pg/mL
Normal values:  
   Mid-follicular phase 27 – 123 pg/mL
   Periovulatory 96 – 436 pg/mL
   Mid-luteal phase 49 – 294 pg/mL
   Postmenopausal 0 – 40 pg/mL
Testosterone 52 ng/dL, 40 – 60 ng/dL

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**
- **Patient Information:** An 18-year-old female immigrant with no prior medical records.
- **Chief Complaint:** Primary amenorrhea (absence of menstruation) and mild intermittent lower abdominal pain for the past year.
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**
  - **Physical Appearance:** Relatively short stature but otherwise healthy.
  - **Pubertal Development:** Presence of axillary hair, breast development, and pubic hair at Tanner stage 5, indicating normal secondary sexual characteristics.
  - **Laboratory Findings:**
    - **FSH:** 7 mIU/mL (within the normal follicular phase range).
    - **Estradiol:** 28 pg/mL (low end of the mid-follicular phase range).
    - **Testosterone:** 52 ng/dL (within normal limits).

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**
- **Primary Amenorrhea:** Defined as the absence of menstruation by age 15 with secondary sexual characteristics or by age 13 without them. This patient is 18 and has developed secondary sexual features, fitting the primary amenorrhea category.
- **Normal Secondary Sexual Characteristics:** The presence of axillary hair, breast development, and Tanner stage 5 pubic hair suggests normal estrogen effect and androgen presence, which may rule out conditions like androgen insensitivity.
- **Short Stature:** This can be associated with several conditions, including Turner syndrome, Müllerian agenesis, or chronic illnesses.
- **Laboratory Results:**
  - **FSH:** Within the normal range for the follicular phase, suggesting that ovarian function may not be impaired.
  - **Estradiol:** On the lower end of normal, possibly reflecting reduced ovarian estrogen production.
  - **Testosterone:** Normal levels, indicating no hyperandrogenism or androgen resistance.
- **Abdominal Pain:** Mild intermittent lower abdominal pain may suggest anatomical anomalies such as Müllerian agenesis or other structural issues.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**
1. **Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI):**
   - **Likelihood:** POI typically presents with elevated FSH levels due to ovarian failure, which is not consistent with the patient's normal FSH.
   - **Conclusion:** Less likely.

2. **Müllerian Agenesis:**
   - **Likelihood:** Characterized by primary amenorrhea, normal secondary sexual characteristics, and normal ovarian function, aligning with the patient’s presentation. Short stature can also be a feature.
   - **Additional Consideration:** Absence or malformation of the uterus and upper vagina, which could explain the inability to perform a vaginal examination and intermittent abdominal pain due to possible hematocolpos or related issues.
   - **Conclusion:** Highly likely.

3. **Hyperprolactinemia:**
   - **Likelihood:** Typically presents with amenorrhea and galactorrhea, which are not observed in this patient.
   - **Conclusion:** Unlikely.

4. **Turner Syndrome:**
   - **Likelihood:** Often presents with primary amenorrhea, short stature, and ovarian failure leading to elevated FSH, which does not match the patient's normal FSH levels.
   - **Conclusion:** Less likely.

5. **Androgen Insensitivity:**
   - **Likelihood:** Usually presents in individuals with a female phenotype but undescended testes, absent pubic and axillary hair (due to androgen resistance). This patient has normal pubic and axillary hair.
   - **Conclusion:** Unlikely.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Müllerian agenesis)(穆勒管发育不全)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 2 (Muellerian agenesis)

Qwen's full response:

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- An 18-year-old female with primary amenorrhea, normal pubertal development (Tanner stage 5), and mild intermittent lower abdominal pain for one year.  
- Key symptoms: Absence of menstruation, short stature, and abdominal pain.  
- Decisive clinical features: Normal secondary sexual characteristics (breast and pubic/axillary hair development), normal FSH and estradiol levels, and anatomical concerns (declined vaginal exam).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Primary Amenorrhea**: The absence of menstruation by age 16 with normal secondary sexual characteristics or by age 14 without secondary sexual characteristics. Here, the patient has Tanner stage 5 development, suggesting functional ovaries but an anatomical obstruction.  
- **Normal Hormonal Profile**: FSH (7 mIU/mL) and estradiol (28 pg/mL) are within normal follicular phase ranges, ruling out primary ovarian dysfunction (e.g., POI). Testosterone is also within the normal range.  
- **Abdominal Pain**: Mild intermittent pain may indicate uterine contractions without menstrual outflow, consistent with an anatomical defect like Müllerian agenesis.  
- **Short Stature**: While suggestive of Turner syndrome, FSH levels in Turner are typically elevated, which is not the case here.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI)**: Unlikely due to normal FSH and estradiol levels. POI is characterized by elevated FSH (>25 mIU/mL) and low estradiol.  
2. **Muellerian Agenesis (MRKH)**: Strongly supported. The patient has normal pubertal development (indicating functional ovaries) but no menstruation, consistent with absence of the uterus/vagina. Abdominal pain may arise from a rudimentary uterus. Labs align with normal ovarian function.  
3. **Hyperprolactinemia**: No elevated prolactin levels were reported, and FSH is normal. Unlikely.  
4. **Turner Syndrome**: Short stature is a feature, but FSH would typically be elevated due to gonadal dysgenesis. Normal FSH and estradiol make this less likely unless mosaic Turner (rare and less likely to present with normal pubertal development).  
5. **Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS)**: Partial AIS might allow some breast development but would not explain normal estradiol levels or abdominal pain. Complete AIS would lack secondary sexual characteristics, which the patient does not.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Muellerian agenesis)(子宫缺失症)**

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 2 (Muellerian agenesis)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 18-year-old female with primary amenorrhea, Tanner stage 5 breast/axillary/pubic hair development, mild intermittent lower abdominal pain for 1 year.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Normal secondary sexual characteristics (Tanner 5).  
  - Normal FSH (7 mIU/mL), estradiol (28 pg/mL), and testosterone (52 ng/dL).  
  - Declined vaginal examination.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Tanner Stage 5**: Confirms complete puberty, ruling out disorders causing delayed puberty (e.g., Turner syndrome).  
- **Normal FSH/Estradiol**: Indicates functional ovaries, excluding primary ovarian insufficiency (POI, which requires elevated FSH).  
- **Normal Testosterone**: Rules out androgen excess or androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS; testosterone in AIS would be male-range).  
- **Abdominal Pain**: Suggests possible outflow obstruction (e.g., functional endometrium in a rudimentary uterine structure).  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI)**  
  - **Contradicted**: Normal FSH/estradiol excludes ovarian failure.  
- **Option 2: Muellerian Agenesis (MRKH)**  
  - **Supported**: Normal ovarian function (FSH/estradiol), Tanner 5, and abdominal pain (possible cyclic hematometra in rudimentary uterus). Absent uterus/vagina explains amenorrhea.  
- **Option 3: Hyperprolactinemia**  
  - **Unlikely**: No galactorrhea or prolactin data; normal FSH/estradiol suggests intact hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis.  
- **Option 4: Turner Syndrome**  
  - **Contradicted**: Tanner 5 development and normal FSH/height (short stature alone is nonspecific).  
- **Option 5: Androgen Insensitivity (AIS)**  
  - **Contradicted**: Presence of pubic/axillary hair (androgen-dependent) and normal female-range testosterone.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Muellerian agenesis)(苗勒管发育不全)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Normal ovarian function (FSH/estradiol) with primary amenorrhea.  
  - Tanner 5 development confirms intact ovarian hormone production.  
  - Abdominal pain aligns with possible functional endometrium in a rudimentary uterine structure.  
  - Absent uterus/vagina (Muellerian agenesis) is the most likely structural cause.
