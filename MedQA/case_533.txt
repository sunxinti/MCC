Case_id: case_533
Case_description: 
A 36-year-old woman presents with increased tiredness and lethargy for the past 4 weeks. Investigations show her hemoglobin level to be 8.6 gm/dL and serum creatinine of 4.6 mg/dL. The serum is negative for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and positive for C3 nephritic factor. Urinalysis shows a 3+ proteinuria. The renal biopsy demonstrates hypercellular glomerulus with electron dense deposits along the glomerular basement membrane. What is the most likely cause?
Options: 
1. Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN)
2. Membrano proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN)
3. Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN)
4. Minimal change disease
5. Membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN)

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** 36-year-old woman.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Increased tiredness and lethargy for the past 4 weeks.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - **Laboratory Findings:**
    - Hemoglobin: 8.6 gm/dL (anemia)
    - Serum creatinine: 4.6 mg/dL (indicating renal dysfunction)
    - Negative for antinuclear antibodies (ANA)
    - Positive for C3 nephritic factor
  - **Urinalysis:** 3+ proteinuria
  - **Renal Biopsy:** Hypercellular glomeruli with electron-dense deposits along the glomerular basement membrane (GBM)

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Anemia and Renal Dysfunction:** The presence of anemia and elevated serum creatinine suggests significant renal impairment, likely due to glomerular disease affecting erythropoietin production or causing hemolytic anemia.
- **Positive C3 Nephritic Factor:** C3 nephritic factor stabilizes the alternative complement pathway C3 convertase, leading to persistent complement activation and consumption of C3. This is often associated with certain types of glomerulonephritis.
- **Proteinuria:** 3+ proteinuria indicates significant protein loss, which can be seen in various glomerular diseases, both nephritic and nephrotic syndromes.
- **Renal Biopsy Findings:** Hypercellular glomeruli suggest an active inflammatory process. Electron-dense deposits along the GBM are indicative of immune complex deposition or other types of deposits altering the glomerular structure.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Poststreptococcal Glomerulonephritis (PSGN):** Typically presents with low C3 due to complement consumption, often follows a streptococcal infection by 1-3 weeks. The patient's timeline (4 weeks) is slightly prolonged, and positive C3 nephritic factor is not characteristic of PSGN.  
2. **Membrano Proliferative Glomerulonephritis (MPGN):** Characterized by hypercellular glomeruli and immune complex deposition with electron-dense deposits. Positive C3 nephritic factor is associated with MPGN, particularly type II (dense deposit disease). This aligns well with the patient's findings.  
3. **Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis (RPGN):** Defined by rapid loss of renal function over days to weeks, often with crescent formation on biopsy. While the patient has elevated creatinine, the biopsy does not mention crescents, making RPGN less likely.  
4. **Minimal Change Disease:** Primarily presents with nephrotic syndrome and selective proteinuria with minimal changes on light microscopy and effacement of foot processes on electron microscopy, lacking electron-dense deposits. This does not align with the patient's findings.  
5. **Membranous Glomerulonephritis (MGN):** Characterized by subepithelial immune complex deposits and nephrotic syndrome. While proteinuria is present, the presence of hypercellularity and positive C3 nephritic factor are not typical features of MGN.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Membrano proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN)) (膜增生性肾小球肾炎)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 2 (Membrano proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN))

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 36-year-old woman presents with 4 weeks of fatigue and lethargy.  
- Key lab findings: hemoglobin 8.6 g/dL (anemia), serum creatinine 4.6 mg/dL (severe renal impairment), 3+ proteinuria, ANA negative, and C3 nephritic factor positive.  
- Renal biopsy shows hypercellular glomeruli with electron-dense deposits along the glomerular basement membrane (GBM).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Clinical Presentation**: The chronicity (4 weeks) of symptoms and severe renal dysfunction (elevated creatinine) suggest a progressive glomerulonephritis rather than an acute post-infectious process like PSGN.  
- **Laboratory Findings**:  
  - **C3 nephritic factor positivity**: This is a critical clue, as it is strongly associated with Type II membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN).  
  - **Negative ANA**: Rules out lupus nephritis, a common differential in proliferative glomerulonephritis.  
- **Biopsy Findings**:  
  - **Hypercellular glomeruli**: Suggests active proliferation, seen in MPGN and RPGN.  
  - **Electron-dense deposits along the GBM**: In MPGN, these deposits are typically intramembranous (Type I) or dense deposits within the GBM (Type II). The presence of C3 nephritic factor points to Type II MPGN.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN)**  
  - **Unlikely**: PSGN is acute (days to weeks), typically follows streptococcal infection, and shows subepithelial hump-shaped deposits (not intramembranous). C3 nephritic factor is absent. Chronicity and C3 factor exclude this.  

- **Option 2: Membrano proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN)**  
  - **Highly Likely**:  
    - **Type II MPGN** is strongly linked to C3 nephritic factor.  
    - Electron-dense deposits along the GBM and hypercellular glomeruli align with MPGN.  
    - Chronic kidney dysfunction and lack of crescents (seen in RPGN) support this.  

- **Option 3: Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN)**  
  - **Unlikely**: RPGN presents with crescents on biopsy (not described here) and rapid decline in renal function over days to weeks. C3 nephritic factor is not a hallmark.  

- **Option 4: Minimal change disease (MCD)**  
  - **Excluded**: MCD lacks histologic deposits and typically presents with nephrotic syndrome (proteinuria >3.5 g/day, hypoalbuminemia, edema). Electron microscopy in MCD shows podocyte foot process effacement, not electron-dense deposits.  

- **Option 5: Membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN)**  
  - **Less Likely**: MGN shows subepithelial deposits, not intramembranous. C3 nephritic factor is absent in MGN.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Membrano proliferative glomerulonephritis) (膜增生性肾小球肾炎)**

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 2 (Membrano proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN))

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Profile**: 36-year-old woman with 4 weeks of fatigue and lethargy.  
- **Key Findings**:  
  - **Anemia**: Hemoglobin 8.6 gm/dL.  
  - **Renal Dysfunction**: Serum creatinine 4.6 mg/dL.  
  - **Serology**: ANA-negative, C3 nephritic factor (C3NeF)-positive.  
  - **Urinalysis**: 3+ proteinuria.  
  - **Renal Biopsy**: Hypercellular glomeruli with electron-dense deposits along the glomerular basement membrane (GBM).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Renal Insufficiency**: Elevated creatinine (4.6 mg/dL) and anemia suggest chronic kidney disease.  
- **Proteinuria**: 3+ indicates nephrotic/nephritic overlap.  
- **C3NeF Positivity**: Strongly linked to **membrano proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) type II** (dense deposit disease).  
- **Biopsy Findings**: Hypercellularity and dense deposits along the GBM are classic for MPGN.  
- **Negative ANA**: Reduces likelihood of lupus nephritis.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **PSGN**: Typically post-streptococcal, pediatric, with subepithelial "humps" on biopsy. C3NeF is absent. **Unlikely**.  
2. **MPGN**: C3NeF positivity, hypercellularity, and dense deposits align with type II MPGN. **Highly consistent**.  
3. **RPGN**: Rapid creatinine rise with crescents on biopsy. Absent here. **Excluded**.  
4. **Minimal Change Disease**: No hypercellularity or deposits. **Excluded**.  
5. **MGN**: Subepithelial deposits without hypercellularity. C3NeF not associated. **Unlikely**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Membrano proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN)) (膜增生性肾小球肾炎)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - C3 nephritic factor positivity strongly supports MPGN type II.  
  - Biopsy findings (hypercellularity, dense deposits along GBM) confirm MPGN.  
  - Clinical triad of proteinuria, renal dysfunction, and hypocomplementemia (implied by C3NeF) matches MPGN.
