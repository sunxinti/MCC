Case_description: 
A 60-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of sudden, painless loss of vision in her right eye that occurred 30 minutes ago while watching TV. She has coronary artery disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus; she has had trouble adhering to her medication regimen. Her blood pressure is 160/85 mm Hg. Examination shows 20/50 vision in the left eye and no perception of light in the right eye. Direct pupillary reflex is present in the left eye, but absent in the right eye. Accommodation is intact bilaterally. Intraocular pressure is 16 mm Hg in the left eye and 18 mm Hg in the right eye. Fundoscopic examination of the right eye shows a pale, white retina with a bright red area within the macula. The optic disc appears normal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options: 
1. Central retinal vein occlusion
2. Retinal detachment
3. Central retinal artery occlusion
4. Acute angle-closure glaucoma
5. Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**
- **Patient Profile:** A 60-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She has difficulty adhering to her medication regimen.
- **Chief Complaint:** Sudden, painless loss of vision in her right eye occurring 30 minutes prior while watching TV.
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**
  - **Visual Acuity:** 20/50 in the left eye; no perception of light in the right eye.
  - **Pupillary Reflex:** Present in the left eye; absent in the right eye.
  - **Accommodation:** Intact bilaterally.
  - **Intraocular Pressure (IOP):** 16 mm Hg (left eye), 18 mm Hg (right eye).
  - **Fundoscopic Examination (Right Eye):** Pale, white retina with a bright red area within the macula (cherry-red spot). Optic disc appears normal.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**
- **Onset and Timeline:** The vision loss occurred suddenly and acutely, within 30 minutes.
- **Pain:** The absence of pain is significant in narrowing down the differential diagnoses.
- **Visual Acuity:** Complete loss of light perception in the right eye suggests a severe and acute vascular or neural event.
- **Pupillary Reflex:** The absence of a direct pupillary reflex in the right eye indicates impaired afferent pathways, often associated with retinal or optic nerve pathology.
- **Intraocular Pressure:** Normal IOP in both eyes makes acute angle-closure glaucoma unlikely as it typically presents with elevated IOP.
- **Fundoscopic Findings:** A pale retina with a cherry-red spot is a classic sign associated with central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). The cherry-red spot occurs due to the contrast between the ischemic retina and the underlying choroidal circulation at the macula.
- **Optic Disc:** A normal optic disc suggests that there is no immediate optic nerve head swelling, which can be seen in some optic neuropathies.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**
1. **Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO):**
   - **Likelihood:** Low. CRVO typically presents with a "blood and thunder" appearance due to retinal hemorrhages, dilated veins, and cotton-wool spots, which are not described in this case.
2. **Retinal Detachment:**
   - **Likelihood:** Low. Retinal detachment often presents with symptoms like flashes of light, floaters, or a "curtain" coming over the vision, which are not reported here.
3. **Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO):**
   - **Likelihood:** High. CRAO is characterized by sudden, painless monocular vision loss, a cherry-red spot on fundoscopy, and normal or slightly elevated IOP. The patient's presentation aligns closely with these features.
4. **Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma:**
   - **Likelihood:** Very Low. This condition typically presents with acute eye pain, headache, nausea, and significantly elevated IOP, none of which are present in this case.
5. **Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (AION):**
   - **Likelihood:** Moderate but less likely. AION can present with sudden vision loss and an altitudinal defect, but the classic cherry-red spot is more indicative of CRAO.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Central retinal artery occlusion)(中央视网膜动脉阻塞)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 3 (Central retinal artery occlusion)

Qwen's full response:

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 60-year-old woman with coronary artery disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes presents with sudden, painless loss of vision in her right eye (no light perception) that occurred 30 minutes prior.  
- Key clinical findings: Absent direct pupillary reflex in the right eye, intact accommodation bilaterally, intraocular pressure of 18 mm Hg in the right eye, and fundoscopic examination revealing a pale, white retina with a bright red macular area (cherry-red spot) and a normal optic disc.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Sudden onset and painless vision loss**: CRAO typically presents with abrupt, painless monocular vision loss, aligning with the timeline (30 minutes) and symptom profile.  
- **Cherry-red macula**: A hallmark of CRAO due to central retinal artery occlusion causing retinal ischemia, with the macula spared initially due to choroidal perfusion.  
- **Absent direct pupillary reflex (Marcus Gunn pupil)**: Indicates afferent pathway blockage in the affected eye, consistent with CRAO.  
- **Normal optic disc**: Differentiates CRAO from optic neuritis or AION, where optic disc swelling or atrophy may be present.  
- **Risk factors**: Poorly controlled hypertension and diabetes increase the risk of vascular occlusion.  
- **Intraocular pressure (IOP)**: Elevated IOP in the right eye (18 mm Hg) is not severe enough to support acute angle-closure glaucoma (typically >30 mm Hg).  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **1. Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO)**:  
  - Less likely due to absence of hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots, or optic disc edema. Cherry-red spot is absent in CRVO.  
- **2. Retinal detachment**:  
  - Typically presents with floaters, flashes, and a curtain-like visual defect. Fundus exam would show retinal elevation, not a cherry-red spot.  
- **3. Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO)**:  
  - Best aligns with findings: sudden painless vision loss, cherry-red macula, absent pupillary reflex, and normal optic disc. Risk factors (hypertension, diabetes) support this.  
- **4. Acute angle-closure glaucoma**:  
  - Excluded due to lack of severe pain, nausea, conjunctival injection, and IOP <30 mm Hg.  
- **5. Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION)**:  
  - Presents with painless vision loss but usually involves optic disc edema or atrophy. Cherry-red spot is absent. Timing (sudden vs. gradual over hours) is less typical.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Central retinal artery occlusion)(视网膜中央动脉阻塞)**

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 60-year-old woman with coronary artery disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes (medication non-adherent).  
- **Chief Complaint**: Sudden, painless vision loss in the right eye (30 minutes duration).  
- **Key Findings**:  
  - **Right eye**: No light perception, absent direct pupillary reflex, pale/white retina with a bright red macular spot ("cherry-red spot"), normal optic disc, intraocular pressure (IOP) 18 mmHg.  
  - **Left eye**: 20/50 vision, intact direct pupillary reflex, IOP 16 mmHg.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Sudden, painless vision loss**: Strongly suggests vascular etiology (e.g., retinal artery/vein occlusion).  
- **Pale retina with cherry-red spot**: Pathognomonic for **central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO)** due to ischemic retinal whitening sparing the thin macula.  
- **Absent direct pupillary reflex (right eye)**: Indicates severe retinal or optic nerve dysfunction, consistent with acute ischemia.  
- **Normal IOP and optic disc**: Excludes acute angle-closure glaucoma and anterior ischemic optic neuropathy.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO)**: Presents with retinal hemorrhages, tortuous veins ("blood and thunder" appearance). Absent here. **Excluded**.  
2. **Retinal detachment**: Associated with photopsia, floaters, or "curtain-like" vision loss. Fundoscopy would show retinal folds/tears. **Excluded**.  
3. **Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO)**: Matches all findings: sudden painless vision loss, cherry-red spot, pale retina, and vascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes). **Strongly supported**.  
4. **Acute angle-closure glaucoma**: Causes severe eye pain, nausea, elevated IOP (>40 mmHg), and corneal edema. Normal IOP and lack of pain **exclude** this.  
5. **Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION)**: Presents with optic disc edema and altitudinal vision loss. Normal optic disc and cherry-red spot **exclude** AION.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Central retinal artery occlusion)(视网膜中央动脉阻塞)**  
- **Key Evidence**: Sudden painless vision loss, cherry-red spot with pale retina, absent direct pupillary reflex, and vascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, atherosclerosis). Normal IOP and optic disc rule out glaucoma and AION.
