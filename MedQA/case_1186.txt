**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**

- **Patient Information:** A 65-year-old man.
- **Chief Complaint:** Pain in the left thigh for one week.
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**
  - **Pain Characteristics:** Dull, constant, deep below the thigh muscle, worse at night.
  - **Physical Examination:** Tenderness and warmth over the anterior aspect of the left thigh.
  - **Radiological Findings:** Plain radiograph shows increased cortical thickness with widened intercortical space of the left femur.
  - **Laboratory Studies:**
    - Alkaline phosphatase: 925 U/L (elevated)
    - Serum calcium: 9.2 mg/dL (normal)
    - Serum phosphorus: 4.4 mg/dL (normal)
  - **Bone Biopsy:** Provided image (not visible in this context).

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**

The patient presents with localized thigh pain that is dull and constant, exacerbated at night, along with tenderness and warmth in the affected area. The radiograph findings of increased cortical thickness and widened intercortical space suggest abnormal bone remodeling. Significantly elevated alkaline phosphatase indicates heightened bone turnover activity. The normal serum calcium and phosphorus levels help narrow down the differential diagnoses by excluding certain metabolic bone diseases.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**

1. **Osteomalacia:**
   - **Characteristics:** Defective bone mineralization due to vitamin D deficiency.
   - **Supporting Features:** Bone pain.
   - **Contrary Features:** Typically presents with low serum calcium and/or phosphorus, which are normal in this patient. Therefore, osteomalacia is less likely.

2. **Ewing's Sarcoma:**
   - **Characteristics:** Malignant bone tumor more common in children and adolescents.
   - **Supporting Features:** Bone pain.
   - **Contrary Features:** The patient's age (65) and radiographic features (increased cortical thickness) are not typical for Ewing's sarcoma, making this diagnosis unlikely.

3. **Osteitis Deformans (Paget's Disease of Bone):**
   - **Characteristics:** Chronic disorder characterized by excessive bone remodeling, leading to bone pain, deformities, and elevated alkaline phosphatase.
   - **Supporting Features:**
     - Elevated alkaline phosphatase with normal calcium and phosphorus.
     - Radiographic findings of increased cortical thickness and bone enlargement.
     - Age demographic fits (typically diagnosed in older adults).
   - **Contrary Features:** None significant; aligns well with the presented case.

4. **Osteochondritis Dissecans:**
   - **Characteristics:** Joint disorder affecting the articular cartilage and subchondral bone.
   - **Supporting Features:** Joint pain and potential locking/catching of the joint.
   - **Contrary Features:** Does not align with the deep thigh pain and radiographic findings in this patient.

5. **Osteitis Fibrosa Cystica:**
   - **Characteristics:** Bone disease resulting from hyperparathyroidism, characterized by bone resorption and cyst formation.
   - **Supporting Features:** Bone pain.
   - **Contrary Features:** Typically associated with elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels and low serum calcium and phosphorus, which are not present in this patient.

**4. Final Selection**

**My final selection is: Option 3 (Osteitis deformans)(骨炎变形症)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 3 (Osteitis deformans)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 65-year-old man presents with left thigh pain lasting a week, described as dull, constant, and worsening at night. Pain is localized deep beneath the thigh muscle.  
- Physical exam reveals tenderness and warmth over the anterior left thigh.  
- Radiographic findings show increased cortical thickness and widened intercortical space in the left femur.  
- Laboratory results: markedly elevated alkaline phosphatase (925 U/L), normal serum calcium (9.2 mg/dL), and slightly low serum phosphorus (4.4 mg/dL).  
- Key features: nocturnal pain, elevated ALP, and characteristic bone changes on imaging.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Nocturnal pain**: Often associated with bone turnover disorders (e.g., Paget’s disease) or malignancies (e.g., Ewing’s sarcoma).  
- **Elevated alkaline phosphatase**: A hallmark of bone remodeling, seen in Paget’s disease, osteitis fibrosa cystica, or malignant bone lesions.  
- **Radiographic findings**: Cortical thickening and widened intercortical space suggest active bone remodeling, consistent with Paget’s disease.  
- **Normal calcium**: Rules out primary hyperparathyroidism (osteitis fibrosa cystica) but does not exclude other diagnoses.  
- **Slightly low phosphorus**: Mild hypophosphatemia may occur in Paget’s due to increased bone resorption, but is less prominent than in osteomalacia.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **1. Osteomalacia**:  
  - Characterized by low bone mineralization (vitamin D deficiency or phosphate depletion).  
  - Presents with diffuse bone pain, waddling gait, and pathologic fractures.  
  - Labs: Low phosphorus (<2.5 mg/dL) and elevated ALP. Here, phosphorus is near normal, making this unlikely.  

- **2. Ewing’s sarcoma**:  
  - Aggressive bone malignancy in adolescents/young adults, but possible in older adults.  
  - Classic imaging: lytic lesions with "sunburst" or "onion-skin" periosteal reaction.  
  - Pain is severe and nocturnal, but X-ray findings here are more consistent with Paget’s.  

- **3. Osteitis deformans (Paget’s disease)**:  
  - Chronic bone disorder with increased osteoclastic and osteoblastic activity.  
  - Radiographic features: cortical thickening ("thickened cortex"), widened intercortical space, and "cotton wool" appearance.  
  - Labs: Elevated ALP (due to osteoblastic activity), normal or slightly low phosphorus.  
  - **Best fits**: Age, ALP elevation, and imaging. Nocturnal pain may occur due to increased bone turnover.  

- **4. Osteochondritis dissecans**:  
  - Affects joints (e.g., knee), causing pain and swelling.  
  - Unrelated to thigh bone pain or elevated ALP.  

- **5. Osteitis fibrosa cystica**:  
  - Secondary to hyperparathyroidism, causing cystic bone lesions.  
  - Labs: High calcium, low phosphorus, and elevated PTH. Here, calcium is normal, making this unlikely.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Osteitis deformans)(骨变形性骨炎)**

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 3 (Osteitis deformans)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 65-year-old man.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Left thigh pain (dull, constant, "boring" quality, worse at night) for 1 week.  
- **Key Findings**:  
  - Localized tenderness and warmth over the anterior thigh.  
  - Radiograph: Increased cortical thickness and widened intercortical space in the left femur.  
  - Labs: Markedly elevated alkaline phosphatase (925 U/L), normal serum calcium (9.2 mg/dL) and phosphorus (4.4 mg/dL).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Pain Characteristics**: Night-predominant, deep, and boring pain suggests a metabolic or structural bone disorder rather than musculoskeletal strain.  
- **Imaging**: Increased cortical thickness and widened intercortical space indicate abnormal bone remodeling.  
- **Laboratory**: Elevated alkaline phosphatase with normal calcium/phosphate strongly points to a high bone turnover state without systemic mineral imbalance.  
- **Contradictions**: Normal calcium/phosphate rules out hyperparathyroidism (opposes osteitis fibrosa cystica). Absence of joint involvement or trauma opposes osteochondritis dissecans.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Osteomalacia**: Unlikely. Typically presents with diffuse bone pain, fractures, and hypocalcemia/hypophosphatemia. Normal calcium/phosphate and focal radiographic changes do not align.  
2. **Ewing’s Sarcoma**: Unlikely. Rare in elderly patients; radiographs typically show lytic lesions, periosteal reaction ("onion skinning"), or soft tissue masses.  
3. **Osteitis Deformans (Paget’s disease)**: Highly likely. Classic triad of bone pain, elevated alkaline phosphatase, and radiologic findings (cortical thickening, "cotton wool" appearance). Night pain and warmth correlate with increased vascularity in pagetic bone.  
4. **Osteochondritis Dissecans**: Excluded. Affects joints (e.g., knee), not the femoral shaft, and typically occurs in younger individuals.  
5. **Osteitis Fibrosa Cystica**: Excluded. Caused by hyperparathyroidism, which would manifest with hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and subperiosteal resorption on X-ray.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Osteitis deformans)(畸形性骨炎)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Elevated alkaline phosphatase + normal calcium/phosphate = hallmark of Paget’s disease.  
  - Radiographic findings (cortical thickening, widened intercortical space) match pagetic bone remodeling.  
  - Clinical features (age, night pain, localized warmth/tenderness) align with Paget’s pathophysiology.
