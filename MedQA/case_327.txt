**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** A 22-year-old male from Nepal.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Swelling and pain in the right testicle.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - Recent immigration to the United States to live with his monogamous wife.  
  - Denies painful urination or urethral discharge, which reduces the likelihood of typical sexually transmitted infections like epididymo-orchitis caused by sexually acquired pathogens.  
  - History of feeling feverish and experiencing swelling and pain on the right side of his face 10 days prior, suggesting a possible viral infection affecting the salivary glands.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline:** The patient’s recent facial swelling and pain occurred approximately 10 days before the onset of testicular symptoms. This temporal relationship suggests a potential viral infection that initially presented with parotitis followed by orchitis.  
- **Facial Swelling and Pain:** These symptoms are characteristic of parotitis, which is most commonly caused by mumps virus infection, especially in unvaccinated individuals.  
- **Testicular Swelling and Pain:** Orchitis is a known complication of mumps infection, particularly in post-pubertal males, and typically presents with unilateral testicular pain and swelling.  
- **Absence of Urogenital Symptoms:** The lack of dysuria or urethral discharge makes sexually transmitted infections like gonococcal or non-gonococcal epididymo-orchitis less likely.  
- **Travel History:** Coming from Nepal may indicate a lower likelihood of prior vaccination against mumps, increasing susceptibility to mumps infection.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Preventable by a live attenuated vaccine**  
  - **Analysis:** Mumps is preventable by the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) live attenuated vaccine. The patient's presentation with parotitis followed by orchitis aligns with mumps infection.  
  - **Relevance:** High. Fits both the initial and subsequent symptoms.  
- **Option 2: Dilation of the pampiniform plexus**  
  - **Analysis:** Refers to varicocele, typically presenting as a painless, "bag of worms" feeling in the scrotum, usually more common on the left side, and unrelated to acute infection or systemic symptoms.  
  - **Relevance:** Low. Does not align with the acute presentation and associated facial symptoms.  
- **Option 3: Original presentation in the form of a painless chancre**  
  - **Analysis:** Describes primary syphilis, which presents with a painless ulcer (chancre) at the site of infection, not with orchitis and parotitis.  
  - **Relevance:** Low. Does not match the patient's symptoms.  
- **Option 4: Cause buboes in the inguinal lymph nodes**  
  - **Analysis:** Associated with bubonic plague or certain sexually transmitted infections like chancroid, which present with painful lymphadenopathy. The patient's symptoms do not include inguinal buboes.  
  - **Relevance:** Low. Inconsistent with the clinical presentation.  
- **Option 5: Is a common cause of septic arthritis in this patient’s age group**  
  - **Analysis:** Septic arthritis is typically caused by bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus or Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The patient's symptoms are more consistent with viral orchitis rather than septic arthritis.  
  - **Relevance:** Low. Does not correspond with the current symptomatology.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1 (Preventable by a live attenuated vaccine)（可通过活减毒疫苗预防）**

Qwen is reasoning the answer...

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 1 (Preventable by a live attenuated vaccine)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 22-year-old Nepalese man presents with acute right testicular swelling and pain.  
- Key symptoms include a history of fever 10 days prior and right-sided facial swelling (suggestive of parotitis).  
- No dysuria or urethral discharge; monogamous sexual history.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline and Symptom Interrelationship**:  
  - The patient describes a 10-day history of fever and unilateral facial swelling (right side), followed by testicular symptoms. This suggests a systemic infectious process.  
  - Parotitis (swelling of the parotid gland) is a hallmark of mumps. Testicular involvement (orchitis) often occurs 4–7 days after parotitis in post-pubertal males.  
  - The absence of urethral discharge or dysuria makes sexually transmitted infections (e.g., chlamydia, gonorrhea) less likely.  

- **Decisive Features**:  
  - **Facial swelling (parotitis)** and **testicular inflammation** occurring in temporal sequence strongly suggest mumps orchitis.  
  - The patient’s recent arrival from Nepal, where mumps vaccination rates may be lower, increases the likelihood of mumps if unvaccinated.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (Preventable by a live attenuated vaccine)**:  
  - Mumps is caused by the mumps virus and is preventable via the **MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) live attenuated vaccine**. This aligns with the clinical presentation.  

- **Option 2 (Dilation of the pampiniform plexus)**:  
  - Varicocele (dilation of the pampiniform plexus) typically presents as a painless scrotal mass and is unrelated to systemic symptoms like parotitis or fever.  

- **Option 3 (Painless chancre as original presentation)**:  
  - Syphilis (primary stage) presents with a painless chancre. However, buboes (inguinal lymphadenopathy) and systemic symptoms like parotitis are not features of syphilis.  

- **Option 4 (Cause buboes in inguinal lymph nodes)**:  
  - Buboes are associated with lymphogranuloma venereum, chancroid, or plague. While mumps can cause lymphadenopathy, buboes are not characteristic.  

- **Option 5 (Common cause of septic arthritis in this age group)**:  
  - Septic arthritis is rare in the testis and typically involves joints like the knee. This is inconsistent with the clinical scenario.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1 (Preventable by a live attenuated vaccine)(可通过减毒活疫苗预防)**

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 1 (Preventable by a live attenuated vaccine)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Profile**: 22-year-old man from Nepal, recently moved to the US, monogamous.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Right testicular swelling and pain (orchitis).  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations**:  
  - Recent (10 days prior) febrile illness with unilateral facial swelling and pain (parotitis).  
  - Absence of urethral discharge, dysuria, or genital ulcers.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline and Symptom Interrelationships**:  
  - Parotitis (facial swelling and fever) precedes orchitis by ~10 days. This progression aligns with **mumps**, where orchitis typically follows parotitis by 5–10 days.  
  - Absence of urethritis or genital ulcers argues against sexually transmitted infections (STIs) like gonorrhea, chlamydia, or syphilis.  
- **Supportive Features**:  
  - Orchitis in post-pubertal males is a classic complication of mumps (15–30% of cases).  
  - Parotitis is pathognomonic for mumps.  
- **Contradictory Features**:  
  - No urethral discharge or dysuria makes STIs less likely.  
  - Painless chancre (syphilis) or inguinal buboes (LGV, plague) absent.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Option 1 (Preventable by a live attenuated vaccine)**:  
   - Mumps is preventable by the MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine, a live attenuated vaccine. Endemic regions with lower vaccination rates (e.g., Nepal) have higher mumps incidence. Strongly aligns with the clinical timeline and findings.  
2. **Option 2 (Dilation of the pampiniform plexus)**:  
   - Refers to varicocele, a chronic, painless condition unrelated to acute orchitis or parotitis. Does not fit.  
3. **Option 3 (Original presentation as a painless chancre)**:  
   - Describes primary syphilis. The patient lacks genital ulcers or STI risk factors. Inconsistent.  
4. **Option 4 (Cause buboes in the inguinal lymph nodes)**:  
   - Suggests lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) or plague, neither of which explain parotitis or orchitis. Irrelevant.  
5. **Option 5 (Common cause of septic arthritis)**:  
   - Septic arthritis in young adults is typically caused by gonorrhea or Staphylococcus aureus. No joint symptoms here. Incorrect.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1 (Preventable by a live attenuated vaccine)(可通过减毒活疫苗预防)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Parotitis followed by orchitis is classic for mumps.  
  - Mumps is preventable by the MMR vaccine, a live attenuated vaccine.  
  - The patient’s origin from Nepal (potential gaps in vaccination coverage) supports this diagnosis.
