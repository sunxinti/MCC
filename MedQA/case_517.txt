Case_description: 
A male newborn is evaluated 24 hours after delivery for high-pitched crying, poor feeding, rhinorrhea, and low-grade fever. He was born at 40 weeks' gestation at 2514 g (5.54 lb) to a 28-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, by an uncomplicated cesarean section. Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The mother did not receive prenatal care. The infant's temperature is 38.0°C (100.4°F), pulse is 170/min, and blood pressure is 71/39 mm Hg. Examination shows hyperreflexia, tremors, and an excessive startle response. These symptoms are mostly like due to maternal use of which of the following?

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** Male newborn, 24 hours old, born at 40 weeks' gestation via uncomplicated cesarean section. Birth weight: 2514 g. Apgar scores: 8 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes.  
- **Chief Complaints:** High-pitched crying, poor feeding, rhinorrhea, low-grade fever.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - **Vital Signs:** Temperature 38.0°C (100.4°F), pulse 170/min (tachycardia), blood pressure 71/39 mm Hg.  
  - **Physical Examination:** Hyperreflexia, tremors, excessive startle response.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline:** Symptoms presented within the first 24 hours of life, suggesting neonatal adaptation issues or withdrawal phenomena.  
- **Characteristics:**  
  - **Autonomic Instability:** Tachycardia and low blood pressure indicate autonomic nervous system involvement.  
  - **Central Nervous System Signs:** Hyperreflexia, tremors, and excessive startle response are indicative of neurological hyperexcitability.  
  - **Behavioral Signs:** High-pitched crying and poor feeding are common in neonatal distress.  
- **Interrelationships:** The combination of autonomic instability and central nervous system hyperexcitability strongly suggests neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), which results from in utero exposure to certain substances.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: GABAA receptor agonist**  
  - **Examples:** Benzodiazepines.  
  - **Relevance:** Can cause NAS with symptoms like irritability, tremors, and feeding difficulties. However, opioid withdrawal is more commonly associated with the described severity of symptoms.  
- **Option 2: Mu receptor agonist**  
  - **Examples:** Opioids (e.g., heroin, methadone).  
  - **Relevance:** Strongly associated with NAS, presenting with high-pitched crying, hyperreflexia, tremors, autonomic instability (tachycardia, sweating, fever), and poor feeding. The clinical presentation aligns closely with opioid withdrawal.  
- **Option 3: Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist**  
  - **Examples:** Not typically associated with NAS. Withdrawal symptoms differ and are less severe in the neonatal period.  
- **Option 4: Monoamine reuptake antagonist**  
  - **Examples:** Certain antidepressants like SSRIs.  
  - **Relevance:** May cause neonatal adaptation syndrome but generally presents with less severe symptoms compared to opioid withdrawal.  
- **Option 5: Thyroperoxidase inhibitor**  
  - **Examples:** Antithyroid medications.  
  - **Relevance:** Not relevant to the presented symptoms and typically does not cause NAS.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Mu receptor agonist)(阿片受体激动剂)**

Qwen is reasoning the answer...

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 2 (Mu receptor agonist)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A male newborn, 24 hours post-delivery via cesarean, presents with high-pitched crying, poor feeding, rhinorrhea, low-grade fever (38.0°C), tachycardia (170/min), and hypotension (71/39 mm Hg). Physical exam reveals hyperreflexia, tremors, and an excessive startle response.  
- **Decisive symptoms**: Hyperreflexia, tremors, excessive startle response, and irritability (high-pitched cry) are hallmark features of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), suggesting in-utero drug exposure.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Symptom onset**: Symptoms appear within 24 hours of birth, consistent with abrupt withdrawal from a short-acting drug (e.g., opioids).  
- **Neurological signs**: Hyperreflexia and tremors indicate central nervous system hyperirritability. The excessive startle response is a key feature of opioid withdrawal, as it reflects increased sensitivity to sensory stimuli.  
- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever and rhinorrhea could suggest infection, but the constellation of neurological and autonomic symptoms (tachycardia, hypotension) align more with drug withdrawal than infection.  
- **Maternal history**: Lack of prenatal care increases the likelihood of undiagnosed drug use.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (GABAA receptor agonist)**: Benzodiazepines or barbiturates act as GABAA agonists. Neonatal withdrawal from these typically causes seizures, hypotonia, and respiratory depression, not hyperreflexia or excessive startle. Less likely.  
- **Option 2 (Mu receptor agonist)**: Opioids (e.g., morphine, oxycodone) are mu receptor agonists. NAS due to opioids classically presents with excessive crying, tremors, hyperreflexia, and exaggerated startle responses. The timing and symptoms align perfectly. Most likely.  
- **Option 3 (Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist)**: Maternal smoking (nicotine) can cause prematurity or respiratory distress but is less associated with severe neurological hyperirritability. Unlikely.  
- **Option 4 (Monoamine reuptake antagonist)**: SSRIs/SNRIs can cause NAS with irritability and tremors, but excessive startle and hyperreflexia are more characteristic of opioids. Less specific.  
- **Option 5 (Thyroperoxidase inhibitor)**: Antithyroid drugs (e.g., methimazole) cause neonatal thyroid dysfunction, presenting with lethargy or hypothermia, not hyperirritability. Excluded.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Mu receptor agonist)(μ受体激动剂)**  

**Key evidence supporting this choice**:  
- The infant’s hyperreflexia, tremors, excessive startle, and irritability are classic features of neonatal opioid withdrawal.  
- Mu receptor agonists (opioids) have a short half-life, leading to abrupt withdrawal symptoms within 24 hours of birth.  
- Maternal lack of prenatal care increases the risk of undiagnosed opioid use, a common cause of NAS.

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 2 (Mu receptor agonist)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: Male newborn, 24 hours old, born at 40 weeks (2514 g) via uncomplicated cesarean section.  
- **Key Symptoms**:  
  - High-pitched crying, poor feeding, rhinorrhea, low-grade fever (38.0°C).  
  - Tachycardia (170/min), hyperreflexia, tremors, excessive startle response.  
- **Maternal History**: No prenatal care (increasing risk of undetected substance use).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Neurological Signs**: Hyperreflexia, tremors, and startle response suggest central nervous system (CNS) hyperexcitability.  
- **Autonomic Symptoms**: Tachycardia, fever, and rhinorrhea indicate autonomic dysregulation.  
- **Timeline**: Symptoms appearing at 24 hours align with neonatal withdrawal syndromes (e.g., opioid withdrawal typically manifests within 24–72 hours).  
- **Key Differentiators**: Rhinorrhea and fever are hallmark features of opioid withdrawal, while SSRI withdrawal lacks these.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **GABAA Receptor Agonist (e.g., benzodiazepines)**: Withdrawal causes irritability, hypertonia, and seizures but rarely rhinorrhea or fever. Less consistent.  
2. **Mu Receptor Agonist (e.g., opioids)**: Classic for neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS): high-pitched crying, tremors, autonomic dysfunction (fever, rhinorrhea). Matches all symptoms.  
3. **Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Agonist (e.g., nicotine)**: Associated with irritability and feeding issues but lacks fever, hyperreflexia, or autonomic instability. Unlikely.  
4. **Monoamine Reuptake Antagonist (e.g., SSRIs)**: Causes jitteriness, hyperreflexia, and irritability but typically without fever or rhinorrhea. Less likely.  
5. **Thyroperoxidase Inhibitor (e.g., methimazole)**: Neonatal hypothyroidism presents with lethargy, hypotonia, and jaundice—not seen here. Does not fit.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Mu receptor agonist)(μ受体激动剂)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Symptom triad of high-pitched crying, autonomic instability (fever, rhinorrhea), and neurologic hyperexcitability (tremors, hyperreflexia) is pathognomonic for opioid withdrawal.  
  - Maternal lack of prenatal care raises suspicion for undisclosed opioid use.  
  - Timeline (24 hours post-birth) aligns with NAS onset.
