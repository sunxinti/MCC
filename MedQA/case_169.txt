**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** An 8-year-old girl.  
- **Chief Complaint:** 2-day history of hematuria (blood in urine).  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - History of sore throat two weeks prior, which resolved without treatment.  
  - Physical examination reveals 1+ pitting edema of the lower legs and ankles.  
  - Urinalysis shows numerous red blood cells (RBCs) and 3+ proteinuria.  
  - Elevated antistreptolysin O (ASO) titer.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
The patient presents with hematuria and proteinuria, accompanied by lower limb edema, which are indicative of glomerular disease affecting the kidneys' filtering units. The history of a recent sore throat, especially in a child, raises suspicion for a post-infectious etiology, most commonly post-streptococcal infection. The elevated ASO titer corroborates a recent group A Streptococcus (GAS) infection. The timeline—symptoms appearing approximately two weeks after the initial infection—is consistent with the typical presentation of post-infectious glomerulonephritis (PIGN). PIGN is characterized by immune complex deposition in the glomeruli, leading to inflammation and the clinical manifestations observed.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Antigen-specific IgE binding to mast cells**  
  This mechanism is primarily associated with allergic reactions and immediate hypersensitivity (Type I), which do not explain the glomerular involvement and the timeline of symptoms in this case.

- **Option 2: Tissue-specific antibodies**  
  These are typically involved in autoimmune diseases where antibodies target specific tissues, such as Goodpasture syndrome targeting the kidneys and lungs. However, the patient's history strongly suggests a post-infectious etiology rather than an autoimmune process.

- **Option 3: Presensitized CD4+ helper T-cells**  
  While T-cells play a role in various immune responses, the primary mechanism in post-infectious glomerulonephritis involves immune complexes rather than T-cell mediated cytotoxicity.

- **Option 4: Antigen-antibody complexes**  
  This aligns with the known pathophysiology of post-infectious glomerulonephritis, where immune complexes from the streptococcal infection deposit in the glomeruli, activating complement and causing inflammation and damage.

- **Option 5: Presensitized CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells**  
  These cells are mainly involved in directly killing infected or malignant cells. They are not primarily responsible for the immune complex-mediated damage seen in this patient's presentation.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Antigen-antibody complexes) (抗原-抗体复合物)**

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 8-year-old girl.  
- **Chief Complaint**: 2-day history of hematuria.  
- **Key Symptoms**:  
  - 1+ pitting edema of lower legs/ankles.  
  - Urinalysis: Numerous RBCs (hematuria) and 3+ proteinuria.  
  - Elevated antistreptolysin O (ASO) titer.  
- **Decisive Features**:  
  - Recent streptococcal infection (sore throat 2 weeks prior).  
  - Acute nephritic syndrome presentation (hematuria, proteinuria, edema).  
  - Elevated ASO titer supporting post-streptococcal etiology.  

---

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline**: Sore throat resolved 2 weeks ago, followed by renal symptoms, consistent with **post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN)**.  
- **Clinical Presentation**:  
  - **Hematuria**: Suggests glomerular injury.  
  - **Proteinuria (3+)**: Indicates glomerular damage with loss of permselectivity.  
  - **Edema**: Likely due to hypoalbuminemia from proteinuria and renal sodium retention.  
  - **Elevated ASO titer**: Confirms recent streptococcal infection, a hallmark of PSGN.  
- **Mechanism**: The delayed onset (1–2 weeks post-infection) and immune complex deposition in glomeruli are classic for PSGN.  

---

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1. Antigen-specific IgE binding to mast cells (Type I hypersensitivity)**:  
  - Unlikely. IgE-mediated reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, urticaria) do not explain nephritic syndrome or immune complex deposition.  

- **Option 2. Tissue-specific antibodies (Type II hypersensitivity)**:  
  - Possible in conditions like Goodpasture’s syndrome, but PSGN is primarily **Type III** (immune complex-mediated), not anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies.  

- **Option 3. Presensitized CD4+ helper T-cells (Type IV hypersensitivity)**:  
  - Cell-mediated immunity (e.g., tubulointerstitial nephritis) is not the primary mechanism here.  

- **Option 4. Antigen-antibody complexes (Type III hypersensitivity)**:  
  - **Most consistent**. PSGN results from deposition of circulating immune complexes (streptococcal antigens + antibodies) in glomeruli, triggering complement activation and inflammation. The timing (2 weeks post-infection) aligns with immune complex formation.  

- **Option 5. Presensitized CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells (Type IV hypersensitivity)**:  
  - Direct cytotoxic T-cell attack (e.g., viral nephritis) is unrelated to PSGN’s immune complex mechanism.  

---

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Antigen-antibody complexes)(抗原抗体复合物)**  

**Key Evidence Supporting the Choice**:  
- The patient’s history of recent streptococcal infection (sore throat) and elevated ASO titer strongly implicate post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.  
- The clinical features (acute nephritic syndrome: hematuria, proteinuria, edema) and delayed onset are classic for immune complex-mediated glomerular injury (Type III hypersensitivity).  
- Antigen-antibody complexes (e.g., streptococcal M protein + IgG) deposit in the glomeruli, activating the complement system and causing inflammation, which explains the observed pathology.

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 8-year-old girl.  
- **Chief Complaint**: 2-day history of hematuria.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations**:  
  - Recent sore throat (2 weeks ago, resolved without treatment).  
  - **1+ pitting edema** in lower legs/ankles.  
  - Urinalysis: **numerous RBCs** (hematuria) and **3+ proteinuria**.  
  - Elevated **antistreptolysin O (ASO) titer**.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline**: Sore throat (2 weeks prior) → hematuria/proteinuria/edema (current).  
- **Critical Findings**:  
  - **ASO titer elevation** indicates recent streptococcal infection (e.g., Group A *Streptococcus*).  
  - **Hematuria + proteinuria + edema** suggest **glomerular injury**, likely post-infectious glomerulonephritis.  
- **Interrelationships**: Streptococcal infection triggers an immune response leading to glomerular inflammation and renal dysfunction.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Antigen-specific IgE binding to mast cells (Type I hypersensitivity)**:  
   - Manifests as acute allergic reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, urticaria).  
   - **Not consistent** with glomerulonephritis or delayed post-infectious symptoms.  

2. **Tissue-specific antibodies (Type II hypersensitivity)**:  
   - Involves antibodies targeting specific tissues (e.g., Goodpasture syndrome).  
   - No evidence of anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies here.  

3. **Presensitized CD4+ helper T-cells (Type IV hypersensitivity)**:  
   - Mediates delayed hypersensitivity (e.g., contact dermatitis, TB granulomas).  
   - Does not explain acute glomerular injury post-streptococcal infection.  

4. **Antigen-antibody complexes (Type III hypersensitivity)**:  
   - Immune complexes deposit in tissues (e.g., glomeruli), activating complement and causing inflammation.  
   - **Classic mechanism of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN)**. Elevated ASO supports streptococcal antigen involvement.  

5. **Presensitized CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells**:  
   - Targets intracellular pathogens (e.g., viruses) or mediates graft rejection.  
   - Not linked to PSGN or immune complex-mediated injury.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Antigen-antibody complexes)(抗原抗体复合物)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - PSGN is a **Type III hypersensitivity reaction** triggered by streptococcal antigen-antibody complexes depositing in glomeruli.  
  - Elevated ASO confirms prior streptococcal infection.  
  - Hematuria, proteinuria, and edema align with immune complex-mediated glomerular damage.
