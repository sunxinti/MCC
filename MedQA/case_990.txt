Case_description: 
A 3-week-old newborn is brought to the physician by his parents because of poor feeding, irritability, and frequent vomiting over the past week. The vomitus is greenish in color and smells strange. His parents have tried to feed him every 4 hours, but the patient often spits up or refuses to eat. The patient was born at term and had his first bowel movement at 50 hours of life. He has since had one bowel movement daily. He is at the 50th percentile for length, 10th percentile for weight, and 40th percentile for head circumference. He does not appear to be in acute distress. His temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse is 140/min, respirations are 40/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows that the patient has small, low-set ears, a broad and flat nasal bridge, and a large space between the first and second toes bilaterally. The abdomen is distended. When the finger is removed following a rectal exam, there is an explosive release of stool from the patient's rectum. An x-ray of the abdomen shows a section of dilated colon followed by a segment of colon without stool or air. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?
Options: 
1. CT scan of the abdomen
2. Transabdominal ultrasonography
3. Barium enema
4. Anorectal manometry
5. Rectal suction biopsy
Correct Answer: Rectal suction biopsy

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** A 3-week-old term newborn male.
- **Chief Complaint:** Poor feeding, irritability, and frequent vomiting over the past week.
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**
  - **Vomiting:** Greenish vomitus with a strange smell, suggestive of bilious vomiting.
  - **Feeding Issues:** Spitting up or refusing to eat despite frequent attempts.
  - **Growth Metrics:** Weight at the 10th percentile, indicating possible feeding or absorption issues.
  - **Physical Examination:**
    - Dysmorphic features: Small, low-set ears; broad and flat nasal bridge; large space between the first and second toes bilaterally.
    - Abdominal distension.
    - Explosive stool release upon removal of a finger after a rectal exam.
  - **Imaging:** Abdominal x-ray showing a section of dilated colon followed by a segment of colon without stool or air, indicating a transition zone.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Bilious Vomiting and Abdominal Distension:** Suggestive of intestinal obstruction.
- **Explosive Stool Release:** Highly indicative of Hirschsprung disease, where there is an obstruction due to the absence of ganglion cells, leading to stool buildup.
- **Dysmorphic Features:** May suggest an associated genetic syndrome, such as Down syndrome, which is commonly associated with Hirschsprung disease.
- **Abdominal X-ray Findings:** The transition zone between dilated and narrow segments of the colon is characteristic of Hirschsprung disease.
- **Timeline:** Onset of symptoms in the first few weeks of life is consistent with Hirschsprung disease presenting after the neonatal period.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: CT scan of the abdomen**
  - **Likelihood:** Low. CT scans are not first-line for suspected Hirschsprung disease and involve radiation exposure.
- **Option 2: Transabdominal ultrasonography**
  - **Likelihood:** Low to moderate. Ultrasound may show bowel dilation but is not diagnostic for Hirschsprung disease.
- **Option 3: Barium enema**
  - **Likelihood:** Moderate. Can show the transition zone and suggest Hirschsprung disease but is not definitive.
- **Option 4: Anorectal manometry**
  - **Likelihood:** Moderate. Can detect absence of the rectoanal inhibitory reflex, supporting diagnosis but not definitive.
- **Option 5: Rectal suction biopsy**
  - **Likelihood:** High. Considered the gold standard for diagnosing Hirschsprung disease by demonstrating the absence of ganglion cells.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 5 (Rectal suction biopsy)(直肠吸引活检)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 5 (Rectal suction biopsy)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 3-week-old term newborn presents with poor feeding, irritability, and frequent vomiting for 1 week. The vomitus is greenish (suggesting bile) and malodorous.  
- The infant has dysmorphic features: small, low-set ears, broad flat nasal bridge, and widely spaced first and second toes.  
- Abdominal distension and explosive stool release after rectal examination are critical findings.  
- X-ray reveals a dilated colon segment followed by a transition zone with no stool or air, highly suggestive of intestinal obstruction.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Symptoms**:  
  - Green vomitus indicates obstruction beyond the duodenum (e.g., distal bowel obstruction).  
  - Delayed first bowel movement (50 hours post-birth) and persistent daily stools may reflect functional obstruction.  
  - Weight at the 10th percentile suggests poor caloric intake due to feeding difficulties.  
- **Physical Exam**:  
  - Dysmorphic features (e.g., low-set ears, wide toe spacing) may indicate an underlying genetic syndrome (e.g., Hirschsprung’s-associated syndromes like Mowat-Wilson).  
  - Explosive stool release after rectal exam is a classic sign of Hirschsprung’s disease (rectal impaction followed by unopposed relaxation of the anal sphincter).  
- **Imaging**:  
  - The X-ray transition zone between dilated proximal colon and a collapsed distal segment strongly suggests Hirschsprung’s disease (aganglionic segment).  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (CT scan)**: Not first-line in neonates due to radiation exposure. CT may show bowel dilation but cannot confirm ganglion cell absence.  
- **Option 2 (Transabdominal ultrasound)**: May identify bowel dilation or a transition zone but lacks specificity for Hirschsprung’s.  
- **Option 3 (Barium enema)**: Demonstrates the transition zone between dilated and collapsed bowel segments, confirming the anatomical defect. It is a critical diagnostic tool but does not confirm the absence of ganglion cells.  
- **Option 4 (Anorectal manometry)**: Evaluates rectoanal inhibitory reflex, which is absent in Hirschsprung’s. Useful but not definitive.  
- **Option 5 (Rectal suction biopsy)**: The gold standard for diagnosing Hirschsprung’s. Absence of ganglion cells in the myenteric plexus confirms the diagnosis.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The explosive stool release after rectal exam, delayed meconium passage, and X-ray findings strongly implicate Hirschsprung’s disease. While barium enema confirms the anatomical transition zone, the definitive diagnosis requires histopathological confirmation via rectal biopsy.  

**My final selection is: Option 5 (Rectal suction biopsy)(直肠吸引活检)**

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 5 (Rectal suction biopsy)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 3-week-old term newborn with poor feeding, irritability, frequent **bilious (greenish) vomiting**, and abdominal distension.  
- **Key findings**: Delayed first bowel movement (50 hours), explosive stool release post-rectal exam, abdominal x-ray showing **dilated proximal colon** with a distal "transition zone" lacking stool/air.  
- **Dysmorphic features**: Low-set ears, broad nasal bridge, wide toe spacing (suggestive of syndromic associations, e.g., Down syndrome).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Bilious vomiting** and **abdominal distension** indicate intestinal obstruction.  
- **Delayed meconium passage** (>48 hours) and **explosive stool** after rectal stimulation are classic for **Hirschsprung’s disease** (aganglionic megacolon).  
- **X-ray findings** (dilated proximal colon with distal narrowing) align with a **transition zone**, pathognomonic for Hirschsprung’s.  
- Dysmorphic features may suggest syndromic associations (e.g., trisomy 21), which increase Hirschsprung’s risk.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **CT abdomen**: Unnecessary radiation exposure in neonates; less specific for Hirschsprung’s.  
2. **Transabdominal US**: Rules out pyloric stenosis but irrelevant for bilious vomiting.  
3. **Barium enema**: May visualize a transition zone but is unreliable in neonates <1 month due to incomplete colonic maturation.  
4. **Anorectal manometry**: Tests for absent rectoanal inhibitory reflex (RAIR) in Hirschsprung’s, but technically challenging in infants and less sensitive than biopsy.  
5. **Rectal suction biopsy**: **Gold standard** for Hirschsprung’s; detects absence of ganglion cells in the submucosa.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 5 (Rectal suction biopsy)(直肠吸引活检)**  
- **Key evidence**:  
  - Explosive stool post-rectal exam and transition zone on x-ray strongly suggest Hirschsprung’s.  
  - Rectal biopsy is definitive for diagnosing aganglionosis, required to confirm the diagnosis before surgical intervention.  
  - Other modalities (e.g., barium enema, manometry) are supportive but lack diagnostic certainty in neonates.
