Case_description: 
A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician for sleeping problems and the inability to concentrate for 3 months. She says she is worried because she and her husband have been trying to conceive for more than a year with no success. Conception by in vitro fertilization was attempted once 3 months ago but was unsuccessful. Analysis of her husband's semen has shown normal sperm counts and morphology. She has a 6-year-old daughter who was born at term after an uncomplicated pregnancy. She has no history of severe illness and tries to stay healthy by going to the gym an hour per day. Her menses occur at regular 28-day intervals and last 5 to 6 days; her last menstrual period started 2 days ago. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's inability to conceive?
Options: 
1. Pelvic inflammatory disease
2. Asherman's syndrome
3. Diminished ovarian reserve
4. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
5. Premature ovarian failure
Correct Answer: Diminished ovarian reserve

GPT's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 3 (Diminished ovarian reserve)

GPT's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** 35-year-old woman with a 6-year-old daughter.
- **Chief Complaint:** Sleeping problems and inability to concentrate for 3 months.
- **Clinical Manifestations:**
  - Infertility: Trying to conceive for over a year without success.
  - Previous IVF attempt 3 months ago was unsuccessful.
  - Regular menstrual cycles: 28-day intervals, lasting 5-6 days.
  - Physical examination shows no abnormalities.
  - Husband has normal semen parameters.
  - No history of severe illness; maintains regular exercise.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Infertility Duration:** Primary infertility is typically diagnosed after one year of unprotected intercourse without conception, which aligns with the patient's history.
- **Menstrual Regularity:** Regular 28-day cycles with normal duration suggest normal ovulatory function.
- **Previous Pregnancy:** Successful term pregnancy indicates prior normal reproductive function.
- **Age Factor:** At 35, there is a natural decline in ovarian reserve, but it's not yet in the range typically associated with diminished fertility.
- **Psychological Symptoms:** Sleeping problems and concentration issues may be related to stress from infertility but are not directly indicative of a specific reproductive disorder.
- **IVF Failure:** Previous unsuccessful IVF attempt may suggest underlying issues with ovarian response or egg quality.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID):**  
   - **Likelihood:** Low. Typically presents with pain, history of sexually transmitted infections, or pelvic symptoms, none of which are present.
   
2. **Asherman's Syndrome:**  
   - **Likelihood:** Low. Usually results from intrauterine surgery leading to scarring, with a history of procedures like D&C, which is absent.
   
3. **Diminished Ovarian Reserve:**  
   - **Likelihood:** High. At age 35, ovarian reserve begins to decline naturally. The unsuccessful IVF attempt may indicate reduced ovarian response, despite regular menstrual cycles and prior successful conception.
   
4. **Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism:**  
   - **Likelihood:** Low. Typically associated with irregular or absent menstrual cycles and other signs of estrogen deficiency, which the patient does not exhibit.
   
5. **Premature Ovarian Failure:**  
   - **Likelihood:** Low. Generally occurs before age 40 and is characterized by irregular or absent menstruation and menopausal symptoms, which are not present in this patient.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Diminished ovarian reserve)(卵巢储备减少)**

Qwen is reasoning the answer...

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 3 (Diminished ovarian reserve)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 35-year-old woman presents with insomnia, concentration difficulties, and infertility for over a year. She had a successful prior pregnancy (a 6-year-old daughter) but failed IVF 3 months ago. Her husband’s semen analysis is normal.  
- Key symptoms: Regular 28-day menstrual cycles, no physical abnormalities, and inability to conceive despite normal male factor fertility.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline and Symptoms**: The patient’s infertility began after her first uncomplicated pregnancy, suggesting a new issue. The failed IVF attempt points to potential oocyte-related problems.  
- **Normal menstrual cycles**: Regular cycles (28-day intervals, 5–6 days) indicate ovulatory function, ruling out anovulation.  
- **Age**: At 35, diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) is increasingly common, which can lead to infertility even with regular cycles.  
- **Failed IVF**: DOR may result in poor oocyte quality or quantity, leading to IVF failure.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **1. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)**: Unlikely, as prior successful pregnancy implies patent fallopian tubes. No symptoms (e.g., pain, discharge) or physical findings suggest PID.  
- **2. Asherman’s syndrome**: Uterine scarring from procedures like dilation and curettage (D&C) would cause amenorrhea or hypomenorrhea, but her cycles are regular and normal. No history of uterine procedures is mentioned.  
- **3. Diminished ovarian reserve (DOR)**: Strongly supported. Age 35, failed IVF, and ongoing infertility despite normal cycles align with DOR. Regular ovulation can persist even with reduced ovarian reserve, which impairs conception and IVF success.  
- **4. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH)**: Requires anovulation or irregular cycles due to hypothalamic/pituitary dysfunction. Her regular cycles suggest normal gonadotropin stimulation, making HH unlikely.  
- **5. Premature ovarian failure (POF)**: Typically presents with amenorrhea and elevated FSH. Regular menses rule out POF, as ovarian failure disrupts cyclicity.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Diminished ovarian reserve)(卵巢储备功能减退)**

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 3 (Diminished ovarian reserve)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Profile**: 35-year-old woman with a 1-year history of infertility, regular menses (28-day cycles), and one unsuccessful IVF attempt 3 months ago. Husband has normal semen analysis.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Inability to conceive, accompanied by insomnia and poor concentration for 3 months.  
- **Key Features**: Regular menstrual cycles, uncomplicated prior pregnancy, no physical abnormalities, normal pelvic exam.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline**: Infertility for >1 year; regular menses and recent IVF failure suggest ovarian or tubal/uterine factors.  
- **Supporting/Opposing Features**:  
  - **Regular menses** opposes diagnoses causing amenorrhea (e.g., **Premature ovarian failure**, **Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism**).  
  - **No history of uterine procedures or infection** reduces likelihood of **Asherman’s syndrome** (requires intrauterine scarring) or **Pelvic inflammatory disease** (requires prior infection).  
  - **Age (35)** and IVF failure align with **Diminished ovarian reserve (DOR)**, a common age-related decline in oocyte quantity/quality.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)**: Unlikely. No history of pelvic pain, dyspareunia, or abnormal discharge; normal exam.  
2. **Asherman’s syndrome**: Unlikely. Regular menses indicate intact endometrial shedding; no history of uterine trauma or postpartum/post-abortion complications.  
3. **Diminished ovarian reserve (DOR)**: Likely. Age ≥35 is a key risk factor. IVF failure may reflect poor ovarian response. Regular cycles do not exclude DOR, as ovarian reserve declines before overt cycle irregularities.  
4. **Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism**: Unlikely. Regular menses indicate normal hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis function.  
5. **Premature ovarian failure (POF)**: Unlikely. POF typically causes amenorrhea or irregular cycles, not regular menses.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Diminished ovarian reserve)(卵巢储备功能减退)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Age 35, a critical risk factor for DOR.  
  - IVF failure despite normal semen analysis.  
  - Regular menses exclude structural/hormonal pathologies (e.g., Asherman’s, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism).  
  - DOR often presents with preserved cycle regularity but reduced fertility due to diminished oocyte quality/quantity.
