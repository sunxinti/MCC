GPT's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** 35-year-old female with no significant past medical history.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Found unconscious and brought to the emergency department.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - **Blood Glucose Level:** 35 mg/dL (severe hypoglycemia).  
  - **Hgb A1c:** 5.1% (indicates no chronic hyperglycemia; suggests acute hypoglycemic event).  
  - **C-peptide Level:** Decreased (suggests exogenous insulin administration).  
  - **Response to Treatment:** Returned to baseline after glucose replacement.  
  - **Psychosocial Factors:** Undergoing a difficult divorce, which may indicate psychological stress.  
  - **Family History:** Diabetes in mother, though the patient herself has not been diagnosed with diabetes.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Hypoglycemia:** The patient's blood glucose level of 35 mg/dL is critically low and explains the unconscious state.  
- **Hgb A1c:** A level of 5.1% suggests that the patient does not have chronic hyperglycemia, making endogenous hyperinsulinemic causes like insulinoma less likely.  
- **C-peptide Level:** A decreased C-peptide indicates that endogenous insulin production is low, which points towards exogenous insulin administration rather than endogenous causes.  
- **Acute Presentation:** The sudden onset of hypoglycemia with no prior history suggests an acute event rather than a chronic condition.  
- **Psychosocial Stress:** The ongoing difficult divorce may contribute to psychological disorders that could manifest physically.  
- **Exclusion of Other Symptoms:** No signs or symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism, somatization, or reactive hypoglycemia are present.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Insulinoma:**  
   - **Likelihood:** Low. Insulinomas typically present with endogenous hyperinsulinemia, resulting in elevated insulin and C-peptide levels. This patient's C-peptide is decreased, which does not support insulinoma.  
2. **Factitious Disorder:**  
   - **Likelihood:** High. Factitious hypoglycemia involves self-administration of insulin or insulin secretagogues, leading to low blood glucose and low C-peptide levels, as seen in this patient. The acute presentation without a history of diabetes and the psychosocial stressor further support this diagnosis.  
3. **Alimentary Hypoglycemia:**  
   - **Likelihood:** Low. This condition usually presents as reactive hypoglycemia following meals, which does not align with the acute unconsciousness without preceding meals.  
4. **Hypothyroidism:**  
   - **Likelihood:** Low. While hypothyroidism can affect metabolism, it is not directly associated with acute severe hypoglycemia. Additionally, there are no other clinical signs pointing towards hypothyroidism.  
5. **Somatization Disorder:**  
   - **Likelihood:** Low to Moderate. Although psychological stress is present, somatization typically involves multiple physical symptoms over time rather than an acute hypoglycemic episode with biochemical evidence.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Factitious disorder)(造假症)**

Qwen is reasoning the answer...

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 2 (Factitious disorder)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 35-year-old female presented unconscious with severe hypoglycemia (blood glucose 35 mg/dL), resolving after glucose replacement.  
- Key features:  
  - Normal HbA1c (5.1%) and decreased C-peptide.  
  - No prior medical history of diabetes or hypoglycemia.  
  - Family history of diabetes in her mother.  
  - Psychosocial stressor (ongoing divorce).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Hypoglycemia severity**: Unconsciousness indicates profound hypoglycemia, requiring immediate glucose replacement.  
- **Normal HbA1c**: Rules out chronic hyperglycemia (e.g., undiagnosed type 2 diabetes).  
- **Decreased C-peptide**: Suggests **absence of endogenous insulin secretion** during the episode. This is critical because hypoglycemia caused by endogenous insulin (e.g., insulinoma, alimentary hypoglycemia) would typically elevate C-peptide.  
- **Single episode**: No prior episodes, making chronic causes like insulinoma less likely unless recent onset.  
- **Psychosocial context**: Stress (divorce) may motivate intentional hypoglycemia induction (factitious disorder).  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **1. Insulinoma**:  
  - **Support**: Insulin-secreting tumor can cause fasting hypoglycemia.  
  - **Contradiction**: C-peptide would be **elevated** due to excessive endogenous insulin, conflicting with the case’s decreased C-peptide. Unlikely.  
- **2. Factitious disorder**:  
  - **Support**: Intentional insulin/sulfonylurea use would lower blood glucose and suppress C-peptide (since exogenous insulin lacks C-peptide). Psychosocial stress (divorce) may trigger such behavior.  
  - **Alignment**: Matches decreased C-peptide and single episode.  
- **3. Alimentary hypoglycemia**:  
  - **Support**: Postprandial hypoglycemia due to excessive insulin release after meals.  
  - **Contradiction**: C-peptide would be **elevated**, not decreased. Unlikely given the clinical data.  
- **4. Hypothyroidism**:  
  - **Support**: Rarely causes hypoglycemia (due to reduced gluconeogenesis).  
  - **Contradiction**: No thyroid-related symptoms (e.g., fatigue, weight gain). Unlikely.  
- **5. Somatization disorder**:  
  - **Support**: Psychological stress-induced symptoms.  
  - **Contradiction**: Hypoglycemia requires a metabolic cause; somatization lacks a physical basis. Unlikely.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Factitious disorder)(人为性疾病)**  

**Key Evidence**:  
- Decreased C-peptide indicates **no endogenous insulin secretion**, ruling out insulinoma and alimentary hypoglycemia.  
- Psychosocial stress (divorce) aligns with factitious behavior (e.g., intentional insulin/sulfonylurea ingestion).  
- Normal HbA1c and lack of prior episodes further support an acute, non-organic cause.

DeepSeek is reasoning the answer...

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 2 (Factitious disorder)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Basic Information**: 35-year-old female, no significant past medical history, family history of diabetes in mother, undergoing a stressful divorce.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Unconsciousness with severe hypoglycemia (blood glucose: 35 mg/dL).  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations**:  
  - Severe hypoglycemia with rapid resolution after glucose replacement.  
  - Normal Hgb A1c (5.1%), indicating no chronic hyperglycemia.  
  - Decreased C-peptide level.  
  - No prior hypoglycemic episodes.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Hypoglycemia Mechanism**: Low C-peptide indicates suppressed endogenous insulin production. This is inconsistent with insulinoma (where both insulin and C-peptide are elevated) but aligns with exogenous insulin administration.  
- **Hgb A1c**: Normal (5.1%) rules out chronic hyperglycemia or untreated diabetes. A single hypoglycemic episode would not significantly lower A1c, supporting acute exogenous insulin exposure.  
- **Psychosocial Context**: Stressful divorce raises suspicion for factitious disorder, where patients may self-administer insulin to gain attention or cope with distress.  
- **Timeline**: Acute onset without prior episodes suggests a non-chronic etiology (e.g., self-induced hypoglycemia rather than insulinoma).  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Insulinoma**  
  - **Contradicted by**: Low C-peptide (insulinoma causes elevated C-peptide). No history of recurrent hypoglycemia.  
- **Option 2: Factitious Disorder**  
  - **Supported by**: Low C-peptide (exogenous insulin use), normal A1c, acute stressor (divorce). Classic presentation of surreptitious insulin administration.  
- **Option 3: Alimentary Hypoglycemia**  
  - **Unlikely**: Typically postprandial, associated with prior gastric surgery (not reported here). Severe unconsciousness is atypical.  
- **Option 4: Hypothyroidism**  
  - **Irrelevant**: Hypothyroidism does not directly cause severe hypoglycemia. No clinical signs (e.g., fatigue, weight gain) noted.  
- **Option 5: Somatization Disorder**  
  - **Excluded**: Hypoglycemia is objectively confirmed, ruling out purely psychogenic symptoms.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Factitious disorder)(做作性障碍)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  1. **Low C-peptide** confirms exogenous insulin source.  
  2. **Normal Hgb A1c** excludes chronic glycemic dysregulation.  
  3. **Psychosocial stressor** (divorce) provides motive for self-harm.  
  4. **Absence of recurrent episodes** aligns with intentional, acute insulin administration.
