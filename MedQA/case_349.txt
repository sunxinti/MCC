Case_description: 
A 16-year-old patient presents to the physician’s office with an absence of menstruations. Her last period was 6 months ago. Since almost a year and a half ago, she intentionally restricted her diet at the expense of carbohydrates, exercised intensively, and lost 18.0 kg (39.7 lb). She had her menarche at the age of 12 and menstruated normally until last year. She is not sexually active. On physical examination, the vital signs include blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg, heart rate 55/min, respiratory rate 12/min, and temperature 35.9°C (96.6°F). Her weight is 55.0 kg (121.3 lb), and her height is 166 cm (5 ft 5 in). Physical examination reveals the good development of muscles and decreased adiposity. A bone scan shows decreased calcium mineral deposits. Which statement about this patient’s condition is correct?
Options: 
1. Hypertrophied muscles are the source of additional androgens which interfere with the patient’s menstrual cycle
2. This patient has insulin resistance
3. Decreased adiposity contributes to hypoestrogenemia in this patient
4. The patient is likely to have decreased blood estrogen concentration due to increased liver metabolism
5. The patient should be checked for hyperthyroidism because such extensive lipolysis is likely to result from thyroid hyperfunction
Correct Answer: Decreased adiposity contributes to hypoestrogenemia in this patient

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** 16-year-old female  
- **Chief Complaint:** Absence of menstruation (amenorrhea) for the past 6 months  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - Intentional dietary restriction, especially carbohydrates, and intensive exercise over 1.5 years  
  - Significant weight loss of 18.0 kg (39.7 lb)  
  - Last menstrual period was 6 months ago, with normal menstruation since menarche at age 12 until last year  
  - Physical signs include low blood pressure (100/60 mm Hg), bradycardia (55/min), low respiratory rate (12/min), hypothermia (35.9°C), good muscle development, decreased adiposity  
  - Bone scan reveals decreased calcium mineral deposits  
- **Decisive Symptoms and Signs:** Amenorrhea, significant weight loss, decreased adiposity, and decreased bone mineral density.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Menstrual Irregularities:** The patient's amenorrhea is likely secondary to energy deficit caused by excessive weight loss and intensive exercise, leading to hormonal imbalances.  
- **Weight Loss and Dietary Restrictions:** Significant weight loss and decreased adiposity suggest an energy-deficient state, which can disrupt the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, resulting in hypoestrogenemia.  
- **Vital Signs:** Low blood pressure, bradycardia, and hypothermia are consistent with a state of energy conservation often seen in conditions like amenorrhea associated with energy deficit.  
- **Bone Health:** Decreased calcium mineral deposits indicate reduced bone density, a consequence of chronic hypoestrogenemia.  
- **Interrelationships:** The combination of decreased adiposity and hypoestrogenemia explains the cessation of menstruation and reduced bone density, supporting a diagnosis related to energy deficiency rather than primary endocrine disorders.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Hypertrophied muscles and androgen interference:**  
   - **Likelihood:** Low  
   - **Reasoning:** The patient exhibits good muscle development but lacks signs of androgen excess typical in conditions like PCOS. Moreover, androgen interference is not the primary mechanism for her amenorrhea.  
2. **Insulin resistance:**  
   - **Likelihood:** Low  
   - **Reasoning:** Insulin resistance is more commonly associated with obesity and conditions like PCOS. This patient presents with decreased adiposity, making insulin resistance less likely.  
3. **Decreased adiposity contributes to hypoestrogenemia:**  
   - **Likelihood:** High  
   - **Reasoning:** Adipose tissue is essential for the production of estrogen through aromatization of androgens. Significant weight loss and decreased adiposity reduce estrogen levels, leading to amenorrhea and decreased bone density.  
4. **Decreased estrogen due to increased liver metabolism:**  
   - **Likelihood:** Low  
   - **Reasoning:** The primary cause of hypoestrogenemia in this patient is reduced production due to decreased adipose tissue, not increased liver metabolism of estrogen.  
5. **Hyperthyroidism-related lipolysis:**  
   - **Likelihood:** Low  
   - **Reasoning:** The patient's low body temperature contradicts hyperthyroidism, which typically presents with elevated metabolism and hyperthermia. Additionally, lipolysis from hyperthyroidism does not directly explain hypoestrogenemia and amenorrhea in this context.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Decreased adiposity contributes to hypoestrogenemia in this patient) (减少的脂肪量导致本患者雌激素不足)**

Qwen is reasoning the answer...

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 3 (Decreased adiposity contributes to hypoestrogenemia in this patient)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 16-year-old female with primary amenorrhea (no periods for 6 months).  
- History of intentional carbohydrate restriction, intensive exercise, and significant weight loss (18 kg over 18 months).  
- Menarche at age 12 with normal menses until 1 year ago.  
- Physical exam: low body weight (BMI ~20.7, borderline for her age), decreased adiposity, well-developed muscles, bradycardia (55/min), hypothermia (35.9°C), and decreased bone mineral density.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline**: Amenorrhea began after significant weight loss and caloric restriction, suggesting an energy-deficit state.  
- **Key Features**: Decreased adiposity, muscle hypertrophy, bradycardia, hypothermia, and low bone mineral density align with **relative energy deficiency in sports (RED-S)** or anorexia nervosa.  
- **Hypoestrogenism**: Low body fat impairs adipose-derived estrogen synthesis, leading to amenorrhea and bone loss.  
- **No evidence of hyperthyroidism**: Vital signs (e.g., bradycardia) and symptoms (e.g., cold intolerance) do not strongly suggest hyperthyroidism.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1**: Muscle hypertrophy causing excess androgens? Unlikely. Muscle-derived androgens are insufficient to suppress menstruation. The dominant issue is hypoestrogenism, not hyperandrogenism.  
- **Option 2**: Insulin resistance? Unlikely in an underweight patient. Insulin resistance typically occurs with obesity or insulin-resistant states (e.g., PCOS), which are not supported here.  
- **Option 3**: Decreased adiposity causing hypoestrogenemia? **Highly likely**. Adipose tissue is a key source of estrogen via aromatase. Low body fat reduces estrogen production, leading to amenorrhea and bone loss.  
- **Option 4**: Decreased estrogen due to increased liver metabolism? No evidence of liver dysfunction or medications affecting estrogen metabolism.  
- **Option 5**: Hyperthyroidism? Unlikely. While hyperthyroidism can cause weight loss and bone loss, the patient’s bradycardia and hypothermia are atypical for hyperthyroidism. Her symptoms better fit energy deficiency.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Decreased adiposity contributes to hypoestrogenemia in this patient)(减少的脂肪量导致患者雌激素减少)**  

**Key Evidence**:  
- The patient’s significant weight loss and low adiposity directly reduce adipose-derived estrogen, a critical source of circulating estrogen in females.  
- Amenorrhea and osteopenia (from the bone scan) are hallmark features of hypoestrogenism due to energy deficiency, as seen in RED-S or anorexia nervosa.  
- No clinical or laboratory findings support hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, or hyperthyroidism.

DeepSeek is reasoning the answer...

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 3 (Decreased adiposity contributes to hypoestrogenemia in this patient)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 16-year-old female with secondary amenorrhea (6 months), intentional weight loss (18 kg over 1.5 years via carbohydrate restriction and intense exercise).  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Hypothermia (35.9°C), bradycardia (55/min), hypotension (100/60 mmHg).  
  - Low body weight (55 kg, BMI ~20), decreased adiposity, well-developed muscles.  
  - Osteopenia (reduced bone calcium deposits).  
  - Normal menarche at 12, previously regular menses.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline**: Chronic caloric deficit, exercise, and rapid weight loss preceded amenorrhea.  
- **Energy Deficit**: Severe restriction of carbohydrates and excessive exercise disrupt hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis, suppressing GnRH → low FSH/LH → hypoestrogenemia.  
- **Hypoestrogenemia**: Explains amenorrhea, osteopenia, and potentially contributes to bradycardia/hypothermia.  
- **Contradicts Other Diagnoses**:  
  - No signs of hyperandrogenism (e.g., hirsutism) to support Option 1.  
  - Insulin resistance (Option 2) is unlikely in a lean, physically active patient.  
  - Hyperthyroidism (Option 5) would cause weight loss with increased appetite, tachycardia, and heat intolerance, not hypothermia/bradycardia.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1**: Muscle-derived androgens interfering with menses.  
  - Unsupported: Hypertrophied muscles do not produce significant androgens. Hypoestrogenemia, not hyperandrogenism, drives amenorrhea here.  
- **Option 2**: Insulin resistance.  
  - Unlikely: Insulin resistance correlates with obesity, PCOS, or acanthosis nigricans—none present. Weight loss and leanness oppose this.  
- **Option 3**: Decreased adiposity → hypoestrogenemia.  
  - **Strongly Supported**: Adipose tissue aromatizes androgens to estrogens. Critical fat mass (~17%) is required for menstrual cyclicity. Severe fat loss disrupts estrogen synthesis, causing amenorrhea and bone loss.  
- **Option 4**: Increased liver estrogen metabolism.  
  - Unlikely: No evidence of liver dysfunction or enzyme-inducing drugs. Hypoestrogenemia stems from reduced production, not accelerated clearance.  
- **Option 5**: Hyperthyroidism.  
  - Contradicted: Bradycardia, hypothermia, and intentional weight loss argue against hyperthyroidism.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Decreased adiposity contributes to hypoestrogenemia in this patient)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Severe adiposity loss from diet/exercise disrupts estrogen synthesis via reduced aromatase activity.  
  - Hypoestrogenemia explains amenorrhea, osteopenia, and aligns with hypothalamic suppression due to energy deficit.  
  - Clinical guidelines (e.g., Endocrine Society) identify low body fat as a key contributor to functional hypothalamic amenorrhea.
