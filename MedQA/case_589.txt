**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** A 36-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 2.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Sudden-onset, severe right flank pain occurring during an aerobics class.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - No history of trauma.  
  - History of recurrent ovarian cysts.  
  - Regular menstrual cycles with 28-day intervals.  
  - Temperature: 37.1°C (99.3°F).  
  - Abdominal examination reveals right lower quadrant tenderness with guarding.  
  - Pelvic ultrasound findings: Large simple cyst on the right ovary.  
  - Doppler ultrasound: Detectable flow in the right ovarian artery but no flow in the right ovarian vein.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Sudden-Onset Severe Flank Pain:** Suggestive of an acute abdominal or pelvic event, such as ovarian torsion, renal colic, or appendicitis.  
- **History of Recurrent Ovarian Cysts:** Increases the risk of ovarian torsion due to the increased size and weight of the ovary, which can predispose it to twist around its vascular pedicle.  
- **Ultrasound Findings:** A large ovarian cyst is a significant risk factor for ovarian torsion.  
- **Doppler Findings:** Presence of arterial flow with absent venous flow is characteristic of ovarian torsion. Arterial flow may remain detectable initially due to its higher pressure, but venous outflow is compromised, leading to congestion and pain.  
- **Physical Examination:** Right lower quadrant tenderness with guarding further supports an acute abdominal process involving the right adnexa.  
- **Absence of Trauma History:** Rules out traumatic rupture or hematoma, strengthening the suspicion of torsion.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Broad Ligament**  
  - **Function:** A wide fold of peritoneum that connects the sides of the uterus to the pelvic walls.  
  - **Relevance:** While structures within the broad ligament (e.g., fallopian tubes, blood vessels) can be involved in torsion, the broad ligament itself is not the primary structure implicated in vascular compromise specific to ovarian torsion.

- **Option 2: Round Ligament of the Uterus**  
  - **Function:** Extends from the uterus to the labia majora, maintaining the anteversion of the uterus.  
  - **Relevance:** Primarily involved in uterine positioning, not directly related to ovarian vascular structures or torsion.

- **Option 3: Ovarian Ligament**  
  - **Function:** Connects the ovary to the uterus.  
  - **Relevance:** While it anchors the ovary, torsion typically involves the suspensory structures that contain the blood vessels rather than the ovarian ligament itself.

- **Option 4: Cardinal Ligament**  
  - **Function:** Supports the lateral sides of the cervix and contains the uterine artery and vein.  
  - **Relevance:** More involved in uterine support and vasculature; less directly related to ovarian venous flow.

- **Option 5: Infundibulopelvic Ligament**  
  - **Function:** Also known as the suspensory ligament of the ovary, it contains the ovarian artery and vein.  
  - **Relevance:** Directly involved in ovarian torsion, as twisting occurs around this ligament, leading to compromised blood flow, particularly venous outflow initially.

Qwen is reasoning the answer...

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 5 (Infundibulopelvic ligament)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 36-year-old gravida 2, para 2 woman presents with sudden-onset severe right flank pain during aerobics, no trauma.  
- Key symptoms:  
  - Sudden, severe right flank pain.  
  - Right lower quadrant tenderness and guarding on abdominal exam.  
  - History of recurrent ovarian cysts.  
  - Ultrasound shows a large simple right ovarian cyst.  
  - Doppler shows detectable right ovarian artery flow but no flow in the right ovarian vein.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Sudden-onset pain during exercise**: Suggests a mechanical cause (e.g., torsion) triggered by physical activity.  
- **Large ovarian cyst**: Increases the risk of ovarian torsion due to a mobile, heavy mass.  
- **Abdominal tenderness and guarding**: Indicate peritoneal irritation, consistent with ischemia or rupture from torsion.  
- **Doppler findings**: The absence of flow in the ovarian vein but presence in the artery suggests partial or incomplete torsion. Complete torsion would typically occlude arterial flow first, leading to venous congestion. However, the persistence of arterial flow might indicate early-stage torsion or a partial twist. The lack of venous flow could result from venous compression within the twisted vascular pedicle.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **1. Broad ligament**: A peritoneal fold covering the ovaries and uterus. While it may be involved in cyst rupture or hemorrhage, it is not directly linked to vascular compromise from torsion.  
- **2. Round ligament**: Connects the uterus to the labia majora. Unrelated to ovarian torsion.  
- **3. Ovarian ligament (ligamentum propium)**: Connects the ovary to the uterine cornua. Does not contain major vascular structures; torsion would not involve this ligament.  
- **4. Cardinal ligament**: Supports the uterus; no role in ovarian vascular pedicle.  
- **5. Infundibulopelvic ligament (suspensory ligament of the ovary)**: Contains the ovarian vessels, nerves, and lymphatics. **This is the vascular pedicle of the ovary**. Torsion occurs when the ovary twists around this ligament, compressing the vessels. The Doppler findings (no venous flow) align with venous compression in this structure.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 5 (Infundibulopelvic ligament)(悬韧带)**  

**Key Evidence Supporting the Choice**:  
- The **infundibulopelvic ligament** is the anatomical structure containing the ovarian vessels. Torsion of the ovary around this ligament would compress the vessels, explaining the lack of venous flow on Doppler.  
- The clinical presentation (sudden pain, ovarian cyst, peritoneal signs) strongly points to ovarian torsion, which directly involves this ligament.  
- Other ligaments (e.g., ovarian, broad) lack vascular pedicle involvement, making them less likely.

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 5 (Infundibulopelvic ligament)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient:** 36-year-old woman, G2P2, history of recurrent ovarian cysts.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Sudden-onset, severe right flank pain during aerobics, no trauma.  
- **Key Findings:**  
  - Right lower quadrant tenderness with guarding.  
  - Pelvic ultrasound: Large simple right ovarian cyst.  
  - Doppler: Right ovarian artery flow present, right ovarian vein flow absent.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- Sudden flank pain during physical activity suggests acute vascular compromise (e.g., ovarian torsion).  
- Absent ovarian vein flow on Doppler indicates venous obstruction, typical of torsion. Arterial flow persistence suggests early-stage torsion (venous occlusion precedes arterial).  
- Guarding and tenderness align with acute peritoneal irritation.  
- Recurrent ovarian cysts increase torsion risk (cyst adds mass, predisposing to twisting).  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Broad ligament:** Supports uterus and adnexa but does not contain ovarian vessels. Torsion here is rare and unrelated to venous flow disruption. **Unlikely.**  
2. **Round ligament:** Connects uterus to labia; unrelated to ovarian blood supply. Pain from stretching (e.g., pregnancy) but not vascular compromise. **Excluded.**  
3. **Ovarian ligament:** Connects ovary to uterus but lacks major vessels. Torsion here would not directly affect ovarian vein flow. **Unlikely.**  
4. **Cardinal ligament:** Supports cervix, contains uterine vessels. Irrelevant to ovarian vascularity. **Excluded.**  
5. **Infundibulopelvic ligament:** Contains ovarian artery/vein and suspends the ovary. Torsion occurs when the ovary twists around this ligament, compressing the vein (low-pressure) first, then the artery. **Strongly aligns with absent venous flow and preserved arterial flow.**  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 5 (Infundibulopelvic ligament) (骨盆漏斗韧带)**  
- **Key Evidence:**  
  - The infundibulopelvic ligament houses the ovarian vessels.  
  - Absent ovarian vein flow with preserved arterial flow is pathognomonic for torsion involving this ligament.  
  - Anatomically, torsion occurs when the ovary twists around its vascular pedicle (infundibulopelvic ligament), leading to venous congestion and ischemia.
