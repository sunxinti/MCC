**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**
- **Patient Information:** A 29-year-old primigravid woman at 35 weeks' gestation with no history of serious medical illness.
- **Chief Complaint:** Admitted to the hospital in labor.
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**
  - Fetal heartbeats not detectable by Doppler monitor upon admission.
  - Ultrasound findings: Decreased amniotic fluid, absence of fetal movement, respiration, and heart activity.
  - Birth outcome: Delivered a 2296 g male infant with no signs of life.
  - Physical examination: No visible malformations; placenta is unremarkable.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**
- **Timeline:** The patient had an uncomplicated pregnancy with a normal ultrasound at 22 weeks. The adverse findings arose at 35 weeks during labor.
- **Characteristics:**
  - **Fetal Demise Indicators:** Absence of fetal heartbeats, movement, and adequate amniotic fluid suggest intrauterine fetal death (IUFD).
  - **Birth Outcome:** Live birth of a non-viable infant without malformations indicates possible sudden fetal demise without identifiable structural anomalies.
- **Interrelationships:** The lack of malformations and an unremarkable placenta suggest that the fetal demise may not be due to congenital anomalies or placental insufficiency, directing the focus toward other potential causes such as genetic abnormalities, infections, or coagulation disorders.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**
- **Option 1: Perform karyotyping of amniotic fluid**
  - **Relevance:** Useful if there are suspected genetic abnormalities. However, absence of malformations makes this less immediate.
- **Option 2: Recommend autopsy of the infant**
  - **Relevance:** Standard procedure to determine the cause of fetal demise, especially when clinical findings are inconclusive.
  - **Alignment:** Directly addresses the need to understand the underlying cause of intrauterine fetal death.
- **Option 3: Obtain photographs, x-ray imaging, and MRI**
  - **Relevance:** Part of a comprehensive autopsy but not as conclusive on its own.
- **Option 4: Perform maternal antibody and thrombophilia testing**
  - **Relevance:** Relevant for suspected maternal coagulation disorders, but not the most immediate step without further indications.
- **Option 5: Obtain consent for parental genetic testing**
  - **Relevance:** Important if a genetic cause is suspected but secondary to determining the cause of fetal demise.

Based on clinical guidelines, after a fetal demise with no obvious cause, a thorough autopsy is recommended to ascertain the etiology, which can provide valuable information for future pregnancies.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Recommend autopsy of the infant)(建议对婴儿进行尸检)**

Qwen is reasoning the answer...

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 2 (Recommend autopsy of the infant)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 29-year-old primigravid woman at 35 weeks' gestation presents in labor with no prior medical issues or complications during pregnancy.  
- Key symptoms on admission: inability to detect fetal heartbeats via Doppler, ultrasound showing decreased amniotic fluid, and absence of fetal movement/respiration/heart activity.  
- The infant born weighs 2296 g (near the 10th percentile for gestational age) and shows no signs of life or visible malformations. The placenta is unremarkable.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline**: The fetus was normal at 22 weeks’ ultrasound but showed abrupt deterioration between 22 and 35 weeks, leading to intrauterine fetal demise.  
- **Decreased amniotic fluid (oligohydramnios)** suggests fetal renal dysfunction (e.g., Potter sequence) or fetal nonviability.  
- **No fetal movement/respiration/heart activity on ultrasound** indicates irreversible fetal compromise.  
- **Normal placenta** reduces the likelihood of placental insufficiency (e.g., abruption, previa) but does not exclude thrombophilic or autoimmune causes.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (Karyotyping of amniotic fluid):** Less appropriate post-delivery, as fetal tissues (e.g., cord blood, placenta) are better sources for genetic analysis.  
- **Option 2 (Infant autopsy):** Critical to identify structural abnormalities, infections, or genetic causes not visible externally. Autopsy is a cornerstone of stillbirth evaluation.  
- **Option 3 (Photographs/X-ray/MRI):** Limited utility without prior suspicion of skeletal or structural anomalies. Autopsy provides more comprehensive findings.  
- **Option 4 (Maternal antibody/thrombophilia testing):** Important for future pregnancy planning but secondary to immediate postmortem evaluation.  
- **Option 5 (Parental genetic testing):** Essential if autopsy/gene testing is inconclusive but not the first-line step.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Recommend autopsy of the infant) (推荐对婴儿进行尸检)**  

**Key Evidence Supporting the Choice**:  
- Autopsy is the most effective immediate step to identify causes of fetal demise (e.g., congenital anomalies, infections, or chromosomal abnormalities).  
- Guidelines (e.g., ACOG) strongly recommend autopsy, placental examination, and karyotyping in stillbirths to determine etiology and guide future management.  
- The placenta’s normal appearance and lack of visible fetal malformations necessitate a deeper postmortem investigation.

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 2 (Recommend autopsy of the infant)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 29-year-old primigravida at 35 weeks’ gestation, uncomplicated pregnancy, normal 22-week ultrasound.  
- **Key Findings**:  
  - **Antepartum**: Absent fetal heart activity on Doppler and ultrasound (no movement, respiration, or cardiac activity), oligohydramnios.  
  - **Postpartum**: Stillborn male infant (2296 g), no visible malformations, normal placenta.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline**: Sudden intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD) at 35 weeks, preceded by normal prenatal surveillance until 22 weeks.  
- **Critical Features**:  
  - **Oligohydramnios**: Suggests chronic placental insufficiency or fetal compromise.  
  - **Absent Congenital Anomalies**: Reduces likelihood of structural/genetic defects as the primary cause.  
  - **Normal Placenta**: Does not support acute placental abruption or gross pathology.  
- **Interrelationships**: Unexplained IUFD with oligohydramnios points toward chronic placental dysfunction, thrombophilia, or occult maternal/fetal conditions.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (Karyotyping amniotic fluid)**: Less relevant post-delivery; fetal tissue karyotyping is preferred if autopsy is declined. Limited utility without suspected chromosomal anomalies.  
- **Option 2 (Autopsy)**: **Most critical**. Identifies structural, genetic, or infectious causes (e.g., cord accident, undetected malformations, infection). Essential for guiding future pregnancies.  
- **Option 3 (Imaging)**: Photographs/X-rays/MRI supplement autopsy but do not replace histopathological evaluation. Secondary to autopsy.  
- **Option 4 (Maternal testing)**: Important for thrombophilia (e.g., antiphospholipid syndrome) or alloimmunization but typically follows autopsy to prioritize testing.  
- **Option 5 (Parental genetic testing)**: Indicated only if fetal karyotyping reveals heritable disorders, which is premature without autopsy findings.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Recommend autopsy of the infant) (建议对婴儿进行尸检)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Autopsy is the gold standard for determining IUFD etiology, especially in cases without apparent anomalies.  
  - Identifies occult causes (e.g., infections, cord accidents, metabolic disorders) and informs recurrence risk.  
  - Clinical guidelines (e.g., ACOG) emphasize autopsy as the cornerstone of stillbirth evaluation. Maternal testing (Option 4) is complementary but secondary.
