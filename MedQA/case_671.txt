Case_description: 
A 19-year-old man with a past medical history significant only for facial acne presents with increased inguinal pruritis. Relevant social history includes participation in school wrestling. He has no significant family history. Other than the pruritic rash, a review of systems is negative.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options: 
1. Tinea corporis
2. Tinea cruris
3. Candidal balanitis
4. Pityriasis rosea
5. Tinea unguium

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** 19-year-old male with a past medical history notable for facial acne.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Increased pruritus (itching) in the inguinal region.  
- **Social History:** Engages in school wrestling, indicating frequent close skin-to-skin contact and potential for skin irritation from sweating and friction.  
- **Clinical Manifestations:** Presents with an erythematous, well-demarcated patch located on the left thigh, over the pubic region, and throughout the perineum. Notably, the scrotum is spared.  
- **Additional Findings:** No other symptoms reported; review of systems is negative apart from the pruritic rash.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Pruritic Rash Location:** The involvement of the groin, thigh, pubic area, and perineum with sparing of the scrotum suggests a condition that affects the flexural areas without genital involvement.  
- **Rash Characteristics:** An erythematous and well-demarcated patch is consistent with dermatophyte infections or inflammatory skin conditions.  
- **Occupational Exposure:** Participation in wrestling increases the risk of fungal infections due to constant moisture, friction, and close contact with others.  
- **Absence of Scrotal Involvement:** Helps in differentiating between various dermatological conditions affecting the groin area.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**

1. **Tinea corporis (Option 1):**  
   - **Alignment with Presentation:** Tinea corporis, or "ringworm," is a dermatophyte infection presenting as erythematous, well-demarcated, scaly patches that can occur anywhere on the body except the scalp and genitalia.  
   - **Relevance:** While it matches the description of the rash, the localization primarily in the groin area suggests a more specific diagnosis.

2. **Tinea cruris (Option 2):**  
   - **Alignment with Presentation:** Tinea cruris, commonly known as "jock itch," specifically affects the groin, inner thighs, and buttocks. It presents as a well-demarcated, erythematous, pruritic patch, often with a scaly border.  
   - **Relevance:** The patient's history of wrestling and the specific distribution of the rash strongly support this diagnosis.

3. **Candidal balanitis (Option 3):**  
   - **Alignment with Presentation:** Candidal balanitis affects the glans penis, presenting with redness, itching, and possible discharge.  
   - **Relevance:** The scrotum is spared, and there is no mention of penile involvement, making this diagnosis less likely.

4. **Pityriasis rosea (Option 4):**  
   - **Alignment with Presentation:** Pityriasis rosea typically presents with a herald patch followed by a generalized scaly rash, often on the trunk and proximal extremities.  
   - **Relevance:** The localized presentation in the groin and specific areas does not align well with pityriasis rosea.

5. **Tinea unguium (Option 5):**  
   - **Alignment with Presentation:** Tinea unguium refers to fungal infections of the nails (onychomycosis).  
   - **Relevance:** The patient has no reported nail involvement, making this diagnosis irrelevant.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Tinea cruris)(股癣)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 2 (Tinea cruris)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 19-year-old male with facial acne presents with worsening inguinal pruritus.  
- Key clinical findings: erythematous, well-demarcated patches on the left thigh, pubic region, and perineum, with the scrotum spared.  
- The patient participates in wrestling, a risk factor for fungal infections.  
- Symptoms are localized to areas of skin-to-skin contact and moisture, which are typical for certain dermatological conditions.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Location and Distribution**: The rash involves the groin, thigh, and perineum but spares the scrotum. This distribution is classic for tinea cruris (jock itch), as the infection often spreads around the groin but avoids areas with thicker skin (e.g., scrotum).  
- **Physical Characteristics**: Erythematous, well-demarcated patches suggest a fungal infection. The spared scrotum opposes candidal balanitis (which typically involves the glans penis and foreskin) and pityriasis rosea (which presents with oval, salmon-colored lesions).  
- **Risk Factors**: Wrestling involves skin-to-skin contact, sweating, and friction—ideal conditions for dermatophyte growth, which causes tinea infections.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Tinea corporis (1)**: A common fungal infection, but typically presents on non-groin areas (e.g., arms, trunk) and does not spare the scrotum. Less likely given the groin distribution.  
- **Tinea cruris (2)**: Strongly supported. The groin location, spared scrotum, and well-demarcated erythema align perfectly. Wrestling increases risk due to fungal exposure.  
- **Candidal balanitis (3)**: Causes erythema and swelling of the glans penis and foreskin, not the thigh or perineum. The spared scrotum also opposes this diagnosis.  
- **Pityriasis rosea (4)**: Begins with a herald patch followed by oval lesions, often on the trunk. The rash distribution and lack of a herald patch make this less likely.  
- **Tinea unguium (5)**: Involves fungal infection of the nails, which is unrelated to the described skin findings.

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 2 (Tinea cruris)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Profile**: 19-year-old male, history of facial acne, school wrestler.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Increased inguinal pruritus.  
- **Key Findings**: Erythematous, well-demarcated patches on the left thigh, pubic region, and perineum; scrotum spared. No systemic symptoms.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Distribution**: Involvement of the groin (inguinal region), thigh, and perineum, with scrotal sparing, strongly suggests a dermatophyte infection localized to intertriginous areas.  
- **Rash Characteristics**: Well-demarcated erythematous patches align with fungal infections (tinea), which often exhibit central clearing or scaling.  
- **Social History**: Wrestling increases exposure to dermatophytes via skin-to-skin contact and shared equipment.  
- **Scrotal Sparing**: A hallmark of **tinea cruris** (unlike candidiasis, which often involves the scrotum).  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Tinea corporis**: Affects trunk/limbs but not classically concentrated in the groin; less likely given the distribution.  
2. **Tinea cruris**: Classic presentation in young males, inguinal/perineal involvement, scrotal sparing, and wrestling history strongly support this diagnosis.  
3. **Candidal balanitis**: Typically involves the glans penis/scrotum with satellite lesions; scrotal sparing makes this unlikely.  
4. **Pityriasis rosea**: Presents with a herald patch and Christmas-tree distribution on the trunk; lacks pruritus and groin involvement.  
5. **Tinea unguium**: Nail infection, unrelated to the described rash.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Tinea cruris)** (股癣)  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Classic distribution (groin, perineum, thigh) with scrotal sparing.  
  - Pruritic, well-demarcated erythematous patches.  
  - Wrestling history (high-risk activity for dermatophyte transmission).  
  - Exclusion of candidiasis (scrotal sparing) and other non-fungal etiologies.
