Case_description: 
A 63-year-old patient presents to the emergency department because of severe left leg pain and tingling. His condition started suddenly 30 minutes ago. He has had hypertension for the past 10 years for which he takes bisoprolol. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.7°F), the blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, and the pulse is 100/min and irregular. On physical examination, the patient appears in severe pain and his left leg is pale and cool. The popliteal pulse is weaker on the left side compared to the right side. Which of the following is the most common cause of this patient's condition?
Options: 
1. Vasculitis
2. Hyperhomocysteinemia
3. Arterial thrombosis
4. Arterial emboli
5. Arterial trauma
Correct Answer: Arterial emboli

GPT's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** 63-year-old male with a 10-year history of hypertension, managed with bisoprolol. No history of smoking or alcohol use.
- **Chief Complaint:** Severe left leg pain and tingling, onset suddenly 30 minutes prior to presentation.
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**
  - Vital Signs: Temperature 37.1°C, BP 130/80 mm Hg, pulse 100/min and irregular.
  - Physical Examination: Left leg is pale, cool, and the patient is in severe pain. Popliteal pulse on the left is weaker compared to the right.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Sudden Onset:** The acute presentation of severe pain and tingling suggests an abrupt vascular event.
- **Pallor and Coolness:** Indicative of compromised arterial blood flow to the limb.
- **Irregular Pulse:** Suggests possible atrial fibrillation, a known risk factor for embolic events.
- **Weakened Pulse on One Side:** Localizes the vascular compromise to the left leg, likely involving a major artery such as the femoral or popliteal artery.
- **Lack of Trauma History:** Reduces the likelihood of traumatic arterial injury.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**

1. **Vasculitis:**
   - **Likelihood:** Low. Vasculitis typically presents with more gradual onset symptoms and is often associated with systemic signs such as fever, weight loss, or other organ involvement.
   
2. **Hyperhomocysteinemia:**
   - **Likelihood:** Low. This condition is a risk factor for atherosclerosis and thrombotic events but does not typically present acutely. It is more associated with chronic vascular disease.
   
3. **Arterial Thrombosis:**
   - **Likelihood:** Moderate. Arterial thrombosis can cause acute limb ischemia; however, it is often related to underlying atherosclerosis. While possible, the suddenness and the presence of an irregular pulse make embolism more likely.
   
4. **Arterial Emboli:**
   - **Likelihood:** High. The sudden onset of symptoms, irregular pulse (suggestive of atrial fibrillation), and acute limb ischemia are highly consistent with an embolic event. Atrial fibrillation is a common source of arterial emboli.
   
5. **Arterial Trauma:**
   - **Likelihood:** Low. There is no history of recent trauma or injury to the limb, making this diagnosis improbable.

**4. Final Selection**

**My final selection is: Option 4 (Arterial emboli)(动脉栓塞)**

Qwen is reasoning the answer...

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 4 (Arterial emboli)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 63-year-old male with hypertension presents to the emergency department with sudden-onset severe left leg pain, tingling, pallor, and coolness.  
- Key symptoms/signs:  
  - **Acute onset (30 minutes)** of severe limb pain and paresthesia.  
  - **Pale and cool left leg** (indicative of acute arterial ischemia).  
  - **Weak left popliteal pulse** compared to the right.  
  - **Irregular pulse** (possible atrial fibrillation).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Sudden onset** of symptoms strongly suggests an acute arterial occlusion. The rapid development of pain, pallor, and pulselessness aligns with arterial ischemia.  
- **Irregular pulse** raises concern for **atrial fibrillation**, a common source of emboli. The absence of trauma or inflammatory signs (e.g., fever, elevated ESR) makes vasculitis or hyperhomocysteinemia less likely.  
- **Coolness and pallor** indicate reduced perfusion, consistent with acute arterial obstruction rather than venous thrombosis or non-occlusive causes.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **1. Vasculitis**: Unlikely due to the sudden onset and lack of systemic inflammatory signs (e.g., fever, rash, elevated inflammatory markers). Vasculitis typically progresses over days to weeks.  
- **2. Hyperhomocysteinemia**: A risk factor for thrombosis but not an acute cause. Symptoms would not develop abruptly.  
- **3. Arterial thrombosis**: Possible but less likely given the patient’s **irregular pulse**, which suggests an embolic source (e.g., cardiac origin). Thrombosis typically occurs in atherosclerotic plaques but would not explain the sudden onset as well as an embolus.  
- **4. Arterial emboli**: **Most likely**. The combination of acute limb ischemia, irregular pulse (suggesting atrial fibrillation), and absence of local trauma or vasculitis strongly supports an embolic event from the heart (e.g., atrial thrombus in atrial fibrillation).  
- **5. Arterial trauma**: No history of trauma or mechanism to explain injury.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Arterial emboli)(动脉栓塞)**

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 4 (Arterial emboli)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 63-year-old male with hypertension (on bisoprolol), nonsmoker, non-drinker.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Sudden-onset severe left leg pain and tingling (30 minutes duration).  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations**:  
  - Left leg pallor, coolness, and weaker popliteal pulse compared to the right.  
  - Irregular pulse (100/min), normal blood pressure (130/80 mmHg), and mild temperature elevation (37.1°C).  
- **Decisive Features**: Acute unilateral limb ischemia (sudden pain, pallor, coolness, diminished pulse) + irregular pulse (suggesting atrial fibrillation).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline**: Sudden onset (30 minutes) strongly indicates an acute vascular occlusion.  
- **Characteristics**:  
  - **Pallor, coolness, diminished pulse**: Classic signs of acute arterial occlusion.  
  - **Irregular pulse**: Likely atrial fibrillation (AF), a major risk factor for arterial emboli.  
  - **Absent trauma history**: Rules out arterial trauma.  
- **Interrelationships**: AF predisposes to thromboembolism; an embolus lodging in the left leg artery explains the acute ischemia.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Vasculitis**: Unlikely. Typically subacute/chronic, with systemic symptoms (e.g., fever, rash) and bilateral involvement.  
2. **Hyperhomocysteinemia**: A thrombophilia risk factor but does not directly cause acute ischemia; no evidence of chronic thrombosis.  
3. **Arterial Thrombosis**: Possible in atherosclerosis, but sudden onset without prior claudication or chronic PAD symptoms is atypical. Thrombosis usually occurs in pre-stenotic vessels.  
4. **Arterial Emboli**: Highly likely. Sudden occlusion in a previously normal artery aligns with embolic etiology. AF (suggested by irregular pulse) is the most common embolic source.  
5. **Arterial Trauma**: Excluded due to lack of injury history.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Arterial emboli)(动脉栓塞)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  1. Sudden-onset unilateral limb ischemia (pain, pallor, coolness, pulse deficit).  
  2. Irregular pulse (AF) as the embolic source.  
  3. Absence of trauma or chronic vascular disease history.  
- **Supporting Guideline**: Acute limb ischemia in AF patients is most commonly embolic (80–90% of cases) [Rutherford’s Vascular Surgery].
