**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** 59-year-old woman.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Noticed a lump in her left breast 2 weeks prior to the visit.  
- **Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - Physical examination revealed a firm, nontender mass close to the nipple in the left breast.  
  - Mammography identified an irregular calcified mass.  
  - Core needle biopsy confirmed invasive ductal carcinoma.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
The patient presents with a breast lump, which is a common presentation for breast cancer. The mass is described as firm and nontender, which is characteristic of malignant tumors rather than benign ones. The location near the nipple and the presence of irregular calcifications on mammography further support the suspicion of malignancy. The core needle biopsy confirming invasive ductal carcinoma establishes the diagnosis. Invasive ductal carcinoma is the most common type of breast cancer and is often associated with specific genetic alterations that can influence prognosis and treatment.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
Evaluating each diagnostic option in the context of invasive ductal carcinoma:

1. **HER2 (Option 1):**  
   - **Relevance:** HER2 (Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2) is overexpressed in approximately 15-20% of breast cancers, particularly in aggressive subtypes like invasive ductal carcinoma. HER2 overexpression is associated with increased tumor growth and poorer prognosis but also predicts responsiveness to HER2-targeted therapies such as trastuzumab.
   
2. **TP53 (Option 2):**  
   - **Relevance:** TP53 mutations are common in various cancers, including breast cancer, and are associated with poor prognosis. However, TP53 is typically mutated rather than overexpressed, and it is not as specific to breast cancer as HER2.
   
3. **BCR-ABL (Option 3):**  
   - **Relevance:** BCR-ABL is a fusion gene associated with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and certain types of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). It is not relevant to breast cancer.
   
4. **BRCA-2 (Option 4):**  
   - **Relevance:** BRCA2 mutations increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancers. However, BRCA2 is a tumor suppressor gene, and its mutation leads to loss of function rather than overexpression. It is more related to hereditary breast cancer risk rather than the genetic profile of sporadic invasive ductal carcinoma.
   
5. **BCL-2 (Option 5):**  
   - **Relevance:** BCL-2 is an anti-apoptotic protein overexpressed in some cancers, such as certain lymphomas. While BCL-2 can be expressed in breast cancer, it is not as prominently associated with invasive ductal carcinoma as HER2.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1 (HER2) (HER2基因)**

Qwen is reasoning the answer...

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 1 (HER2)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 59-year-old woman presents with a 2-week history of a lump in her left breast.  
- Clinical examination reveals a firm, nontender mass near the nipple.  
- Mammography shows an irregular calcified mass, and core needle biopsy confirms invasive ductal carcinoma.  
- Key features: Firm, nontender breast mass, irregular calcifications, and histologic confirmation of invasive ductal carcinoma.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC):** The most common breast cancer subtype, often presenting as a firm mass. The irregular calcifications on mammography suggest malignant features (e.g., microcalcifications are common in ductal carcinoma).  
- **Timeline:** The 2-week duration of symptom onset is typical for a palpable mass in breast cancer, though asymptomatic growth may have preceded it.  
- **Genetic Correlation:** The question focuses on genetic overexpression in cancer cells. Key subtypes of IDC are defined by receptor status (e.g., ER, PR, HER2) and molecular markers, which influence prognosis and treatment.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (HER2):** HER2 overexpression/amplification occurs in ~20–25% of breast cancers. HER2-positive tumors are often aggressive, firm, and associated with poor prognosis. Testing for HER2 is routine in breast cancer diagnosis, and this aligns with the clinical presentation of invasive ductal carcinoma.  
- **Option 2 (TP53):** TP53 mutations are linked to triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which lacks ER, PR, and HER2 expression. However, the case does not mention hormone receptor status, and TP53 mutations typically lead to loss of function (not overexpression). Thus, this is less likely.  
- **Option 3 (BCR-ABL):** This fusion gene is associated with hematologic malignancies (e.g., chronic myeloid leukemia), not solid tumors like breast cancer. Irrelevant to this case.  
- **Option 4 (BRCA-2):** Germline BRCA mutations increase breast cancer risk but are associated with hereditary non-syndromic cancers. The question asks about **overexpression** of cancer cells, not germline mutations. BRCA-2 mutations lead to loss of tumor suppressor function, not overexpression, making this option incorrect.  
- **Option 5 (BCL-2):** Overexpression of BCL-2 is seen in lymphomas and some breast cancer subtypes (e.g., lobular carcinoma). However, it is less commonly linked to invasive ductal carcinoma compared to HER2.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1 (HER2) (人表皮生长因子受体2)**  

**Key Evidence Supporting HER2 Overexpression:**  
- HER2 overexpression/amplification is a well-established genetic alteration in breast cancer, particularly in invasive ductal carcinoma.  
- The clinical presentation (firm mass, irregular calcifications) aligns with HER2-positive tumors, which are often aggressive and histologically distinct.  
- HER2 testing is standard in breast cancer workup, and its overexpression directly impacts treatment decisions (e.g., trastuzumab).  
- Other options are either unrelated (BCR-ABL), associated with different subtypes (TP53 in triple-negative), or not linked to overexpression (BRCA-2, BCL-2).

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 1 (HER2)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Profile**: 59-year-old woman.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Left breast lump noticed 2 weeks prior.  
- **Key Findings**: Firm, nontender left breast mass near the nipple; mammography reveals an irregular calcified mass; biopsy confirms **invasive ductal carcinoma**.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Mass Characteristics**: Firm, irregular, and calcified masses on imaging are classic features of malignancy.  
- **Biopsy Confirmation**: Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most common breast cancer subtype, often associated with specific genetic markers.  
- **Nontender Nature**: Reduces likelihood of inflammatory or infectious etiology.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **HER2**: Overexpressed in ~20-30% of breast cancers. HER2-positive tumors are aggressive but targetable (e.g., trastuzumab). Strongly aligns with IDC and calcifications.  
2. **TP53**: Mutations (not overexpression) are common in cancers, but overexpression is rare and nonspecific.  
3. **BCR-ABL**: Fusion gene specific to chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), irrelevant to breast cancer.  
4. **BRCA-2**: Germline mutations increase hereditary risk, but the question focuses on tumor genetic overexpression, not germline defects.  
5. **BCL-2**: Overexpressed in some breast cancers but lacks diagnostic specificity; more relevant in lymphomas.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1 (HER2)(人类表皮生长因子受体2)**  
- **Key Evidence**: HER2 overexpression is a hallmark of ~20-30% of invasive ductal carcinomas, guides targeted therapy, and correlates with aggressive histology (e.g., irregular calcifications). Other options lack direct relevance to tumor-specific genetic overexpression in IDC.
