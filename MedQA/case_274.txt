Case_description: 
A 67-year-old white man presents to his primary care provider for an annual examination. He notes a pink bump that has rapidly developed on his forehead over the last month. In the past, he has had significant sun exposure including multiple blistering sunburns. The physical examination reveals a 2 cm dome-shaped plaque with a central keratin plug (as shown in the image). Excisional biopsy of the lesion reveals an exophytic nodule with central invagination, full of keratin. Keratinocyte atypia is minimal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options: 
1. Keratoacanthoma
2. Basal cell carcinoma
3. Seborrheic keratosis
4. Molluscum contagiosum
5. Kaposi's sarcoma
Correct Answer: Keratoacanthoma

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**
- **Patient Information:** A 67-year-old white man.
- **Chief Complaint:** Noticed a pink bump on his forehead that has rapidly developed over the last month.
- **Relevant History:** Significant sun exposure with multiple blistering sunburns in the past.
- **Clinical Manifestations:**
  - Physical examination reveals a 2 cm dome-shaped plaque with a central keratin plug.
  - Excisional biopsy shows an exophytic nodule with central invagination, filled with keratin.
  - Minimal keratinocyte atypia is present.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**
- **Rapid Development:** The lesion developed over a month, indicating a rapidly growing process.
- **Morphology:** A dome-shaped plaque with a central keratin plug is characteristic of certain skin lesions.
- **Sun Exposure History:** Significant sun exposure and blistering sunburns are risk factors for various skin neoplasms.
- **Histopathology:** The biopsy findings of an exophytic nodule with central invagination and abundant keratin, along with minimal atypia, suggest a lesion that is proliferative but not highly atypical.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**
1. **Keratoacanthoma:**
   - **Supportive Features:** Rapid growth over weeks to a few months, dome-shaped nodule with a central keratin plug, history of significant sun exposure.
   - **Histopathology:** Exophytic growth with central keratin-filled invagination and minimal atypia align well with this diagnosis.
   - **Conclusion:** Highly consistent with the presented case.

2. **Basal Cell Carcinoma:**
   - **Supportive Features:** Common in sun-exposed areas, especially in older individuals.
   - **Contrary Features:** Typically presents as a pearly nodule with telangiectasia rather than a dome-shaped plaque with a central keratin plug. Histologically, may show more pronounced atypia.
   - **Conclusion:** Less consistent with the current clinical and histological findings.

3. **Seborrheic Keratosis:**
   - **Supportive Features:** Common benign skin lesion.
   - **Contrary Features:** Usually presents as a waxy, "stuck-on" plaque without rapid growth or a central keratin plug. Histology differs significantly.
   - **Conclusion:** Unlikely given the clinical presentation and biopsy results.

4. **Molluscum Contagiosum:**
   - **Supportive Features:** Presents as umbilicated papules.
   - **Contrary Features:** More common in children or immunocompromised adults, does not typically present as a large dome-shaped plaque with keratin plug.
   - **Conclusion:** Unlikely in this context.

5. **Kaposi's Sarcoma:**
   - **Supportive Features:** Vascular tumor often associated with HIV/AIDS.
   - **Contrary Features:** Presents as violaceous plaques or nodules, not typically with central keratin plugs or limited to sun-exposed areas in immunocompetent individuals.
   - **Conclusion:** Unlikely based on clinical presentation and patient history.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 1 (Keratoacanthoma) 卡氏角化瘤**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 1 (Keratoacanthoma)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 67-year-old white male presents with a rapidly developing (1-month duration) 2 cm dome-shaped plaque on the forehead, featuring a central keratin plug.  
- Key symptoms include the **rapid growth**, **central keratin plug**, and **dome-shaped appearance**. The patient’s history of significant sun exposure and blistering sunburns is also critical.  

---

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Rapid growth**: The lesion developed over 1 month, which is consistent with keratoacanthoma (rapidly growing in weeks) or aggressive BCC subtypes.  
- **Central keratin plug and invagination**: This is a hallmark of keratoacanthoma, where keratin accumulates in the central crater.  
- **Histopathology**: The biopsy shows an exophytic nodule with central invagination filled with keratin and **minimal keratinocyte atypia**, which aligns with keratoacanthoma (low-grade cytologic atypia) and contrasts with more aggressive tumors.  
- **Sun exposure history**: While BCC and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are associated with sun damage, keratoacanthoma is also linked to ultraviolet (UV) exposure.  

---

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **1. Keratoacanthoma**:  
  - **Supporting features**: Rapid growth, central keratin plug, dome-shaped lesion, minimal cytologic atypia, and UV exposure history.  
  - **Key point**: The histology (central invagination with keratin) and clinical presentation are textbook for keratoacanthoma.  

- **2. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC)**:  
  - **Possible features**: Sun-exposed location and dome-shaped appearance (e.g., nodular BCC).  
  - **Opposing features**: BCC typically lacks a central keratin plug and shows more pronounced cytologic atypia (e.g., palisading basaloid nests). The minimal atypia here reduces its likelihood.  

- **3. Seborrheic keratosis**:  
  - **Opposing features**: Slow-growing, waxy, verrucous appearance, and no central keratin plug. Rapid growth and histology exclude this.  

- **4. Molluscum contagiosum**:  
  - **Opposing features**: Small umbilicated papules caused by poxvirus; unrelated to sun exposure and unlikely to form a 2 cm plaque.  

- **5. Kaposi’s sarcoma**:  
  - **Opposing features**:紫红色斑块或结节，与免疫抑制相关，无中央角质栓。  

---

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1 Keratoacanthoma (角化棘皮瘤)**  

**Key evidence**:  
- Rapid growth over 1 month.  
- Central keratin plug and histologic invagination.  
- Minimal cytologic atypia in keratinocytes.  
- UV exposure history aligns with keratoacanthoma etiology.

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 67-year-old white man with significant sun exposure history (multiple blistering sunburns).  
- **Chief Complaint**: Rapidly growing pink bump on the forehead over 1 month.  
- **Key Findings**:  
  - **Physical Exam**: 2 cm dome-shaped plaque with central keratin plug.  
  - **Biopsy**: Exophytic nodule with central invagination filled with keratin; minimal keratinocyte atypia.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Rapid Growth**: Lesion developed over 1 month, typical of **keratoacanthoma** (KA), which classically grows rapidly over weeks.  
- **Morphology**: Dome-shaped plaque with central keratin plug aligns with KA’s "crateriform" appearance.  
- **Histopathology**: Central keratin-filled invagination and minimal atypia strongly favor KA over malignancies like squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) or basal cell carcinoma (BCC).  
- **Sun Exposure**: Supports UV-related lesions (e.g., KA, BCC) but opposes diagnoses like molluscum contagiosum or Kaposi’s sarcoma.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Keratoacanthoma (KA)**:  
   - Matches rapid growth, central keratin plug, and histopathology (exophytic nodule with keratin core). Minimal atypia distinguishes it from SCC.  
   - **Strongly Supported**.  
2. **Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)**:  
   - Typically presents as pearly papules with telangiectasia; histology shows basaloid cells with peripheral palisading. Absent here.  
   - **Unlikely**.  
3. **Seborrheic Keratosis**:  
   - Slow-growing, "stuck-on" appearance with hyperkeratosis. No rapid growth or keratin plug.  
   - **Excluded**.  
4. **Molluscum Contagiosum**:  
   - Small umbilicated papules in children/immunocompromised. Biopsy would show viral inclusions.  
   - **Excluded**.  
5. **Kaposi’s Sarcoma**:  
   - Violaceous lesions in immunocompromised patients. Histology shows spindle cells and vascular slits.  
   - **Excluded**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1 (Keratoacanthoma)(角化棘皮瘤)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Rapid growth over 1 month.  
  - Dome-shaped lesion with central keratin plug.  
  - Biopsy showing exophytic nodule with keratin-filled invagination and minimal atypia.  
  - Sun exposure history aligns with UV-related lesions like KA.
