Case_description: 
A 61-year-old man is brought to the emergency room with chest pain. He developed severe, crushing, substernal chest pain 10 hours ago while he was hiking in the Adirondack mountains. He was with 2 friends at the time who gave him aspirin before carrying him 5 miles to a town to get phone service, where they then called emergency medical services. His past medical history is notable for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. He takes enalapril, metformin, and atorvastatin. He has a 20-pack-year smoking history and is an avid hiker. His temperature is 100°F (37.8°C), blood pressure is 102/60 mmHg, pulse is 130/min, and respirations are 28/min. He is diaphoretic and intermittently conscious. Bilateral rales are heard on pulmonary auscultation. An electrocardiogram demonstrates ST elevations in leads I and aVL. Despite appropriate management, the patient expires. An autopsy is performed demonstrating ischemia in the left atrium and posterior left ventricle. Which of the following vessels was most likely affected in this patient?
Options: 
1. Left anterior descending artery
2. Left circumflex artery
3. Left coronary artery
4. Posterior descending artery
5. Right marginal artery
Correct Answer: Left circumflex artery

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** 61-year-old man with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and a 20-pack-year smoking history. Medications include enalapril, metformin, and atorvastatin.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Severe, crushing, substernal chest pain lasting 10 hours, initiated during hiking.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - **Vital Signs:** Temperature 100°F (37.8°C), blood pressure 102/60 mmHg, pulse 130/min, respirations 28/min.  
  - **Physical Exam:** Diaphoresis, intermittent consciousness, bilateral rales on pulmonary auscultation.  
  - **ECG Findings:** ST elevations in leads I and aVL.  
- **Outcome:** Despite management, the patient expired. Autopsy revealed ischemia in the left atrium and posterior left ventricle.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline and Characteristics:** The patient experienced acute onset of severe chest pain lasting over 10 hours, consistent with myocardial infarction (MI).  
- **ECG Interpretation:** ST elevations in leads I and aVL indicate anterolateral wall MI, suggesting involvement of the high lateral region of the left ventricle.  
- **Autopsy Findings:** Ischemia in the left atrium and posterior left ventricle points to compromised blood supply in regions typically served by the left circumflex artery and its branches.  
- **Clinical Signs:** Hypotension, tachycardia, increased respiratory rate, diaphoresis, and rales are indicative of significant cardiac dysfunction and possible heart failure secondary to extensive MI.  
- **Correlating Clinical and Autopsy Findings:** The ECG findings correlate with the autopsy findings, reinforcing the likelihood of left circumflex artery involvement as it supplies both the lateral wall and parts of the posterior left ventricle.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Left anterior descending artery**  
  - **Analysis:** Supplies the anterior wall and septum. ST elevations in leads I and aVL are less typical for LAD involvement.  
  - **Likelihood:** Low.  
- **Option 2: Left circumflex artery**  
  - **Analysis:** Supplies the lateral and sometimes posterior walls of the left ventricle. ST elevations in I and aVL align with LCx territory. Autopsy findings of the left atrium and posterior left ventricle ischemia support LCx involvement.  
  - **Likelihood:** High.  
- **Option 3: Left coronary artery**  
  - **Analysis:** The left coronary artery branches into LAD and LCx. While it is the main vessel, the specific territories affected point more towards a branch.  
  - **Likelihood:** Moderate but less specific.  
- **Option 4: Posterior descending artery**  
  - **Analysis:** Typically a branch of the right coronary artery in right-dominant systems or LCx in left-dominant systems. However, ST elevations in I and aVL are not directly indicative of PDA involvement.  
  - **Likelihood:** Low to moderate.  
- **Option 5: Right marginal artery**  
  - **Analysis:** Supplies the right margin of the heart, not primarily associated with the areas affected in this case.  
  - **Likelihood:** Low.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Left circumflex artery)(左旋冠狀動脈)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 2 (Left circumflex artery)

Qwen's full response:

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 61-year-old male with hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and a smoking history presents with severe, crushing substernal chest pain after hiking.  
- Key symptoms: Diaphoresis, tachycardia (130/min), tachypnea (28/min), fever (100°F), and intermittent consciousness.  
- Physical exam: Bilateral pulmonary rales (suggesting pulmonary edema or heart failure).  
- ECG shows ST elevations in leads I and aVL.  
- Autopsy findings: Ischemia in the left atrium and posterior left ventricle.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Chest Pain Characteristics**: The sudden onset of crushing substernal pain during exertion strongly suggests an acute coronary syndrome. The 10-hour delay in treatment likely worsened outcomes.  
- **ECG Findings**: ST elevations in leads I and aVL indicate a lateral wall myocardial infarction. These leads correspond to the lateral aspect of the left ventricle, typically supplied by the **left circumflex artery (LCX)**.  
- **Autopsy Findings**: The left atrium is primarily perfused by the LCX, and the posterior left ventricle is supplied by the posterior descending artery (PDA). However, the PDA is usually a branch of the right coronary artery (RCA) in 85% of cases but may arise from the LCX in 15% (left-dominant circulation). The combination of left atrial and posterior left ventricle ischemia suggests involvement of the LCX.  
- **Systemic Signs**: Fever, tachycardia, and pulmonary rales may reflect心源性休克 or myocardial dysfunction secondary to extensive ischemia.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (Left anterior descending artery [LAD])**: The LAD supplies the anterior and apical walls. ST elevations in leads V1–V4 would be expected, not I/aVL. The posterior/left atrial ischemia also does not align with LAD occlusion. **Unlikely**.  
- **Option 2 (Left circumflex artery [LCX])**: Matches the ECG findings (ST elevation in I/aVL) and autopsy findings (left atrium and posterior wall ischemia, assuming LCX supplies the PDA in this case). **Highly likely**.  
- **Option 3 (Left coronary artery)**: Complete occlusion of the left main coronary artery would cause immediate cardiogenic shock and widespread anterior/lateral ischemia. The autopsy focuses on posterior/left atrial ischemia, making this less likely. **Unlikely**.  
- **Option 4 (Posterior descending artery [PDA])**: Typically supplied by the RCA (not LCX). If occluded, it would primarily affect the posterior wall but not the left atrium. The ECG pattern (I/aVL) does not align. **Unlikely unless in left-dominant circulation with LCX supplying PDA**.  
- **Option 5 (Right marginal artery)**: Supplies the inferior wall and right ventricle. No inferior ECG changes (e.g., II, III, aVF) are noted. **Unlikely**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The combination of ECG changes (ST elevation in I/aVL) and autopsy findings (left atrium and posterior left ventricle ischemia) strongly supports occlusion of the **left circumflex artery**, especially if the patient had a left-dominant coronary circulation where the LCX supplies the posterior descending artery.  

**My final selection is: Option 2 (Left circumflex artery)(左旋支动脉)**

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Profile**: 61-year-old man with hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, smoking history (20-pack-year). Medications: enalapril, metformin, atorvastatin.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Severe, crushing substernal chest pain for 10 hours during hiking.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations**:  
  - Hypotension (102/60 mmHg), tachycardia (130/min), tachypnea (28/min), diaphoresis, intermittent consciousness.  
  - Bilateral rales (pulmonary congestion).  
  - ECG: ST elevations in leads I and aVL.  
  - Autopsy findings: Ischemia in the **left atrium** and **posterior left ventricle**.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline & Symptoms**: Acute-onset chest pain during exertion, delayed medical care, progression to cardiogenic shock (hypotension, tachycardia, pulmonary edema).  
- **ECG Localization**: ST elevations in leads I and aVL indicate **high lateral wall ischemia**.  
- **Autopsy Correlation**: Posterior left ventricular and left atrial ischemia suggest occlusion of a vessel supplying both regions.  
- **Critical Clues**:  
  - Left atrial ischemia is **specific to the left circumflex artery (LCx)**, which supplies the left atrium.  
  - Posterior left ventricular ischemia aligns with LCx (dominant LCx) or posterior descending artery (PDA), but PDA involvement typically causes inferior/posterior infarcts with ST elevations in II/III/aVF (absent here).  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Left anterior descending artery (LAD)**: Causes anterior wall ischemia (ST elevations in V1–V4). **Not consistent** with posterior LV or left atrial involvement.  
2. **Left circumflex artery (LCx)**: Supplies the lateral wall (ST elevations in I/aVL), posterior LV, and left atrium. **Perfectly matches** autopsy findings and ECG.  
3. **Left coronary artery (LCA)**: Occlusion would affect both LAD and LCx territories, causing widespread ST changes (e.g., anterior + lateral). **Unlikely** given localized findings.  
4. **Posterior descending artery (PDA)**: Typically causes inferior/posterior infarcts (ST elevations in II/III/aVF). **No ECG evidence** of inferior involvement.  
5. **Right marginal artery**: Supplies the right ventricle. **No clinical/ECG evidence** of RV infarction.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Left circumflex artery)(左回旋支动脉)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - ST elevations in I/aVL localize to the **lateral wall** (LCx territory).  
  - Autopsy confirms ischemia in the **posterior LV and left atrium**, both supplied by the LCx.  
  - Absence of inferior ECG changes (II/III/aVF) rules out RCA/PDA involvement.  
- **Conclusion**: LCx occlusion explains the clinical, ECG, and pathological findings.
