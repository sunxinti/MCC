**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**
- **Patient Information:** A 37-year-old woman.
- **Chief Complaint:** Heartburn.
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:** Persistent heartburn leading to further investigation.
- **Decisive Factors:** The diagnosis of a duodenal ulcer secondary to Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection was established after an extensive workup.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**
- **Symptom Timeline and Characteristics:** The patient presents with heartburn, a common symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and peptic ulcer disease. The chronicity and persistence of heartburn prompted further investigation.
- **Diagnostic Findings:** The identification of a duodenal ulcer indicates mucosal damage, often associated with excessive gastric acid secretion and H. pylori infection.
- **Interrelationships:** H. pylori infection is a well-known risk factor for the development of duodenal ulcers due to its role in disrupting the mucosal barrier and increasing acid secretion.
- **Supporting Features:** The presence of a duodenal ulcer and H. pylori infection supports the use of therapies targeting acid suppression and bacterial eradication.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**
- **Option 1: SST2 receptor agonist**
  - **Relevance:** SST2 receptors are somatostatin receptors involved in inhibiting hormone secretion. This mechanism is not directly related to acid suppression or ulcer treatment.
  - **Conclusion:** Unrelated to omeprazole’s action.

- **Option 2: Parasympathetic inhibition**
  - **Relevance:** While parasympathetic inhibition can reduce gastric secretions indirectly, omeprazole acts through a more direct mechanism.
  - **Conclusion:** Not the primary mechanism of omeprazole.

- **Option 3: Reversible block of H2 receptors**
  - **Relevance:** This describes the mechanism of H2 receptor antagonists like ranitidine, which reduce acid secretion by blocking histamine receptors on parietal cells.
  - **Conclusion:** Different from omeprazole’s mechanism.

- **Option 4: Inhibition of primary active transport**
  - **Relevance:** Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that specifically targets the H⁺/K⁺-ATPase enzyme (proton pump) on the parietal cells, inhibiting the final step of gastric acid secretion by blocking primary active transport.
  - **Conclusion:** Accurately describes omeprazole’s mechanism of action.

- **Option 5: Inhibition of 50S ribosomal subunit**
  - **Relevance:** This mechanism is associated with certain antibiotics (e.g., macrolides) and is unrelated to acid suppression.
  - **Conclusion:** Irrelevant to omeprazole’s function.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Inhibition of primary active transport)(抑制原发主动运输)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 4 (Inhibition of primary active transport)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 37-year-old woman presents with heartburn.  
- Diagnosed with a duodenal ulcer secondary to *H. pylori* infection.  
- Treated with triple therapy (omeprazole, clarithromycin, amoxicillin).  
- Key symptoms: Heartburn (a classic symptom of peptic ulcer disease due to gastric acid irritation).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- Duodenal ulcers are often linked to *H. pylori* infection or NSAID use. The absence of NSAID use (implied) supports *H. pylori* as the cause.  
- Heartburn suggests acid reflux or irritation of the duodenal mucosa.  
- Triple therapy is standard for *H. pylori* eradication, combining a PPI (omeprazole), clarithromycin, and amoxicillin.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: SST2 receptor agonist**  
  - Somatostatin receptor agonists (e.g., octreotide) inhibit gastrin and acid secretion but are not PPIs. Omeprazole is unrelated. **Unlikely.**  

- **Option 2: Parasympathetic inhibition**  
  - Anticholinergics (e.g., ipratropium) block parasympathetic stimulation of acid secretion. Omeprazole acts directly on parietal cells, not via parasympathetic pathways. **Unlikely.**  

- **Option 3: Reversible block of H2 receptors**  
  - H2 receptor antagonists (e.g., ranitidine) reversibly inhibit histamine-mediated acid secretion. Omeprazole irreversibly inhibits the proton pump, not H2 receptors. **Incorrect.**  

- **Option 4: Inhibition of primary active transport**  
  - Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that irreversibly blocks the H+/K+-ATPase enzyme (primary active transport system) in parietal cells, halting acid secretion. This matches the mechanism. **Highly likely.**  

- **Option 5: Inhibition of 50S ribosomal subunit**  
  - This describes macrolide antibiotics (e.g., clarithromycin), which target bacterial protein synthesis. Irrelevant to omeprazole’s action. **Unlikely.**  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Inhibition of primary active transport)(抑制原发性主动运输)**

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 4 (Inhibition of primary active transport)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 37-year-old woman presents with heartburn. Diagnosis: duodenal ulcer secondary to *H. pylori* infection. Prescribed triple therapy (omeprazole, clarithromycin, amoxicillin).  
- Key diagnostic features: Confirmed *H. pylori* infection and duodenal ulcer, prompting eradication therapy.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- Heartburn and confirmed *H. pylori* infection align with duodenal ulcer pathophysiology. Triple therapy targets *H. pylori* (antibiotics) and acid suppression (omeprazole).  
- Omeprazole’s role: Acid suppression is critical for ulcer healing and enhancing antibiotic efficacy.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **SST2 receptor agonist**: Somatostatin analogs (e.g., octreotide) inhibit acid via SST2 receptors. **Not applicable**—PPIs act independently of SST2.  
2. **Parasympathetic inhibition**: Anticholinergics reduce acid via muscarinic receptor blockade. **Irrelevant**—omeprazole does not target parasympathetic pathways.  
3. **Reversible H2 receptor block**: H2 blockers (e.g., ranitidine) competitively inhibit histamine receptors. **Incorrect**—PPIs inhibit proton pumps, not H2 receptors.  
4. **Inhibition of primary active transport**: PPIs irreversibly block H+/K+ ATPase (proton pump), a primary active transporter. **Correct**—this is the definitive mechanism of omeprazole.  
5. **50S ribosomal subunit inhibition**: Macrolides (e.g., clarithromycin) inhibit bacterial protein synthesis. **Incorrect**—omeprazole is not an antibiotic.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Inhibition of primary active transport)(抑制原发性主动转运)**  
- Key evidence: Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that irreversibly blocks the H+/K+ ATPase pump (a primary active transporter) in gastric parietal cells, reducing acid secretion. This mechanism is central to its role in ulcer healing and *H. pylori* eradication therapy.
