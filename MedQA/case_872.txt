Case_description: 
An 18-year-old male presents to the emergency department trauma bay with a gunshot wound to the abdomen. The patient undergoes an exploratory laparotomy, during which, it is discovered that his splenic artery was damaged at its origin from the celiac trunk. The surgeon ligates the splenic artery at its origin. Which of the following arteries will now be hypoperfused as a result?
Options: 
1. Left gastric artery
2. Gastroduodenal artery
3. Right gastroepiploic artery
4. Left gastroepiploic artery
5. Common hepatic artery
Correct Answer: Left gastroepiploic artery

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** An 18-year-old male.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Gunshot wound to the abdomen.  
- **Clinical Manifestations:** The patient presents to the emergency department trauma bay and undergoes an exploratory laparotomy. During surgery, a splenic artery injury at its origin from the celiac trunk is identified, and the artery is ligated at its origin.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Injury Mechanism:** The patient sustained a gunshot wound, a high-velocity trauma likely causing significant vascular damage.  
- **Surgical Findings:** The splenic artery, a major branch of the celiac trunk, is damaged at its origin.  
- **Intervention:** Ligating the splenic artery at its origin stops blood flow through this artery, impacting all downstream branches dependent on it for perfusion.  
- **Implications of Ligation:** Since the splenic artery arises directly from the celiac trunk, its ligation affects the perfusion of arteries that branch from it but should not directly impact other branches of the celiac trunk.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Left gastric artery**  
  - **Origin:** Directly branches from the celiac trunk.  
  - **Impact:** Unaffected by ligation of the splenic artery; remains perfused via the celiac trunk.  
- **Option 2: Gastroduodenal artery**  
  - **Origin:** Branches from the common hepatic artery, which arises from the celiac trunk.  
  - **Impact:** Remains perfused through the common hepatic artery despite ligation of the splenic artery.  
- **Option 3: Right gastroepiploic artery**  
  - **Origin:** Derived from the gastroduodenal artery.  
  - **Impact:** Indirectly supplied via the gastroduodenal and common hepatic arteries; unaffected by splenic artery ligation.  
- **Option 4: Left gastroepiploic artery**  
  - **Origin:** Branches directly from the splenic artery.  
  - **Impact:** Directly dependent on the splenic artery for perfusion; ligation leads to hypoperfusion.  
- **Option 5: Common hepatic artery**  
  - **Origin:** Direct branch from the celiac trunk.  
  - **Impact:** Remains perfused independently of the splenic artery ligation.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Left gastroepiploic artery)(左胃胰动脉)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 4 (Left gastroepiploic artery)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- An 18-year-old male presents with a gunshot wound to the abdomen, leading to exploratory laparotomy.  
- Key finding: Splenic artery damage at its origin from the celiac trunk, which was ligated during surgery.  
- The critical issue is identifying which artery will be hypoperfused due to loss of splenic artery flow.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- The splenic artery arises directly from the celiac trunk. Ligation at its origin severs all downstream blood flow to its branches.  
- The celiac trunk typically branches into three main arteries: the **left gastric artery**, **common hepatic artery**, and **splenic artery**.  
- The **left gastroepiploic artery** is a major branch of the splenic artery, supplying the greater curvature of the stomach and omentum.  
- Other arteries (e.g., gastroduodenal artery, right gastroepiploic artery) arise from the common hepatic artery or its branches, independent of the splenic artery.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Left gastric artery**  
  - Arises directly from the celiac trunk, independent of the splenic artery.  
  - **Unaffected**, as its blood supply remains intact.  

- **Option 2: Gastroduodenal artery**  
  - A branch of the common hepatic artery (from the celiac trunk).  
  - **Unaffected**, as its origin is preserved.  

- **Option 3: Right gastroepiploic artery**  
  - Originates from the gastroduodenal artery (via the superior pancreaticoduodenal artery).  
  - **Unaffected**, as its blood supply is maintained through the common hepatic artery.  

- **Option 4: Left gastroepiploic artery**  
  - A direct branch of the splenic artery.  
  - **Hypoperfused**, as the splenic artery’s origin is ligated, cutting off its blood supply.  

- **Option 5: Common hepatic artery**  
  - Arises directly from the celiac trunk, independent of the splenic artery.  
  - **Unaffected**, as its origin remains intact.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Left gastroepiploic artery)(左胃网膜动脉)**  

**Key Evidence Supporting the Choice:**  
- The left gastroepiploic artery is a direct branch of the splenic artery. Ligation of the splenic artery at its origin from the celiac trunk severs all downstream flow to its branches, including the left gastroepiploic artery.  
- Other arteries listed (left gastric, gastroduodenal, right gastroepiploic, common hepatic) arise from the celiac trunk or its other branches (common hepatic artery), which remain intact after splenic artery ligation.

DeepSeek is reasoning the answer...

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 4 (Left gastroepiploic artery)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 18-year-old male with a gunshot wound to the abdomen.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations**: Damage to the splenic artery at its origin from the celiac trunk during exploratory laparotomy, requiring ligation of the splenic artery.  
- **Decisive Feature**: Surgical ligation of the splenic artery at its origin directly disrupts blood flow to its downstream branches.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- The splenic artery originates from the celiac trunk and courses toward the spleen, giving off branches such as the **left gastroepiploic artery** and pancreatic arteries.  
- Ligating the splenic artery at its origin halts perfusion to all its distal branches.  
- The celiac trunk’s other branches (left gastric artery, common hepatic artery) remain unaffected unless the ligation extends proximally, which is not described here.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Left gastric artery**: Originates directly from the celiac trunk; unaffected by splenic artery ligation.  
2. **Gastroduodenal artery**: Branch of the common hepatic artery; unrelated to splenic artery ligation.  
3. **Right gastroepiploic artery**: Branch of the gastroduodenal artery (common hepatic artery); unaffected.  
4. **Left gastroepiploic artery**: Direct branch of the splenic artery; hypoperfusion is inevitable after splenic artery ligation.  
5. **Common hepatic artery**: Originates from the celiac trunk independently; unaffected.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Left gastroepiploic artery)(左胃网膜动脉)**  
- **Key Evidence**: The left gastroepiploic artery is a direct branch of the splenic artery. Ligating the splenic artery at its origin disrupts blood flow to this artery, leading to hypoperfusion. Other listed arteries are supplied by separate celiac trunk branches and remain unaffected.
