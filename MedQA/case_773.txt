**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**
- **Patient Information:** 21-year-old female with a history of amenorrhea and infertility.
- **Chief Complaint:** Elevated blood pressure detected during a health screening; confirmed office blood pressure of 168/114 mm Hg.
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**
  - Physical Appearance: Short stature, normal weight, webbed neck.
  - Medication History: Denies taking any medications.
  
**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**
- **Hypertension in a Young Female:** The significant elevation of blood pressure in a young patient suggests secondary causes rather than essential hypertension.
- **Physical Features:** Short stature and a webbed neck are characteristic of Turner syndrome, which is associated with various congenital anomalies, including cardiovascular and renal abnormalities.
- **Reproductive History:** Amenorrhea and infertility further support a diagnosis of Turner syndrome, as gonadal dysgenesis is common in this condition.
- **Absence of Medication Use:** Rules out medication-induced hypertension (e.g., oral contraceptives, corticosteroids).

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**
1. **Central fusion of the inferior poles of the kidneys (Option 1):**
   - **Relevance:** Renal artery anomalies, such as fibromuscular dysplasia or other renal fusion abnormalities, can lead to renovascular hypertension.
   - **Alignment with Clinical Features:** In Turner syndrome, renal anomalies are common, which can explain the hypertension.
   
2. **Genetic predisposition to essential hypertension (Option 2):**
   - **Relevance:** Essential hypertension is less likely in a 21-year-old without a family history or other supporting factors.
   - **Alignment:** Does not explain the patient's specific physical features and reproductive history.
   
3. **Neuroendocrine tumor of the adrenal gland (Option 3):**
   - **Relevance:** Conditions like pheochromocytoma can cause severe hypertension but are typically accompanied by symptoms like headaches, palpitations, and sweating.
   - **Alignment:** Absence of such symptoms makes this less likely.
   
4. **Oral contraceptive use (Option 4):**
   - **Relevance:** Can cause elevated blood pressure but the patient denies medication use.
   - **Alignment:** Not applicable due to denial of medication use.
   
5. **Chronic corticosteroid use (Option 5):**
   - **Relevance:** Can lead to hypertension, but there is no history of corticosteroid use.
   - **Alignment:** Not applicable as the patient denies medication use.

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 1 (Central fusion of the inferior poles of the kidneys)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 21-year-old female with newly detected hypertension (168/114 mmHg).  
- **Key symptoms**: History of amenorrhea and infertility, short stature, and a webbed neck.  
- **Decisive features**: Webbed neck, short stature, amenorrhea, and infertility, which collectively suggest a genetic syndrome.  

---

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Amenorrhea and infertility**: These are hallmark features of **Turner syndrome** (45,X karyotype), which is associated with ovarian dysgenesis.  
- **Webbed neck and short stature**: These are classic physical stigmata of Turner syndrome.  
- **Hypertension**: While hypertension in Turner syndrome can arise from coarctation of the aorta or renal anomalies (e.g., horseshoe kidney), the provided diagnostic options include "central fusion of the inferior poles of the kidneys" (horseshoe kidney), which is a renal abnormality linked to Turner syndrome.  
- **Denial of medication use**: Excludes options like oral contraceptives or corticosteroids (options 4 and 5).  
- **Young age**: Essential hypertension (option 2) is less likely without a strong family history. Neuroendocrine tumors (option 3) typically present with episodic hypertension and paroxysmal symptoms (e.g., headaches, palpitations), which are not described here.  

---

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Central fusion of the inferior poles of the kidneys (horseshoe kidney)**:  
   - **Likelihood**: High. Turner syndrome is strongly associated with renal anomalies, including horseshoe kidney. Renal malformations can lead to hypertension via structural abnormalities or renal artery stenosis.  
   - **Alignment**: The patient’s short stature, webbed neck, and amenorrhea strongly suggest Turner syndrome, which is linked to horseshoe kidney.  

2. **Genetic predisposition to essential hypertension**:  
   - **Likelihood**: Low. Essential hypertension is uncommon in young adults without a family history. The physical exam findings contradict a diagnosis of essential hypertension.  

3. **Neuroendocrine tumor of the adrenal gland (e.g., pheochromocytoma)**:  
   - **Likelihood**: Low. Pheochromocytomas typically cause paroxysmal hypertension with episodic symptoms (e.g., sweating, tachycardia). The absence of such symptoms and the patient’s chronic hypertension make this less likely.  

4. **Oral contraceptive use**:  
   - **Likelihood**: Excluded. The patient explicitly denies current medication use.  

5. **Chronic corticosteroid use**:  
   - **Likelihood**: Excluded. The patient denies medication use, and corticosteroids would typically cause central obesity, which is absent here.  

---

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1 (Central fusion of the inferior poles of the kidneys) (肾脏下极中央融合)**  

**Key evidence**:  
- The combination of short stature, webbed neck, and amenorrhea strongly indicates **Turner syndrome**, a condition commonly associated with renal anomalies such as horseshoe kidney.  
- Horseshoe kidney can lead to hypertension due to structural renal abnormalities or renal artery stenosis, making it the most plausible diagnosis among the options provided.

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Profile**: 21-year-old female with a history of amenorrhea and infertility.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Elevated blood pressure (168/114 mmHg) detected during screening.  
- **Key Clinical Features**:  
  - Hypertension (Stage 2: 168/114 mmHg).  
  - Short stature, normal weight, webbed neck.  
  - Amenorrhea and infertility (previously evaluated).  
  - No current medication use.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Hypertension**: Severely elevated (Stage 2), unusual for a young patient without obesity or other typical risk factors. Suggests secondary etiology.  
- **Webbed Neck and Short Stature**: Classic phenotypic features of **Turner syndrome** (45,X karyotype), which is associated with congenital anomalies (e.g., renal, cardiovascular).  
- **Amenorrhea/Infertility**: Consistent with Turner syndrome (ovarian dysgenesis).  
- **Timeline**: Chronic issues (amenorrhea, short stature) and recent hypertension align with a congenital/developmental disorder.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Central fusion of the inferior poles of the kidneys (Horseshoe kidney)**  
   - Strongly linked to Turner syndrome. Renal anomalies (e.g., horseshoe kidney, vascular abnormalities) are present in 30-40% of Turner patients and can cause hypertension due to renal artery stenosis or compression.  
   - **Supports**: Turner-associated renal anomaly explains hypertension and syndromic features.  
   - **Opposes**: None; aligns perfectly with clinical findings.  

2. **Genetic predisposition to essential hypertension**  
   - Unlikely in a 21-year-old without family history or risk factors. Syndromic features (webbed neck, short stature) strongly suggest a secondary cause.  

3. **Neuroendocrine tumor of the adrenal gland**  
   - Pheochromocytoma classically causes paroxysmal hypertension with episodic symptoms (e.g., palpitations, sweating). Absence of such symptoms makes this less likely.  

4. **Oral contraceptive use**  
   - Patient denies medication use, ruling this out.  

5. **Chronic corticosteroid use**  
   - Similarly excluded by the patient’s denial of medication.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1 (Central fusion of the inferior poles of the kidneys)(肾下极中央融合)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Turner syndrome (supported by webbed neck, short stature, amenorrhea) is strongly associated with renal anomalies like horseshoe kidney.  
  - Renal fusion can lead to hypertension via vascular compression or renal hypoperfusion.  
  - Other options lack clinical or historical support (e.g., no medication use, absence of episodic symptoms).
