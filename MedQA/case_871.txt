Case_description: 
A 45-year-old man presents to your office with a 2-year history of moderate-to-severe pelvic pain, irritative voiding urinary symptoms (frequency and dysuria), and occasional frank blood in his semen with painful ejaculation. He has been evaluated by several practitioners, who have all prescribed antimicrobial therapy, including ciprofloxacin, with no improvement and leading to emotional distress and sleep disturbances. The physical examination is unremarkable, except for a mildly tender prostate, without masses or nodules. There are no testicular masses, hernias, or hemorrhoids. Additionally to this health issue, you have also been following him for recurrent abdominal pain, periods of constipation and diarrhea, and fatigability, with all test results within the normal range thus far. A summary of recent tests is shown in the following table:
Urine test
Sample White cells Culture
Mid-stream urine Negative Negative
Expressed prostatic secretion Positive Negative

GPT's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** 45-year-old male  
- **Chief Complaint:**  
  - 2-year history of moderate-to-severe pelvic pain  
  - Irritative voiding symptoms: urinary frequency and dysuria  
  - Occasional frank blood in semen with painful ejaculation  
- **Additional History:**  
  - Recurrent abdominal pain with periods of constipation and diarrhea  
  - Fatigability  
  - Emotional distress and sleep disturbances due to chronic symptoms  
- **Physical Examination:**  
  - Mildly tender prostate without masses or nodules  
  - No testicular masses, hernias, or hemorrhoids  
- **Recent Test Results:**  
  - **Mid-stream Urine:** White cells negative, culture negative  
  - **Expressed Prostatic Secretion:** White cells positive, culture negative  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Pelvic Pain and Urinary Symptoms:** Chronic pelvic pain and irritative urinary symptoms suggest a prostatic or urinary tract etiology.  
- **Hematospermia and Painful Ejaculation:** These symptoms are often associated with prostatitis or other prostatic disorders.  
- **Lack of Response to Antimicrobial Therapy:** Indicates that the condition may not be due to a typical bacterial infection or may involve antibiotic-resistant organisms.  
- **Expressed Prostatic Secretion Findings:** Presence of white cells indicates inflammation, while negative culture suggests non-bacterial or difficult-to-culture organisms.  
- **Associated Gastrointestinal Symptoms:** Recurrent abdominal pain with constipation and diarrhea may suggest a systemic condition such as a chronic inflammatory disorder or a condition like irritable bowel syndrome, which can co-occur with chronic prostatitis.  
- **Physical Exam:** Mildly tender prostate supports prostatic inflammation without evidence of malignancy or benign prostatic hyperplasia, which typically presents differently.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH):**  
   - **Likelihood:** Low  
   - **Rationale:** BPH typically presents with lower urinary tract symptoms such as weak stream, hesitancy, and nocturia. It is uncommon in a 45-year-old and does not explain pelvic pain, hematuria in semen, or positive white cells in prostatic secretions.

2. **Chronic, Non-Bacterial Prostatitis:**  
   - **Likelihood:** High  
   - **Rationale:** Also known as Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CPPS), it is characterized by chronic pelvic pain, urinary symptoms, and sexual dysfunction without identifiable bacterial infection. The presence of white cells in prostatic secretions supports inflammation without bacterial growth, aligning with non-bacterial prostatitis.

3. **Acute Prostatitis by Chlamydia trachomatis:**  
   - **Likelihood:** Low  
   - **Rationale:** Typically presents acutely with systemic symptoms such as fever and chills, which are absent in this case. Chronic presentation is less common for Chlamydial prostatitis.

4. **Chronic Prostatitis by Resistant Escherichia coli:**  
   - **Likelihood:** Moderate  
   - **Rationale:** While chronic bacterial prostatitis can present with similar symptoms, the negative culture despite antibiotic therapy suggests either non-bacterial etiology or infection with organisms not detected by standard cultures. Resistant E. coli is possible but less likely without evidence of persistent infection.

5. **Interstitial Cystitis:**  
   - **Likelihood:** Low to Moderate  
   - **Rationale:** Presents with pelvic pain and urinary symptoms similar to this case. However, the presence of hematospermia and inflammatory cells in prostatic secretions point more towards a prostatic origin rather than bladder-centric interstitial cystitis.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Chronic, non-bacterial prostatitis)(慢性非细菌性前列腺炎)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 2 (Chronic, non-bacterial prostatitis)

Qwen's full response:

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 45-year-old male with a **2-year history of moderate-to-severe pelvic pain**, **irritative voiding symptoms** (frequency, dysuria), **hematospermia**, and **painful ejaculation**.  
- **Key clinical features**: Persistent symptoms despite antimicrobial therapy (ciprofloxacin), **negative urine cultures**, and **positive leukocytes in expressed prostatic secretions (EPS)**.  
- **Decisive findings**: Chronicity of symptoms, lack of response to antibiotics, and EPS showing inflammation (leukocytes) without bacterial growth.  

---

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline**: Symptoms have persisted for **2 years**, indicating a chronic condition.  
- **Symptom characteristics**:  
  - **Pelvic pain**: Location and chronicity suggest prostatitis rather than acute infection.  
  - **Urinary symptoms**: Frequency and dysuria are classic in prostatitis but can also occur in interstitial cystitis.  
  - **Hematospermia and painful ejaculation**: Strongly implicate prostatic involvement.  
- **Labs**:  
  - **Mid-stream urine**: Negative for WBCs and culture → excludes active UTI.  
  - **EPS**: Positive WBCs (inflammatory marker) but negative culture → supports non-infectious inflammation.  
- **Physical exam**: Mild prostate tenderness without masses or hernias → no evidence of BPH or malignancy.  

---

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)**:  
   - **Unlikely**. BPH primarily causes **obstructive symptoms** (weak stream, hesitancy) rather than pain or hematospermia. EPS WBCs are absent in BPH.  

2. **Chronic, non-bacterial prostatitis (Option 2)**:  
   - **Most likely**. Chronic pelvic pain, urinary symptoms, and EPS leukocytosis without infection align with this diagnosis. Antibiotic failure is expected in non-bacterial cases.  

3. **Acute prostatitis by Chlamydia trachomatis (Option 3)**:  
   - **Unlikely**. Acute prostatitis presents with **sudden onset**, fever, and systemic symptoms. Chlamydia cultures would likely grow in EPS if present, but cultures are negative here.  

4. **Chronic prostatitis by resistant E. coli (Option 4)**:  
   - **Unlikely**. Chronic bacterial prostatitis requires **positive cultures** in ≥2 of 3 samples (midstream urine, catheterized urine, EPS). All cultures here are negative.  

5. **Interstitial cystitis (Option 5)**:  
   - **Less likely**. While it causes pelvic pain and dysuria, hematospermia and EPS abnormalities are atypical.  

---

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Chronic, non-bacterial prostatitis) (慢性非细菌性前列腺炎)**  

**Key evidence**:  
- Chronic symptoms persisting >3 months.  
- EPS shows leukocytosis (inflammation) but no bacterial growth.  
- Lack of response to antibiotics (ciprofloxacin).  
- Negative urine cultures exclude UTI.  
- Clinical features align with NIH category III prostatitis (chronic pelvic pain syndrome), the most common form of non-bacterial prostatitis.

DeepSeek is reasoning the answer...

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 2 (Chronic, non-bacterial prostatitis)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 45-year-old man.  
- **Chief Complaint**: 2-year history of moderate-to-severe pelvic pain, irritative voiding symptoms (frequency, dysuria), and occasional hematospermia with painful ejaculation.  
- **Additional Symptoms**: Recurrent abdominal pain, alternating constipation/diarrhea, fatigue.  
- **Key Findings**:  
  - Expressed prostatic secretions (EPS) show **white cells (positive)** but **negative culture**.  
  - Mid-stream urine is normal.  
  - Physical exam: Mildly tender prostate, no masses/nodules.  
  - Failed antimicrobial therapy (ciprofloxacin) and associated psychological distress.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Chronic Pelvic Pain**: Persistent for 2 years, localized to the prostate (tender on exam), with hematospermia and painful ejaculation. These are hallmark features of **prostatitis**, particularly chronic forms.  
- **Urinary Symptoms**: Irritative voiding (frequency, dysuria) aligns with prostatic inflammation but lacks obstructive features (e.g., weak stream), arguing against BPH.  
- **Negative Cultures**: EPS shows inflammation (leukocytes) but **no bacterial growth**, ruling out bacterial prostatitis (acute or chronic).  
- **Failed Antibiotics**: Lack of improvement with ciprofloxacin (which covers Chlamydia and typical uropathogens) opposes bacterial etiologies.  
- **Functional GI Symptoms**: Recurrent abdominal pain and bowel irregularities suggest a possible systemic pain syndrome (e.g., IBS), often comorbid with chronic non-bacterial prostatitis.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)**:  
   - Unlikely. BPH causes obstructive urinary symptoms (e.g., hesitancy, weak stream) and lacks pelvic pain, hematospermia, or prostatic inflammation.  
2. **Chronic Non-Bacterial Prostatitis (CNBP)**  
   - **Strongly Supported**. Matches chronic pelvic pain, tender prostate, inflammatory EPS, negative cultures, and antibiotic failure. Associated GI symptoms suggest a functional pain disorder.  
3. **Acute Prostatitis by Chlamydia trachomatis**  
   - Unlikely. Acute prostatitis presents with fever, severe pain, and systemic symptoms. Chlamydia would typically respond to ciprofloxacin.  
4. **Chronic Prostatitis by Resistant E. coli**  
   - Unlikely. Negative EPS culture excludes persistent bacterial infection. Resistance to ciprofloxacin would not explain sterile inflammation.  
5. **Interstitial Cystitis (IC)**  
   - Unlikely. IC causes bladder pain (suprapubic) and urinary urgency/frequency but not hematospermia or prostatic tenderness.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Chronic, non-bacterial prostatitis)(慢性非细菌性前列腺炎)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  1. Chronic pelvic pain (>3 months) with prostatic tenderness.  
  2. Inflammatory EPS (leukocytes) but negative cultures, excluding bacterial causes.  
  3. Failure of antimicrobial therapy.  
  4. Coexisting functional GI symptoms, aligning with a systemic chronic pain syndrome (e.g., CPPS).
