Case_description: 
A 5-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of facial swelling that started 5 days ago. Two weeks ago, he had a sore throat that resolved spontaneously. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 107/min, and blood pressure is 94/67 mm Hg. Examination shows pitting edema of the upper and lower extremities as well as periorbital edema. The abdomen is mildly distended. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 13.1 g/dL
Serum
Albumin 2.1 g/dL
Total cholesterol 270 mg/dL
Triglycerides 175 mg/dL
Urine
Blood negative
Glucose negative

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** A 5-year-old boy.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Facial swelling for the past 5 days.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - Pitting edema of both upper and lower extremities.  
  - Periorbital edema.  
  - Mild abdominal distension.  
- **Recent Medical History:** Sore throat two weeks prior, which resolved spontaneously.  
- **Vital Signs:** Temperature 37°C, pulse 107/min, blood pressure 94/67 mm Hg.  
- **Laboratory Findings:**  
  - **Serum:** Albumin 2.1 g/dL (low), Total cholesterol 270 mg/dL (elevated), Triglycerides 175 mg/dL (elevated).  
  - **Urine:** Protein 4+ (significant proteinuria), negative for blood and glucose, leukocyte esterase negative.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
The patient presents with classic signs of nephrotic syndrome, characterized by significant proteinuria (4+), hypoalbuminemia (albumin 2.1 g/dL), hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol 270 mg/dL), and generalized edema (periorbital and peripheral). The absence of hematuria and leukocyte esterase reduces the likelihood of acute post-infectious glomerulonephritis, especially given the prior sore throat. Nephrotic syndrome in children is most commonly due to minimal change disease (MCD), which is typically responsive to corticosteroids and presents with the described clinical and laboratory findings.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1:** *Mesangial proliferation on light microscopy*  
  - **Analysis:** Commonly associated with IgA nephropathy or other forms of glomerulonephritis, not typically seen in minimal change disease. Less likely given the absence of hematuria.

- **Option 2:** *Subepithelial dense deposits on electron microscopy*  
  - **Analysis:** Indicative of membranous nephropathy, which is rare in pediatric populations and inconsistent with the patient's presentation.

- **Option 3:** *Deposits of IgG and C3 at the glomerular basement membrane on immunofluorescence*  
  - **Analysis:** Suggestive of membranous nephropathy or certain immune complex-mediated diseases, which are uncommon in this clinical scenario.

- **Option 4:** *Normal light microscopy findings*  
  - **Analysis:** Characteristic of minimal change disease, where light microscopy does not reveal significant abnormalities, aligning well with the patient's presentation.

- **Option 5:** *Effacement of foot processes of podocytes on light microscopy*  
  - **Analysis:** Foot process effacement is typically observed under electron microscopy, not light microscopy, in minimal change disease.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Normal light microscopy findings)(光镜检查结果正常)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 4 (Normal light microscopy findings)

Qwen's full response:

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 5-year-old boy presents with 5-day history of facial and extremity edema, following a resolved sore throat 2 weeks prior.  
- Key symptoms: Periorbital and pitting edema, mild abdominal distension, normotensive (94/67 mmHg).  
- Laboratory findings: Hypoalbuminemia (2.1 g/dL), hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol 270 mg/dL, triglycerides 175 mg/dL), and massive proteinuria (4+). Urinalysis shows no blood, glucose, or leukocyte esterase.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Nephrotic Syndrome**: The combination of edema, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia, and nephrotic-range proteinuria (4+) strongly suggests nephrotic syndrome.  
- **Post-infectious trigger**: The preceding sore throat raises suspicion for post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN). However, PSGN typically presents with hematuria, hypertension, and acute kidney injury, which are absent here.  
- **Timing**: The edema started 5 days after the sore throat resolved, fitting the 1-2 week delay typical of PSGN. However, the absence of hematuria and normal blood pressure make PSGN less likely.  
- **Differential Diagnosis**: Minimal change disease (MCD) is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children. Immune complex-mediated GN (e.g., PSGN) is less likely due to the lack of hematuria.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (Mesangial proliferation)**: Seen in IgA nephropathy or mesangial proliferative GN. These conditions typically present with hematuria, which is absent here. Unlikely.  
- **Option 2 (Subepithelial dense deposits)**: Characteristic of membranous nephropathy, which is rare in children and does not align with the clinical presentation. Unlikely.  
- **Option 3 (IgG/C3 deposits at GBM)**: Suggests immune complex-mediated GN (e.g., PSGN). While the history of infection supports this, the absence of hematuria and normotension reduce its likelihood.  
- **Option 4 (Normal light microscopy)**: Consistent with minimal change disease (MCD), the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children. Light microscopy is typically normal in MCD, with foot process effacement seen on electron microscopy.  
- **Option 5 (Foot process effacement on light microscopy)**: Incorrect; effacement of podocyte foot processes is a finding on electron microscopy, not light microscopy. This is a technical error.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Normal light microscopy findings)(光镜下正常发现)**  

**Key Evidence**:  
- The patient’s presentation (nephrotic syndrome without hematuria/hypertension) strongly favors **minimal change disease (MCD)**, the most common cause of primary nephrotic syndrome in children.  
- Light microscopy in MCD is typically **normal**, with characteristic effacement of podocyte foot processes observed only on **electron microscopy** (not listed as an option here).  
- The lack of hematuria and normotension make immune complex-mediated GN (e.g., PSGN) less likely, despite the recent infection.

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 5-year-old boy with facial swelling (5-day duration), preceded by a resolved sore throat 2 weeks prior.  
- **Key Findings**:  
  - **Clinical**: Periorbital edema, pitting edema of extremities, mild abdominal distension.  
  - **Laboratory**: Severe hypoalbuminemia (2.1 g/dL), hypercholesterolemia (270 mg/dL), nephrotic-range proteinuria (4+), no hematuria or leukocyturia.  
- **Decisive Features**: Nephrotic syndrome triad (proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, edema) with antecedent streptococcal infection.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline**: Sore throat (2 weeks ago) → Resolution → Onset of edema (5 days ago).  
- **Proteinuria and Hypoalbuminemia**: Indicate glomerular pathology, specifically podocyte dysfunction.  
- **Absence of Hematuria/Hypertension**: Rules out nephritic syndromes (e.g., post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis).  
- **Hyperlipidemia**: Secondary to nephrotic syndrome.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (Mesangial proliferation on LM)**: Seen in IgA nephropathy or proliferative glomerulonephritis. Unlikely here due to lack of hematuria/nephritic features.  
- **Option 2 (Subepithelial dense deposits on EM)**: Characteristic of membranous nephropathy (rare in children) or post-infectious GN. Lacks supporting evidence (e.g., IgG/C3 deposits in this case).  
- **Option 3 (IgG/C3 at GBM)**: Suggests membranous nephropathy or immune-complex GN. Minimal change disease (MCD) typically has negative immunofluorescence.  
- **Option 4 (Normal LM)**: Classic for MCD, the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children. Aligns with clinical presentation.  
- **Option 5 (Effacement on LM)**: Incorrect; foot process effacement is visible only on electron microscopy, not light microscopy.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Normal light microscopy findings)(光顕所見で正常)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Nephrotic syndrome in a young child strongly favors minimal change disease (MCD).  
  - MCD biopsy findings include normal light microscopy, foot process effacement on EM (not listed), and no immune deposits.  
  - Absence of hematuria/hypertension and normal complement levels exclude nephritic etiologies.
