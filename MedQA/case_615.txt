**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** 31-year-old male hospitalized for substance-induced psychosis.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Episodic neck stiffness and pain lasting approximately 25 minutes over the past 8 hours.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - Neck rotates to the right during episodes.  
  - Last episode relieved by lightly touching the jaw.  
  - Currently appears anxious.  
  - Vital signs: Temperature 37.3°C, pulse 108/min, blood pressure 128/86 mm Hg.  
  - Physical examination: Flexed neck rotated to the right with rigidity and limited range of motion.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
The patient presents with acute episodes of neck stiffness and abnormal posture (torticollis) following the administration of haloperidol, an antipsychotic medication. The temporal relationship (symptoms onset within two days of hospitalization and after multiple doses of haloperidol) strongly suggests an extrapyramidal side effect, specifically an acute dystonic reaction. The ability to relieve symptoms by touching the jaw indicates a response typical of dystonic spasms. Vital signs show slight tachycardia and marginally elevated temperature, which are non-specific but do not meet the criteria for more severe conditions like neuroleptic malignant syndrome.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Benztropine**  
  - **Relevance:** Benztropine is an anticholinergic agent commonly used to treat acute dystonic reactions caused by antipsychotic medications.  
  - **Alignment:** Directly addresses the likely diagnosis of an acute dystonic reaction.  
- **Option 2: Physical Therapy**  
  - **Relevance:** May help with musculoskeletal discomfort but is not first-line for acute dystonic reactions.  
  - **Alignment:** Does not address the underlying neurochemical imbalance.  
- **Option 3: Dantrolene**  
  - **Relevance:** Used primarily for neuroleptic malignant syndrome and malignant hyperthermia.  
  - **Alignment:** The patient does not exhibit signs of these conditions.  
- **Option 4: Baclofen**  
  - **Relevance:** A muscle relaxant used for spasticity.  
  - **Alignment:** Not specific for acute dystonic reactions.  
- **Option 5: Propranolol**  
  - **Relevance:** A beta-blocker used for conditions like akathisia or tremors.  
  - **Alignment:** Does not address acute dystonic reactions.

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 1 (Benztropine)

Qwen's full response:

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 31-year-old man with a history of substance-induced psychosis recently admitted to the hospital.  
- Chief complaint: Episodic neck stiffness and pain over 8 hours, lasting ~25 minutes per episode, with spontaneous resolution by touching his jaw.  
- Key clinical manifestations:  
  - Neck stiffness, rotation to the right, and limited range of motion.  
  - Episodic symptoms with self-relief via a "geste antagoniste" (touching the jaw).  
  - Elevated pulse (108/min), blood pressure (128/86 mm Hg), and slight fever (37.3°C).  
  - Anxiety and recent haloperidol use (6 doses).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline and Symptoms**: The onset of neck symptoms coincides with haloperidol administration (used for auditory hallucinations), suggesting a drug-induced etiology. The episodic nature, self-limiting episodes, and geste antagoniste are hallmark features of dystonic reactions.  
- **Neurological Signs**: Torticollis (neck rotation to the right) and neck rigidity align with acute dystonia. The absence of fever, rash, or meningeal signs (e.g., photophobia, Kernig/Brudzinski signs) makes meningitis or encephalitis unlikely.  
- **Drug History**: Haloperidol is a dopamine receptor antagonist known to cause extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), particularly acute dystonia, especially in younger patients. The timing of symptom onset (days after initiation) is consistent with this mechanism.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Benztropine (抗胆碱能药物)**  
  - **Support**: Acute dystonia is a recognized side effect of haloperidol. Benztropine, an anticholinergic, is first-line therapy for dystonic reactions by counteracting dopamine blockade.  
  - **Alignment**: Symptoms (episodic dystonia, geste antagoniste, recent antipsychotic use) strongly support this choice.  

- **Option 2: Physical Therapy (物理治疗)**  
  - **Opposition**: Physical therapy is ineffective for acute drug-induced dystonia. It may help chronic spasticity but not acute EPS.  

- **Option 3: Dantrolene (丹曲林)**  
  - **Opposition**: Dantrollene is used for severe muscle rigidity (e.g., malignant hyperthermia) and is not indicated for dystonia.  

- **Option 4: Baclofen (巴氯芬)**  
  - **Opposition**: Baclofen is a GABA-B agonist for spasticity (e.g., in multiple sclerosis). It does not address dystonic contractions caused by dopamine antagonism.  

- **Option 5: Propranolol (普萘洛尔)**  
  - **Opposition**: Propranolol is a beta-blocker used for tremors or anxiety but lacks efficacy for dystonia.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1 Benztropine (抗胆碱能药物)**  

**Key Evidence**:  
- The patient’s symptoms (episodic neck dystonia, geste antagoniste) and recent haloperidol use strongly suggest acute dystonia, a well-documented side effect of antipsychotics.  
- Benztropine directly antagonizes acetylcholine receptors, counteracting dopamine blockade and resolving dystonic symptoms. Other options are either ineffective or address unrelated pathologies.

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 31-year-old man hospitalized for substance-induced psychosis.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Episodic neck stiffness, pain, and rightward neck rotation lasting ~25 minutes over 8 hours.  
- **Key Symptoms/Signs**:  
  - Intermittent cervical dystonia (neck stiffness, rotation to the right, rigidity, limited range of motion).  
  - Symptom relief with sensory trick (touching jaw).  
  - Recent administration of **haloperidol** (6 doses) for psychosis.  
  - Anxiety, mild tachycardia (pulse 108/min), low-grade fever (37.3°C).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline**: Symptoms began after repeated haloperidol doses (dopamine D2 receptor antagonist), strongly implicating **drug-induced acute dystonia**.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - **Cervical dystonia**: Episodic neck stiffness, rotation, rigidity, and sensory trick response are pathognomonic for dystonia.  
  - **Medication Link**: Haloperidol is a high-risk agent for extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), including acute dystonia, which typically occurs within hours to days of initiation.  
  - **Autonomic Signs**: Mild tachycardia and anxiety may reflect discomfort or autonomic involvement in dystonia.  
- **Contraindications for Other Diagnoses**:  
  - **Meningitis**: No severe fever, headache, or meningismus.  
  - **Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)**: Absent hyperthermia (>38°C), severe rigidity, or altered consciousness.  
  - **Tetanus**: No trismus, spasms, or wound history.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Benztropine (抗胆碱能药物)**:  
   - First-line for **acute dystonia** caused by antipsychotics. Anticholinergics rapidly relieve dystonic spasms by correcting dopamine-acetylcholine imbalance in the basal ganglia.  
   - **Alignment**: Perfectly matches the clinical scenario (haloperidol use + dystonic features).  
2. **Physical Therapy (物理治疗)**:  
   - Useful for chronic dystonia or musculoskeletal issues but ineffective for acute drug-induced dystonia.  
3. **Dantrolene (丹曲林)**:  
   - Indicated for NMS or malignant hyperthermia, neither of which is supported here (lack of severe hyperthermia/autonomic instability).  
4. **Baclofen (巴氯芬)**:  
   - GABA agonist for spasticity (e.g., cerebral palsy, spinal cord injury), not acute dystonia.  
5. **Propranolol (普萘洛尔)**:  
   - Beta-blocker for akathisia or tremor but ineffective for dystonia.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1 (Benztropine)(抗胆碱能药物)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  1. Acute cervical dystonia temporally linked to haloperidol, a known trigger.  
  2. Sensory trick (geste antagoniste) and episodic nature confirm dystonia.  
  3. Anticholinergics (e.g., benztropine) are guideline-recommended for rapid resolution of antipsychotic-induced dystonia.  
  4. Other options lack mechanistic relevance to the pathophysiology.
