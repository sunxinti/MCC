Case_id: case_116
Case_description: 
A 16-year-old boy with a seizure disorder and cognitive delay is brought to the physician because of progressively worsening right lower extremity weakness for the past 6 months. He does not make eye contact and sits very close to his mother. Physical examination shows a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the cardiac apex. Neurological examination shows decreased strength in the right lower leg with normal strength in the other extremities. Fundoscopic examination shows several multinodular, calcified lesions in the retina bilaterally. A photograph of his skin findings is shown. This patient's condition is most likely due to a mutation in which of the following?
Options: 
1. NF1 gene on chromosome 17
2. NF2 gene on chromosome 22
3. GNAQ gene on chromosome 9
4. TSC1 gene on chromosome 9
5. VHL gene on chromosome 3
Correct Answer: TSC1 gene on chromosome 9

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** 16-year-old male with a history of seizure disorder and cognitive delay.
- **Chief Complaint:** Progressively worsening right lower extremity weakness over the past 6 months.
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**
  - Behavioral: Does not make eye contact, prefers to sit close to his mother (suggestive of autism spectrum behaviors).
  - Cardiovascular: Grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the cardiac apex.
  - Neurological: Decreased strength specifically in the right lower leg; other extremities maintain normal strength.
  - Ophthalmological: Bilateral multinodular, calcified retinal lesions observed on fundoscopic examination.
  - Dermatological: Specific skin findings (details implied by the photograph).

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Seizure Disorder and Cognitive Delay:** Common in neurocutaneous syndromes such as tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and neurofibromatosis (NF).
- **Behavioral Characteristics:** Lack of eye contact and preference for proximity may indicate associated autism spectrum disorder, which is seen in TSC.
- **Cardiac Murmur:** A holosystolic murmur at the cardiac apex raises suspicion for mitral regurgitation or possibly cardiac rhabdomyomas, the latter being associated with TSC.
- **Neurological Findings:** Focal weakness in the right lower extremity suggests a localized neurological lesion, possibly a focal cortical tuber in TSC.
- **Ophthalmological Findings:** Multinodular, calcified retinal lesions are consistent with retinal hamartomas seen in TSC.
- **Skin Findings:** Although the photograph is not visible, TSC is characterized by facial angiofibromas, hypomelanotic macules, and shagreen patches, which are likely depicted.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: NF1 gene on chromosome 17**
  - **Likelihood:** NF1 features include cafe-au-lait spots, neurofibromas, and Lisch nodules, but not typically retinal hamartomas or cardiac rhabdomyomas.
  - **Alignment:** Less consistent with the patient's presentation.
- **Option 2: NF2 gene on chromosome 22**
  - **Likelihood:** NF2 is characterized by bilateral vestibular schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas.
  - **Alignment:** Does not align well with the patient's retinal findings and cardiac murmur.
- **Option 3: GNAQ gene on chromosome 9**
  - **Likelihood:** Associated with Sturge-Weber syndrome, which includes facial port-wine stains and leptomeningeal angiomas.
  - **Alignment:** Lacks matching features such as facial capillary malformation.
- **Option 4: TSC1 gene on chromosome 9**
  - **Likelihood:** TSC presents with seizures, cognitive impairment, retinal hamartomas, cardiac rhabdomyomas, and specific skin lesions.
  - **Alignment:** Highly consistent with all clinical manifestations observed in the patient.
- **Option 5: VHL gene on chromosome 3**
  - **Likelihood:** VHL is linked to hemangioblastomas, renal cell carcinoma, and pheochromocytomas.
  - **Alignment:** Does not correspond with the patient's neurocutaneous and cardiac features.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (TSC1 gene on chromosome 9)(TSC1基因位于第9染色体上)**

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 16-year-old boy with a history of seizure disorder and cognitive delay.  
- **Chief Complaint**: Progressively worsening right lower extremity weakness over 6 months.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations**:  
  - **Neurological**: Cognitive delay, decreased strength in the right lower leg.  
  - **Cardiac**: Grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the cardiac apex.  
  - **Ocular**: Bilateral multinodular, calcified retinal lesions.  
  - **Behavioral**: Avoids eye contact, clings to mother.  
  - **Skin Findings**: Implied by the photograph (not shown, but critical for neurocutaneous syndromes).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Neurodevelopmental and Neurological Features**: Seizures, cognitive delay, and focal weakness suggest a neurocutaneous disorder affecting the CNS. Right lower extremity weakness localizes to left motor cortex dysfunction, possibly due to cortical tubers.  
- **Cardiac Murmur**: Holosystolic murmur at the apex may indicate mitral regurgitation, which in neurocutaneous disorders is most associated with cardiac rhabdomyomas (common in TSC, though typically regress by adolescence).  
- **Retinal Lesions**: Multinodular, calcified lesions align with **astrocytic hamartomas**, pathognomonic for Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC).  
- **Skin Findings**: Likely hypomelanotic macules, facial angiofibromas, or shagreen patches (classic TSC features).  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (NF1 gene)**: NF1 causes café-au-lait spots, neurofibromas, and Lisch nodules (iris hamartomas). Retinal lesions in NF1 are uncommon and not calcified. Cognitive delay is milder. **Unlikely**.  
- **Option 2 (NF2 gene)**: NF2 is characterized by vestibular schwannomas and meningiomas. Retinal abnormalities are rare, and seizures/cognitive delay are atypical. **Excluded**.  
- **Option 3 (GNAQ gene)**: Sturge-Weber syndrome presents with port-wine stains, leptomeningeal angiomas, and "tram-track" cortical calcifications. Retinal lesions here are inconsistent. **Excluded**.  
- **Option 4 (TSC1 gene)**: TSC features include seizures, cognitive delay, cortical tubers, retinal astrocytic hamartomas (multinodular/calcified), cardiac rhabdomyomas, and skin lesions (e.g., angiofibromas). All findings align perfectly. **Strongly Supported**.  
- **Option 5 (VHL gene)**: VHL causes retinal hemangioblastomas (vascular, not calcified) and CNS tumors. Seizures and cognitive delay are atypical. **Excluded**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (TSC1 gene on chromosome 9)(染色体9上的TSC1基因)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  1. **Retinal astrocytic hamartomas** (calcified, multinodular) are pathognomonic for TSC.  
  2. **Seizures and cognitive delay** are hallmark neurological manifestations of TSC.  
  3. **Cardiac murmur** may reflect residual cardiac rhabdomyomas (common in TSC).  
  4. **Skin findings** (inferred) likely include TSC-specific lesions (e.g., hypomelanotic macules, angiofibromas).  
  5. **Focal weakness** correlates with cortical tubers affecting motor pathways.
