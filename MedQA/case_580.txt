Case_description: 
A 20-year-old woman is brought in for a psychiatric consultation by her mother who is concerned because of her daughter’s recent bizarre behavior. The patient’s father died from lung cancer 1 week ago. Though this has been stressful for the whole family, the daughter has been hearing voices and having intrusive thoughts ever since. These voices have conversations about her and how she should have been the one to die and they encourage her to kill herself. She has not been able to concentrate at work or at school. She has no other history of medical or psychiatric illness. She denies recent use of any medication. Today, her heart rate is 90/min, respiratory rate is 17/min, blood pressure is 110/65 mm Hg, and temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F). On physical exam, she appears gaunt and anxious. Her heart has a regular rate and rhythm and her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. CMP, CBC, and TSH are normal. A urine toxicology test is negative. What is the patient’s most likely diagnosis?
Options: 
1. Brief psychotic disorder
2. Schizophreniform
3. Adjustment disorder
4. Schizophrenia
5. Bereavement

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** A 20-year-old woman.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Recent bizarre behavior following her father's death from lung cancer one week ago.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - Auditory hallucinations: Hearing voices engaging in conversations about her and urging her to kill herself.  
  - Intrusive thoughts related to her own death.  
  - Functional impairment: Inability to concentrate at work and school.  
  - No prior history of medical or psychiatric illness.  
  - Denies use of any medication; urine toxicology negative.  
  - Physical exam: Gaunt, anxious appearance; vital signs within normal limits.  
  - Laboratory Tests: Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), complete blood count (CBC), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) normal.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline:** The onset of symptoms began within one week following a significant stressor—the death of her father.  
- **Characteristics:** The patient exhibits acute psychotic symptoms, including auditory hallucinations with themes of self-blame and suicidal ideation. These symptoms have led to noticeable functional decline in her academic and work environments.  
- **Interrelationships:** The close temporal relationship between her father's death and the emergence of psychotic symptoms suggests a stress-related etiology. The absence of prior psychiatric history and the acute onset are critical in narrowing down the diagnosis.  
- **Supporting Features:**  
  - Acute onset of psychotic symptoms following a severe stressor.  
  - Functional impairment directly impacting daily activities.  
- **Counteracting Features:**  
  - Lack of chronicity and absence of prior psychiatric episodes argue against chronic psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Brief Psychotic Disorder:**  
   - **Alignment:** Characterized by the sudden onset of psychotic symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, delusions) lasting more than one day but less than one month, often in response to a significant stressor.  
   - **Support:** The patient's symptoms began within one week of her father's death, fitting the temporal criteria.  
   
2. **Schizophreniform Disorder:**  
   - **Alignment:** Similar to schizophrenia but with a duration of symptoms between one and six months.  
   - **Opposition:** The patient's symptoms have been present for only one week, which is too short for this diagnosis.  
   
3. **Adjustment Disorder:**  
   - **Alignment:** Emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable stressor occurring within three months of the stressor.  
   - **Opposition:** While the timeframe fits, the presence of psychotic symptoms is not typical for adjustment disorders, which usually involve anxiety or depressive symptoms without psychosis.  
   
4. **Schizophrenia:**  
   - **Alignment:** Characterized by at least six months of disturbance, including at least one month of active-phase symptoms such as delusions or hallucinations.  
   - **Opposition:** The duration of symptoms is far too short to meet the criteria for schizophrenia.  
   
5. **Bereavement:**  
   - **Alignment:** Natural reaction to loss, potentially including a wide range of emotional and some mild psychological symptoms.  
   - **Opposition:** While intense grief can lead to various psychological symptoms, the presence of full-blown psychosis (auditory hallucinations with specific delusional content) is atypical and suggests an alternative or concurrent psychiatric disorder.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1 (Brief psychotic disorder)(短暂型精神病性障碍)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 1 (Brief psychotic disorder)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 20-year-old woman presents with auditory hallucinations, intrusive thoughts (e.g., voices commenting on her and encouraging suicide), and impaired concentration since her father’s death one week ago.  
- Key symptoms include:  
  - **Auditory hallucinations** (voices discussing her and suggesting she "should have died").  
  - **Delusional thoughts** (voices encouraging self-harm).  
  - Marked functional impairment (work/school difficulties).  
  - Acute onset following a significant stressor (bereavement).  
- No medical, psychiatric, or substance use history. Normal physical exam and lab results.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline**: Symptoms began **immediately** after the death of her father (a severe stressor) and have persisted for **one week**.  
- **Symptom Characteristics**:  
  - **Psychotic features** (hallucinations and delusions) are central.  
  - The content of the hallucinations (suicidal ideation and self-blame) is contextually linked to the stressor (bereavement).  
  - No evidence of mood congruence (e.g., depressive or manic symptoms).  
- **Exclusion of Medical Causes**: Normal labs (CMP, CBC, TSH), negative urine toxicology, and no medication use rule out organic or substance-induced causes.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Brief Psychotic Disorder**:  
   - **Support**: Acute onset (<1 month), clear stressor (bereavement), and presence of psychotic symptoms. Duration of 1 week fits the 1-day–1-month criterion.  
   - **Opposition**: None; aligns perfectly.  

2. **Schizophreniform**:  
   - **Support**: Psychotic symptoms and functional impairment.  
   - **Opposition**: Requires **≥1 month** of symptoms for diagnosis. The patient’s symptoms have only persisted for 1 week, so this is premature.  

3. **Adjustment Disorder**:  
   - **Support**: Acute stressor (bereavement).  
   - **Opposition**: Adjustment disorder **cannot include psychotic features** (DSM-5 criteria). The hallucinations and delusions necessitate a psychotic disorder.  

4. **Schizophrenia**:  
   - **Support**: Psychotic symptoms.  
   - **Opposition**: Onset must be **insidious or gradual**, not stress-induced. Schizophrenia also lacks the time-limited nature of the current presentation.  

5. **Bereavement**:  
   - **Support**: Recent loss of a loved one.  
   - **Opposition**: Bereavement is a normal grief reaction and **does not explain psychotic symptoms**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1 (Brief psychotic disorder)(短暂性精神病性障碍)**  

**Key Evidence Supporting Choice**:  
- The patient’s symptoms (auditory hallucinations, delusions) developed **within days of a severe stressor** (bereavement) and have persisted for **<1 month**, fulfilling the criteria for brief psychotic disorder.  
- Other options are inconsistent: Schizophreniform requires ≥1 month, adjustment disorder excludes psychosis, schizophrenia lacks stressor link, and bereavement alone cannot explain psychosis.

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 1 (Brief psychotic disorder)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Profile**: 20-year-old woman with no prior psychiatric history, presenting with acute-onset psychotic symptoms following her father’s death 1 week ago.  
- **Key Symptoms**:  
  - **Psychotic features**: Auditory hallucinations (voices discussing her and urging suicide), intrusive thoughts.  
  - **Functional impairment**: Difficulty concentrating at work/school.  
  - **Anxiety and physical signs**: Gaunt appearance, anxious affect.  
- **Normal labs and exams**: No medical or substance-induced cause identified.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline**: Symptoms emerged abruptly after a severe stressor (father’s death), lasting <1 week.  
- **Psychotic symptoms**: Hallucinations and delusional content (suicidal ideation) are prominent, consistent with psychosis.  
- **Stress-triggered onset**: The temporal link to trauma supports a stress-related psychotic disorder.  
- **Contraindications**:  
  - **Schizophrenia/Schizophreniform**: Symptoms <1 month, no prior history.  
  - **Adjustment disorder**: Lacks typical mood/behavioral symptoms; psychosis is atypical.  
  - **Bereavement**: Normal grief does not explain psychosis.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Brief Psychotic Disorder**:  
   - **Alignment**: Acute psychosis (<1 month) triggered by stress, no prior history. DSM-5 criteria met (hallucinations, impaired functioning).  
   - **Strength**: Best fits timeline and clinical presentation.  
2. **Schizophreniform**:  
   - **Contraindication**: Requires ≥1 month of symptoms; duration here is too short.  
3. **Adjustment Disorder**:  
   - **Contraindication**: Psychosis is not a feature of adjustment disorder.  
4. **Schizophrenia**:  
   - **Contraindication**: Requires ≥6 months of symptoms, including prodromal/residual phases.  
5. **Bereavement**:  
   - **Contraindication**: Severe psychosis exceeds normal grief reactions.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1 (Brief psychotic disorder)(短暂性精神病性障碍)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Acute onset of hallucinations and delusions within 1 week of a major stressor.  
  - Symptoms meet DSM-5 criteria for Brief Psychotic Disorder (duration <1 month, no prior history, exclusion of other causes).  
  - Normal labs/toxicology and absence of chronicity rule out schizophrenia-spectrum disorders.
