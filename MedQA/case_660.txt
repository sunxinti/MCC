Case_description: 
A 35-year-old man presents with a 7 month history of insomnia. The patient admitted to having trouble sleeping from a young age but became more aware of how much this is affecting his health after attending a sleep conference earlier this year. He is worried that his health has suffered because of this, and he is also concerned that he will not be able to pay his bills if he were to get sick. He has no past medical or psychiatric condition and is not known to use any recreational drugs. The patient arrived for his appointment an hour early because he was afraid he might miss it. The patient is afebrile and his vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals an irritable middle age man who is tense and somewhat inattentive during the interview. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
 
Options: 
1. Generalized anxiety disorder
2. Adjustment disorder
3. Social anxiety 
4. Agoraphobia
5. Normal worry

GPT's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** A 35-year-old man with no past medical or psychiatric history and no recreational drug use.
- **Chief Complaint:** 7-month history of insomnia, which has become more concerning to him after attending a sleep conference.
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - Persistent difficulty sleeping since a young age, exacerbated in the past 7 months.
  - Excessive worry about his health being affected by insomnia and financial stability if he becomes sick.
  - Behavioral changes such as arriving an hour early to his appointment out of fear of missing it.
  - Physical examination reveals an irritable, tense, and somewhat inattentive demeanor.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline:** The patient's insomnia has been present for 7 months, with increased awareness and concern following a sleep conference earlier in the year.
- **Characteristics of Symptoms:**  
  - The insomnia is chronic and has led to significant worry about both health and financial consequences.
  - Behavioral changes (early arrival) indicate heightened anxiety levels.
  - No identifiable precipitating event aside from increased awareness from the conference.
- **Interrelationships:** Chronic insomnia may contribute to or exacerbate anxiety symptoms, creating a cycle that impacts the patient's daily functioning and mental well-being.
- **Diagnostic Considerations:** The persistence of symptoms beyond six months and the presence of excessive worry about multiple aspects of life are notable.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)**  
  - **Alignment:** Fits the criteria of excessive, uncontrollable worry occurring more days than not for at least six months, concerning multiple areas (health and finances).
  - **Support:** Chronic nature of anxiety, physical manifestations (irritability, tension), and behavioral changes.
- **Option 2: Adjustment Disorder**  
  - **Alignment:** Typically related to a specific stressor within three months of onset.
  - **Opposition:** The patient's anxiety is more generalized and chronic, not clearly tied to a single identifiable stressor.
- **Option 3: Social Anxiety**  
  - **Alignment:** Involves fear of social situations.
  - **Opposition:** The patient's fears are related to health and financial issues, not social interactions.
- **Option 4: Agoraphobia**  
  - **Alignment:** Involves fear of situations where escape might be difficult.
  - **Opposition:** No evidence of fear related to open spaces or being unable to escape; the patient's anxiety is more generalized.
- **Option 5: Normal Worry**  
  - **Alignment:** Everyday concerns that do not impair functioning.
  - **Opposition:** The patient's worries are excessive and impacting his behavior and well-being, exceeding what is considered normal.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1 (Generalized anxiety disorder)(广泛性焦虑症)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 1 (Generalized anxiety disorder)

Qwen's full response:

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 35-year-old man presents with a 7-month history of insomnia, which he first recognized as problematic after attending a sleep conference.  
- Key symptoms include chronic insomnia since childhood, excessive worry about health consequences and financial instability, and hypervigilance (arriving an hour early for his appointment due to fear of missing it).  
- Physical examination findings: irritability, tension, and inattentiveness during the interview.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline**: Insomnia has been present since childhood, but anxiety about its health impacts intensified after the sleep conference (within the past year). The 7-month duration aligns with chronic anxiety disorders.  
- **Symptoms**:  
  - Excessive worry about multiple domains (health, finances) is a hallmark of generalized anxiety.  
  - Behavioral manifestation (arriving early to avoid missing appointments) suggests restlessness and hyperarousal.  
  - Physical signs (irritability, tension) support an anxiety disorder.  
- **Exclusion of Other Diagnoses**:  
  - No evidence of specific social anxiety or agoraphobia (no avoidance of social situations or environments).  
  - Adjustment disorder typically arises within 3 months of a stressor (sleep conference), but symptoms here predate this and are chronic.  
  - "Normal worry" is insufficient to explain the severity, duration, and physical manifestations.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **1. Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)**:  
  - **Support**: Chronicity (since childhood), excessive worry across multiple domains (health, finances), physical symptoms (irritability, tension), and restlessness (arriving early).  
  - DSM-5 criteria: Excessive anxiety for ≥6 months, difficulty controlling worry, and associated symptoms like restlessness, fatigue, irritability, muscle tension, or sleep disturbance.  
- **2. Adjustment Disorder**:  
  - **Opposition**: Symptoms predate the stressor (sleep conference) and exceed the 3-month onset window.  
- **3. Social Anxiety**:  
  - **Opposition**: No fear of social evaluation or avoidance of social interactions described.  
- **4. Agoraphobia**:  
  - **Opposition**: No avoidance of specific places or situations due to fear of panic.  
- **5. Normal Worry**:  
  - **Opposition**: Symptoms are severe, persistent, and impairing (e.g., hypervigilance about missing appointments).  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1 (Generalized anxiety disorder)(广泛性焦虑障碍)**  

**Key evidence**:  
- Chronicity (since childhood) and 7-month duration meet GAD criteria.  
- Multiple domains of excessive worry (health, finances) and physical symptoms (irritability, tension).  
- Behavioral manifestations (hypervigilance about punctuality) align with restlessness in GAD.  
- No features supporting adjustment disorder, social anxiety, agoraphobia, or normal worry.

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 1 (Generalized anxiety disorder)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 35-year-old man, no past medical/psychiatric history or substance use.  
- **Chief Complaint**: 7-month history of worsened insomnia, with lifelong sleep difficulties.  
- **Key Symptoms/Signs**:  
  - Excessive worry about health deterioration and financial instability.  
  - Irritability, tension, and inattentiveness during the interview.  
  - Anticipatory anxiety (arrived 1 hour early for appointment).  
  - No fever or abnormal vital signs.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline**: Chronic insomnia since youth, exacerbated 7 months ago after heightened health awareness (post-sleep conference).  
- **Characteristics**:  
  - **Excessive, Persistent Worry**: Focused on health and finances, disproportionate to immediate threats.  
  - **Physical/Cognitive Symptoms**: Irritability, tension, impaired attention—consistent with anxiety.  
  - **Avoidance of Perceived Threats**: Preemptive arrival to avoid missing the appointment.  
- **Interrelationships**: Anxiety-driven insomnia and somatic tension reinforce each other, creating a cycle of distress.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)**:  
   - **Alignment**: Matches **excessive worry about multiple domains** (health, finances), **duration >6 months**, and physical symptoms (irritability, tension). DSM-5 criteria for GAD include ≥3 symptoms (e.g., restlessness, fatigue, difficulty concentrating).  
   - **Support**: Chronicity, diffuse worries, and functional impairment (health/financial fears affecting behavior).  
   - **Contradiction**: None—no evidence of another medical/psychiatric cause.  

2. **Adjustment Disorder**:  
   - **Alignment**: Could explain stress response post-conference.  
   - **Contradiction**: Symptoms exceed 6 months (adjustment disorder typically resolves within 6 months of stressor removal). No clear acute stressor identified.  

3. **Social Anxiety Disorder**:  
   - **Alignment**: None. No fear of social scrutiny or performance situations.  

4. **Agoraphobia**:  
   - **Alignment**: None. No avoidance of situations due to fear of inability to escape.  

5. **Normal Worry**:  
   - **Alignment**: None. Symptoms cause significant distress/impairment (e.g., insomnia, anticipatory anxiety), exceeding "normal" concerns.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1 (Generalized anxiety disorder)(广泛性焦虑障碍)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Chronic (>6 months), excessive worry across multiple domains (health, finances).  
  - Physical/cognitive symptoms (irritability, tension, inattentiveness) meeting DSM-5 criteria.  
  - Functional impairment (insomnia, anticipatory anxiety affecting behavior).  
  - Absence of alternative explanations (e.g., medical conditions, specific phobias).
