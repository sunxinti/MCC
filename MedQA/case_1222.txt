GPT's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** 53-year-old man.  
- **Chief Complaint:** Follow-up visit three days after being prescribed a selective alpha-1 agonist.  
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**  
  - Reports improvement in symptoms.  
  - No adverse effects experienced.  
- **Decisive Features:**  
  - Use of a selective alpha-1 agonist.  
  - Short-term improvement without side effects.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Timeline:** The patient is in a short-term follow-up (three days post-prescription), indicating an acute or subacute condition.  
- **Symptom Improvement:** Suggests the medication effectively addressed the underlying issue.  
- **No Adverse Effects:** Indicates tolerability and appropriate dosing of the medication.  
- **Selective Alpha-1 Agonist Use:** This class of drugs typically causes vasoconstriction, which can alleviate specific symptoms related to blood flow or smooth muscle contraction.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**

1. **Bronchospasm due to bronchial asthma:**  
   - **Alignment:** Bronchodilation in asthma is primarily managed with beta-2 agonists, not alpha-1 agonists.  
   - **Conclusion:** Unlikely.

2. **Bilateral hand tremors of indeterminate etiology:**  
   - **Alignment:** Alpha-1 agonists are not standard treatment for tremors.  
   - **Conclusion:** Unlikely.

3. **Urinary hesitancy due to benign prostatic hyperplasia:**  
   - **Alignment:** Treatment typically involves alpha-1 antagonists (e.g., tamsulosin) to relax prostatic smooth muscle, not agonists.  
   - **Conclusion:** Unlikely.

4. **Nasal congestion due to a viral infection:**  
   - **Alignment:** Selective alpha-1 agonists like pseudoephedrine are commonly used as decongestants to reduce nasal mucosal swelling via vasoconstriction.  
   - **Conclusion:** Highly likely.

5. **Blood pressure management prior to pheochromocytoma excision:**  
   - **Alignment:** This scenario requires alpha-adrenergic **blockers** (antagonists) to control hypertension, not agonists.  
   - **Conclusion:** Unlikely.

**4. Final Selection**

**My final selection is: Option 4 (Nasal congestion due to a viral infection)(由病毒感染引起的鼻塞)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 4 (Nasal congestion due to a viral infection)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 53-year-old male presented for follow-up three days after starting a selective alpha-1 agonist. His symptoms improved without adverse effects.  
- The key feature is the use of a selective alpha-1 agonist, which suggests a condition requiring vasoconstriction or management of symptoms mediated via alpha-1 receptors.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Mechanism of alpha-1 agonists**: These drugs bind to alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, causing vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure. They are commonly used for nasal congestion (e.g., pseudoephedrine) or to treat orthostatic hypotension (e.g., midodrine).  
- **Symptom improvement**: The patient’s improvement aligns with effective treatment of a condition responsive to alpha-1 agonists.  
- **Exclusion of other options**:  
  - Bronchospasm (Option 1) is treated with beta-2 agonists, not alpha-1 agonists.  
  - Hand tremors (Option 2) are unrelated to alpha-1 agonists and are typically addressed with other therapies.  
  - Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (Option 3) is managed with alpha-1 **antagonists** (e.g., tamsulosin), not agonists.  
  - Pheochromocytoma surgery (Option 5) requires alpha-1 **blockers** preoperatively to control hypertension, not agonists.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (Bronchospasm)**: Incorrect. Alpha-1 agonists cause vasoconstriction, not bronchodilation. Beta-2 agonists (e.g., albuterol) are used for asthma.  
- **Option 2 (Hand tremors)**: Incorrect. Tremors are not a primary indication for alpha-1 agonists; they may even exacerbate tremors as a side effect.  
- **Option 3 (Urinary hesitancy from BPH)**: Incorrect. Alpha-1 **blockers** relax prostate smooth muscle; agonists would worsen symptoms by causing constriction.  
- **Option 4 (Nasal congestion)**: Correct. Alpha-1 agonists like pseudoephedrine constrict nasal mucosal blood vessels, alleviating congestion. This aligns with symptom improvement.  
- **Option 5 (Pheochromocytoma surgery)**: Incorrect. Preoperative management requires alpha-1 **blockers** to prevent hypertensive crises, not agonists.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Nasal congestion due to a viral infection)(由病毒感染引起的鼻塞)**

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 4 (Nasal congestion due to a viral infection)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 53-year-old man returns for a follow-up three days after starting a **selective alpha-1 agonist**. He reports **symptom improvement** and **no adverse effects**.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Selective alpha-1 agonists** (e.g., phenylephrine) primarily act on vascular and smooth muscle alpha-1 receptors, causing **vasoconstriction** and **smooth muscle contraction**.  
- **Improvement in symptoms** suggests the drug targets a condition where alpha-1 activation is therapeutic.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Bronchospasm due to asthma**: Alpha-1 agonists **contract bronchial smooth muscle**, worsening bronchospasm. Beta-2 agonists (e.g., albuterol) are standard. **Eliminated**.  
2. **Hand tremors**: Beta-blockers or anticonvulsants are used for tremors. Alpha-1 agonists lack a role here. **Eliminated**.  
3. **Urinary hesitancy due to BPH**: Alpha-1 **blockers** (e.g., tamsulosin) relax prostate smooth muscle. Alpha-1 agonists would **worsen obstruction**, contradicting symptom improvement. **Eliminated**.  
4. **Nasal congestion due to viral infection**: Alpha-1 agonists (e.g., phenylephrine) act as decongestants by constricting nasal mucosal blood vessels. **Directly aligns with symptom improvement**.  
5. **BP management pre-pheochromocytoma excision**: Alpha-1 **blockers** (e.g., phenoxybenzamine) are essential preoperatively. Alpha-1 agonists would exacerbate hypertension. **Eliminated**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Nasal congestion due to a viral infection)(病毒性感染引起的鼻充血)**  
- **Key evidence**: Selective alpha-1 agonists are first-line decongestants for nasal congestion. Symptom improvement confirms this mechanism. Other options either contradict pharmacological principles or lack clinical relevance.
