Case_id: case_186
Case_description: 
A laboratory primarily involved with studying cellular proofreading mechanisms is investigating the question of whether the ribosome can recognize a mischarged amino acid and still be incorporated into the growing peptide. In order to do so, they biochemically charge a Lys-tRNA with valine instead of lysine and insert the tRNA into the cell. They design an mRNA sequence that contains only codons for lysine. Which of the following will most likely occur?
Options: 
1. The ribosome will recognize the mischarged tRNA and prevent its incorporation by removing the valine
2. The ribosome will recognize the inappropriately inserted valine residue and terminate protein translation
3. The mischarged tRNA with valine will be incorporated in the codons that specificy for lysine
4. The mischarged tRNA will be degraded by the proteasome
5. The mischarged tRNA will be removed by the lysyl-tRNA synthetase
Correct Answer: The mischarged tRNA with valine will be incorporated in the codons that specificy for lysine

**1. Case Summary and Key Features**
- **Experiment Overview:** A laboratory is investigating whether ribosomes can recognize and handle mischarged amino acids during protein synthesis. Specifically, they have artificially charged lysine-tRNA (Lys-tRNA) with valine instead of lysine. This mischarged tRNA is then introduced into the cell. The mRNA sequence used in the experiment contains only codons that specify lysine.
- **Key Focus:** Understanding the ribosome's ability to detect and manage mischarged tRNAs, and the subsequent fate of the valine incorporated in place of lysine during protein translation.

**2. Analysis of Experimental Features**
- **Charging Specificity:** Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are responsible for attaching the correct amino acid to its corresponding tRNA. While these enzymes have proofreading mechanisms, the experimental setup bypasses this by artificially mischarging Lys-tRNA with valine.
- **Ribosomal Function:** The ribosome primarily ensures the correct amino acid incorporation based on codon-anticodon pairing but lacks mechanisms to verify the chemical nature of the attached amino acid.
- **mRNA Codons:** The mRNA sequence exclusively contains lysine codons (e.g., AAA or AAG), which normally pair with Lys-tRNA carrying lysine.
- **Potential Outcomes:** Without ribosomal proofreading for amino acid identity, the mischarged tRNA could be incorporated into the growing peptide chain, substituting valine for lysine at each lysine codon.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**
1. **Option 1:** The ribosome lacks mechanisms to remove or correct mischarged amino acids once the tRNA is bound; thus, it's unlikely to remove valine.
2. **Option 2:** The ribosome does not typically recognize amino acid misincorporation as a reason to terminate translation; instead, it continues elongation.
3. **Option 3:** Given the ribosome's inability to check the accuracy of the attached amino acid, the mischarged tRNA is likely to be incorporated, leading to valine substitution at lysine codons.
4. **Option 4:** The proteasome degrades proteins, not tRNAs. Therefore, it would not directly target the mischarged tRNA.
5. **Option 5:** Lysyl-tRNA synthetase’s proofreading occurs before amino acid attachment. Once the tRNA is mischarged and introduced into the cell, the synthetase is unlikely to remove the valine.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 3 (The mischarged tRNA with valine will be incorporated in the codons that specify for lysine)(错误充电的tRNA携带缬氨酸将被纳入指定赖氨酸密码子的密码子中)**

Choice: Option 3 (The mischarged tRNA with valine will be incorporated in the codons that specificy for lysine)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
The case involves a laboratory experiment where a Lys-tRNA is artificially charged with valine (instead of lysine) and introduced into a cell. The mRNA used contains only lysine codons. The key question is whether the ribosome will recognize the mischarged tRNA and its amino acid, leading to specific outcomes such as rejection, termination, or incorporation.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Mechanism of Translation:** The ribosome primarily ensures codon-anticodon pairing accuracy. The proofreading of aminoacylation (ensuring the correct amino acid is attached to its tRNA) is typically performed by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases before tRNA enters the ribosome.  
- **Mischarged tRNA:** Here, the Lys-tRNA carries valine, but its anticodon still matches the lysine codons on the mRNA. The ribosome’s role is to verify codon-anticodon pairing, not the amino acid’s identity.  
- **Experimental Setup:** Since the mRNA specifies only lysine residues, the ribosome would expect a correctly charged Lys-tRNA. However, the anticodon on the mischarged Lys-tRNA (with valine) still matches the lysine codon.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1:** The ribosome does not directly hydrolyze amino acids. Proofreading of aminoacylation is performed by synthetases, not the ribosome.  
- **Option 2:** Translation termination is triggered by stop codons, not misincorporated amino acids. The ribosome cannot detect the incorrect amino acid post-anticodon pairing.  
- **Option 3:** The ribosome recognizes the anticodon-codon match (lysine codon ↔ Lys-tRNA anticodon) and allows incorporation of the amino acid (valine in this case). This aligns with the ribosome’s primary function.  
- **Option 4:** The proteasome degrades misfolded proteins, not tRNAs. The mischarged tRNA itself is not targeted for proteasomal degradation.  
- **Option 5:** Lysyl-tRNA synthetase may correct mischarging *before* the tRNA enters the ribosome. However, the experiment assumes the mischarged tRNA is already introduced into the cell, bypassing this step.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (The mischarged tRNA with valine will be incorporated in the codons that specificy for lysine)** (错误充电的携带缬氨酸的tRNA将被掺入指定赖氨酸的密码子中)  

The ribosome’s role is to ensure codon-anticodon pairing, not amino acid identity. Since the Lys-tRNA’s anticodon matches the lysine codons on the mRNA, the ribosome will incorporate the mischarged valine into the peptide chain. This outcome is consistent with the known mechanisms of translation and proofreading.

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 3 (The mischarged tRNA with valine will be incorporated in the codons that specificy for lysine)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A laboratory investigates whether ribosomes can recognize mischarged tRNAs. They charged a Lys-tRNA with valine (instead of lysine) and introduced it into a cell. The mRNA contains only lysine codons.  
- **Key experimental setup**: Mischarged tRNA (Valine attached to Lys-tRNA) + mRNA with exclusively lysine codons.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- The ribosome primarily checks **codon-anticodon pairing**, not the amino acid attached to tRNA. Since the anticodon of the mischarged Lys-tRNA matches lysine codons, the ribosome will accept it.  
- Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (e.g., lysyl-tRNA synthetase) normally proofread during tRNA charging. However, in this experiment, the tRNA was **pre-charged biochemically**, bypassing the synthetase’s proofreading. Post-charging editing by synthetases is unlikely, as their primary role is during initial charging.  
- The proteasome degrades proteins, not tRNAs (eliminating Option 4). Ribosomes lack mechanisms to remove amino acids (Option 1) or terminate translation due to incorrect amino acids (Option 2).  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 3**: Aligns with the ribosome’s reliance on codon-anticodon matching. The mischarged tRNA’s anticodon matches lysine codons, leading to valine incorporation.  
- **Option 5**: Unlikely because lysyl-tRNA synthetase edits during charging, not after the tRNA is released. The pre-charged tRNA bypasses this step.  
- Options 1, 2, and 4 are inconsistent with ribosomal function and cellular machinery.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (The mischarged tRNA with valine will be incorporated in the codons that specify for lysine)(错误携带缬氨酸的tRNA将被并入指定赖氨酸的密码子中)**  
- **Key Evidence**: Ribosomes do not verify amino acids, only codon-anticodon pairing. The mischarged tRNA’s anticodon matches lysine codons, ensuring incorporation. Synthetase proofreading occurs during charging, not post-insertion.
