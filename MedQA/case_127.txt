Case_description: 
A 67-year-old man with peripheral neuropathy comes to the physician for a follow-up examination after the results of serum protein electrophoresis showed monoclonal gammopathy. A complete blood count, serum creatinine, and serum electrolyte concentrations are within the reference ranges. A bone marrow biopsy shows 6% monoclonal plasma cells. Further analysis shows that class I major histocompatibility molecules are downregulated in these monoclonal plasma cells. The proliferation of these monoclonal plasma cells is normally prevented by a class of immune cells that lyse abnormal cells without the need for opsonization, priming, or prior activation. Which of the following best describes this class of immune cells?
Options: 
1. CD8+ T lymphocytes
2. Bone marrow-derived macrophages
3. CD4+ T lymphocytes
4. Natural killer cells
5. Band neutrophils
Correct Answer: Natural killer cells

GPT's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** 67-year-old man with a history of peripheral neuropathy.
- **Chief Complaint:** Follow-up examination after discovering monoclonal gammopathy via serum protein electrophoresis.
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**
  - Serum protein electrophoresis shows monoclonal gammopathy.
  - Complete blood count, serum creatinine, and serum electrolyte levels are within normal ranges.
  - Bone marrow biopsy reveals 6% monoclonal plasma cells.
  - Downregulation of class I major histocompatibility molecules in monoclonal plasma cells.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Monoclonal Gammopathy:** Indicates a clonal proliferation of plasma cells, which can be associated with conditions like monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) or multiple myeloma.
- **Bone Marrow Findings:** 6% monoclonal plasma cells are below the threshold for multiple myeloma (>10%) and may suggest MGUS, especially in the absence of end-organ damage (e.g., normal creatinine).
- **Downregulation of MHC Class I Molecules:** This is a mechanism often employed by malignant or abnormal cells to evade immune surveillance, particularly from cytotoxic T cells.
- **Immune Surveillance:** The normal prevention of monoclonal plasma cell proliferation involves immune cells that can target abnormally presenting cells without prior activation.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: CD8+ T lymphocytes**
  - **Role:** Cytotoxic T cells recognize and kill cells presenting abnormal antigens via MHC class I.
  - **Relevance:** They require antigen presentation through MHC I, which is downregulated in this case, limiting their effectiveness.
- **Option 2: Bone marrow-derived macrophages**
  - **Role:** Macrophages phagocytose pathogens and cellular debris, involved in presenting antigens to T cells.
  - **Relevance:** They rely on opsonization and are not primarily responsible for lysing abnormal cells without prior activation.
- **Option 3: CD4+ T lymphocytes**
  - **Role:** Helper T cells assist other immune cells through cytokine secretion.
  - **Relevance:** They do not directly lyse target cells and require antigen presentation via MHC class II.
- **Option 4: Natural killer cells**
  - **Role:** Innate immune cells that can kill virally infected cells and tumor cells without prior sensitization.
  - **Relevance:** They identify and lyse cells with downregulated MHC class I through the "missing self" hypothesis.
- **Option 5: Band neutrophils**
  - **Role:** Immature neutrophils involved in acute inflammatory responses.
  - **Relevance:** They are not primarily responsible for lysing abnormal cells in the context described.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 Natural killer cells (自然杀伤细胞)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 4 (Natural killer cells)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 67-year-old man with peripheral neuropathy presents for follow-up after serum protein electrophoresis revealed monoclonal gammopathy.  
- Key findings:  
  - Bone marrow biopsy shows 6% monoclonal plasma cells.  
  - Class I MHC molecules are downregulated in these plasma cells.  
- The critical diagnostic clue is the downregulation of MHC class I molecules on monoclonal plasma cells, which likely impairs their recognition by specific immune cells.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Monoclonal gammopathy** suggests a plasma cell disorder (e.g., monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance [MGUS], multiple myeloma, or related malignancy). The bone marrow biopsy showing 6% clonal plasma cells is consistent with MGUS (a precursor to overt plasma cell dyscrasias).  
- **MHC class I downregulation** in the plasma cells is significant because MHC class I molecules are critical for CD8+ T-cell recognition of abnormal cells. Their absence would impair T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity.  
- The question specifies that the immune cells in question can lyse abnormal cells **without opsonization, priming, or prior activation**, which aligns with natural killer (NK) cell function.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (CD8+ T lymphocytes):** CD8+ T cells rely on MHC class I molecules to recognize and kill target cells. Since the plasma cells have downregulated MHC class I, CD8+ T cells would be ineffective here. **Unlikely.**  
- **Option 2 (Bone marrow-derived macrophages):** Macrophages typically require opsonization (e.g., antibodies or complement) to phagocytose or kill targets. The question explicitly excludes opsonization, making this option inconsistent. **Unlikely.**  
- **Option 3 (CD4+ T lymphocytes):** CD4+ T cells are helper cells and do not directly lyse target cells. They also do not function in the described mechanism. **Unlikely.**  
- **Option 4 (Natural killer cells):** NK cells recognize cells with low MHC class I expression (due to loss of inhibitory signals) and directly lyse them via perforin/granzyme or death receptor pathways. They do not require prior activation, priming, or opsonization. This perfectly matches the scenario. **Most likely.**  
- **Option 5 (Band neutrophils):** Neutrophils primarily combat bacterial infections through phagocytosis and require opsonization. They are unrelated to the described mechanism. **Unlikely.**  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Natural killer cells)(自然杀伤细胞)**  

Key evidence:  
- NK cells are uniquely capable of directly lysing cells with MHC class I downregulation without prior activation or opsonization.  
- CD8+ T cells and macrophages are excluded due to their reliance on MHC class I or opsonization, respectively.

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 4 (Natural killer cells)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 67-year-old man with peripheral neuropathy and monoclonal gammopathy.  
- **Key Findings**:  
  - Serum protein electrophoresis reveals monoclonal gammopathy.  
  - Normal CBC, serum creatinine, and electrolytes.  
  - Bone marrow biopsy: 6% monoclonal plasma cells (below diagnostic threshold for multiple myeloma).  
  - Monoclonal plasma cells exhibit **downregulation of class I MHC molecules**.  
  - Critical clue: Immune cells that **lyse abnormal cells without opsonization, priming, or prior activation** are implicated in controlling these plasma cells.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Monoclonal gammopathy**: Suggests a plasma cell disorder (e.g., MGUS or smoldering myeloma).  
- **Class I MHC downregulation**: A common immune evasion mechanism in malignancies. Cells lacking MHC I evade detection by CD8+ T cells, which require MHC I-antigen complexes for activation.  
- **Immune cell mechanism described**:  
  - **No opsonization/priming/activation needed**: Rules out macrophages (require opsonization) and T cells (require priming and MHC-antigen recognition).  
  - Targets "missing self" (cells lacking MHC I): Strongly aligns with **natural killer (NK) cells**, which detect absent MHC I via inhibitory receptor loss.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **CD8+ T lymphocytes**: Require MHC I-antigen recognition and prior activation. **Excluded** due to MHC I downregulation.  
2. **Bone marrow-derived macrophages**: Phagocytose opsonized targets. **Excluded** (no opsonization needed).  
3. **CD4+ T lymphocytes**: Helper T cells; not cytotoxic. **Excluded**.  
4. **Natural killer cells**: Kill cells with **absent MHC I** ("missing self") without prior activation. **Strongly supported** by the case description.  
5. **Band neutrophils**: Target bacteria, not tumor cells. **Excluded**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4 (Natural killer cells)(自然杀伤细胞)**  
- **Key evidence**:  
  - NK cells lyse abnormal cells via "missing self" recognition (MHC I downregulation).  
  - Function independently of opsonization, priming, or prior activation.  
  - Directly explains the mechanism preventing plasma cell proliferation in this case.
