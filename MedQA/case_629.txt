Case_description: 
A 16-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by ambulance from a soccer game. During the game, he was about to kick the ball when another player collided with his leg from the front. He was unable to stand up after this collision and reported severe knee pain. On presentation, he was found to have a mild knee effusion. Physical exam showed that his knee could be pushed posteriorly at 90 degrees of flexion but it could not be pulled anteriorly in the same position. The anatomic structure that was most likely injured in this patient has which of the following characteristics?
Options: 
1. Runs anteriorly from the lateral femoral condyle
2. Runs anteriorly from the medial femoral condyle
3. Runs medially from the lateral femoral condyle
4. Runs posteriorly from the lateral femoral condyle
5. Runs posteriorly from the medial femoral condyle
Correct Answer: Runs posteriorly from the medial femoral condyle

Choice: Option 5 (Runs posteriorly from the medial femoral condyle)

GPT's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** A 16-year-old male athlete.
- **Chief Complaint:** Severe knee pain following a collision during a soccer game.
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:** 
  - Inability to stand post-injury.
  - Mild knee effusion observed on presentation.
  - Physical examination findings:
    - Posterior drawer test: Knee can be pushed posteriorly at 90 degrees of flexion (negative posterior drawer sign).
    - Anterior drawer test: Knee cannot be pulled anteriorly at 90 degrees of flexion (positive anterior drawer sign).

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Mechanism of Injury:** Direct collision to the front of the leg during a soccer game suggests a potential force applied to the knee joint, possibly causing ligamentous injury.
- **Inability to Stand:** Indicates significant instability or pain, often associated with major ligament tears such as the ACL or PCL.
- **Knee Effusion:** Indicates an acute intra-articular injury, commonly seen with ligament tears or meniscal injuries.
- **Drawer Tests:**
  - **Posterior Drawer Test:** Negative result suggests that the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) is likely intact.
  - **Anterior Drawer Test:** Positive result indicates potential injury to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), as the knee moves forward excessively when force is applied.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Runs anteriorly from the lateral femoral condyle**
  - This description does not correspond to any major knee ligament. The ACL does not run anteriorly from the lateral femoral condyle.
- **Option 2: Runs anteriorly from the medial femoral condyle**
  - The ACL originates near the medial femoral condyle but runs posteriorly, not anteriorly.
- **Option 3: Runs medially from the lateral femoral condyle**
  - This does not accurately describe the ACL or other major knee ligaments.
- **Option 4: Runs posteriorly from the lateral femoral condyle**
  - The PCL originates from the posterior aspect of the lateral femoral condyle; however, the negative posterior drawer test suggests the PCL is intact, making this option less likely.
- **Option 5: Runs posteriorly from the medial femoral condyle**
  - The ACL originates from the posterior part of the medial femoral condyle and runs anteriorly to attach to the tibia. A positive anterior drawer sign aligns with an ACL injury, making this the most consistent option.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 5 (Runs posteriorly from the medial femoral condyle)(从股骨内侧髁后方延伸)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 5 (Runs posteriorly from the medial femoral condyle)

Qwen's full response:

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 16-year-old male presents to the emergency department with severe knee pain and inability to stand after a frontal collision during a soccer game.  
- Key clinical manifestations: mild knee effusion, positive posterior drawer test (posterior displacement of the tibia at 90° flexion), and negative anterior drawer test (no anterior displacement in the same position).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- The mechanism of injury (frontal collision) suggests a direct force leading to hyperextension or posterior shear stress on the knee.  
- The posterior drawer test positivity indicates impaired restraint of posterior tibial displacement, which is primarily the role of the **posterior cruciate ligament (PCL)**.  
- The negative anterior drawer test suggests intact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) function, ruling out ACL injury.  
- The combination of effusion and ligamentous instability localizes the injury to the knee’s posterior structures.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (Runs anteriorly from the lateral femoral condyle):** This describes the ACL (originates from the tibial plateau and inserts posteriorly on the lateral femoral condyle). However, the ACL injury would cause anterior instability (positive anterior drawer), which is absent here. **Unlikely**.  
- **Option 2 (Runs anteriorly from the medial femoral condyle):** Not anatomically accurate for any major knee ligament. The medial collateral ligament (MCL) originates from the medial femoral condyle but runs medially, not anteriorly. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 3 (Runs medially from the lateral femoral condyle):** Matches the MCL’s lateral-to-medial course but does not explain posterior instability. MCL injuries typically present with valgus stress instability, not posterior displacement. **Unlikely**.  
- **Option 4 (Runs posteriorly from the lateral femoral condyle):** The PCL originates from the **medial femoral condyle**, not the lateral, making this anatomically incorrect. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 5 (Runs posteriorly from the medial femoral condyle):** Correctly describes the PCL’s origin and course (from the posterior aspect of the medial femoral condyle to the posterior tibial plateau). This aligns with the posterior drawer sign and clinical presentation. **Most likely**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 5 (Runs posteriorly from the medial femoral condyle)(起自内侧股骨髁并向后走行)**

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 5 (Runs posteriorly from the medial femoral condyle)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 16-year-old male with acute knee injury during soccer.  
- **Mechanism**: Direct frontal collision to the leg while attempting to kick the ball.  
- **Key Findings**:  
  - Severe knee pain, inability to stand.  
  - Mild knee effusion.  
  - **Posterior drawer test positive** (knee can be pushed posteriorly at 90° flexion).  
  - **Anterior drawer test negative** (no excessive anterior movement).  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Posterior Drawer Test Positivity**: Indicates excessive posterior tibial translation, strongly suggesting **posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury**.  
- **Anterior Drawer Test Negativity**: No increased anterior tibial movement, ruling out anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear.  
- **Mechanism of Injury**: Frontal force to the flexed knee (e.g., dashboard injury analog) aligns with PCL injury patterns.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Option 1 (Runs anteriorly from lateral femoral condyle)**: Describes ACL anatomy. ACL injury would cause anterior laxity (positive anterior drawer), which is absent here. **Excluded**.  
2. **Option 2 (Runs anteriorly from medial femoral condyle)**: No ligament originates anteriorly from the medial femoral condyle. **Anatomically incorrect**.  
3. **Option 3 (Runs medially from lateral femoral condyle)**: Describes lateral collateral ligament (LCL). LCL injury causes lateral instability, not posterior laxity. **Excluded**.  
4. **Option 4 (Runs posteriorly from lateral femoral condyle)**: No major ligament originates here. **Anatomically incorrect**.  
5. **Option 5 (Runs posteriorly from medial femoral condyle)**: Matches PCL anatomy. The PCL originates from the **posterolateral aspect of the medial femoral condyle** and runs posteriorly to the tibia. Injury explains posterior laxity and mechanism. **Strongly supported**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 5 (Runs posteriorly from the medial femoral condyle)(从股骨内侧髁后侧延伸)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Positive posterior drawer test confirms PCL injury.  
  - PCL originates from the **posterolateral surface of the medial femoral condyle** and prevents posterior tibial displacement.  
  - Mechanism of injury (frontal force to flexed knee) and intact ACL (negative anterior drawer) further corroborate PCL involvement.
