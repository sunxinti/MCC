Case_description: 
A 15-year-old girl is brought to the physician because she has not had a menstrual period. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 57 kg (125 lb); BMI is 21 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the breasts shows a secondary mound formed by the nipple and areola. Pubic hair is sparse and lightly pigmented. Abdominal examination shows bilateral firm, nontender inguinal masses. Pelvic examination shows a blind-ended vaginal pouch. Ultrasonography does not show a uterus or ovaries. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition?
Options: 
1. Spironolactone therapy
2. Gonadectomy
3. Testosterone therapy
4. Vaginal dilatory therapy
5. Prednisolone therapy
Correct Answer: Gonadectomy

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**
- **Patient Information:** A 15-year-old female adolescent.
- **Chief Complaint:** Primary amenorrhea (absence of menstrual periods).
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:**
  - **Physical Development:** Stature is within normal range (165 cm, BMI 21 kg/m²). Breast development has reached a secondary mound, indicating adequate estrogen effect. Pubic hair is sparse and lightly pigmented.
  - **Clinical Findings:** Bilateral firm, non-tender inguinal masses suggest undescended testes. Pelvic examination reveals a blind-ended vaginal pouch.
  - **Imaging:** Ultrasonography shows absence of the uterus and ovaries.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**
- **Primary Amenorrhea:** Indicates an underlying reproductive or hormonal abnormality.
- **Female Phenotype with Masculine Undescended Gonads:** Suggests a disorder of sex development.
- **Secondary Sexual Characteristics:** Adequate breast development points towards estrogen effect, likely from peripheral conversion of androgens.
- **Sparse Pubic Hair:** Indicates impaired androgen action.
- **Absence of Uterus and Ovaries:** Aligns with a 46,XY karyotype condition where internal female reproductive structures are absent.
- **Undescended Testes:** Common in Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS), increasing the risk of gonadal malignancy if not addressed.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**
- **Option 1: Spironolactone therapy**
  - **Relevance:** Spironolactone is an anti-androgen used in conditions like acne or hypertension but is not indicated in AIS.
- **Option 2: Gonadectomy**
  - **Relevance:** In AIS, undescended testes have a high risk of malignancy post-puberty. Gonadectomy is recommended after achieving adequate estrogenization.
- **Option 3: Testosterone therapy**
  - **Relevance:** Not appropriate in AIS, where androgen receptors are insensitive. The patient already exhibits feminized characteristics due to estrogen.
- **Option 4: Vaginal dilatory therapy**
  - **Relevance:** May address vaginal length but does not address the primary concern of gonadal malignancy risk.
- **Option 5: Prednisolone therapy**
  - **Relevance:** Used for adrenal insufficiency or inflammatory conditions, not applicable to AIS.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Gonadectomy) (切除性腺手术)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 2 (Gonadectomy)

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 15-year-old girl presents with primary amenorrhea. Key clinical features include breast development at stage II (secondary mound of the nipple and areola), sparse and lightly pigmented pubic hair, bilateral firm, nontender inguinal masses, and a blind-ended vaginal pouch on pelvic examination. Ultrasonography reveals absence of the uterus and ovaries.  
- Decisive symptoms: **absence of uterus/ovaries**, **inguinal masses**, and **discordant sexual maturation** (breast development without adequate pubic hair).  

---

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Primary amenorrhea** at age 15 is a red flag for congenital anomalies, hormonal disorders, or genital tract malformations.  
- **Discordant sexual maturation**: Breast development (stage II) suggests some estrogen exposure, but sparse pubic hair indicates inadequate androgen signaling. This is classic in conditions like **androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS)** or **Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome**, but MRKH typically preserves ovaries.  
- **Inguinal masses**: Firm, nontender masses in a patient with absent ovaries and uterus raise suspicion for **undescended testes** (common in AIS).  
- **Vaginal pouch**: A blind-ended vaginal pouch and absence of the uterus/ovaries align with **complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS)**, where the Müllerian structures (uterus, fallopian tubes) fail to develop, and the vagina may form only partially.  

---

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1 (Spironolactone therapy)**: Antagonizes androgens. Unlikely needed here, as the issue is lack of androgen signaling, not excess.  
- **Option 2 (Gonadectomy)**: Critical if the inguinal masses are undescended testes (as in CAIS). Testes in AIS are prone to malignant transformation (e.g., dysgerminoma). Removing them reduces cancer risk and addresses hormone imbalance.  
- **Option 3 (Testosterone therapy)**: Contradicted in AIS, as the body is unresponsive to androgens. Testosterone would not improve symptoms.  
- **Option 4 (Vaginal dilatory therapy)**: Useful for vaginal agenesis (e.g., MRKH), but MRKH preserves ovaries. This patient’s absence of ovaries and uterine remnants makes MRKH unlikely.  
- **Option 5 (Prednisolone therapy)**: No role in congenital gonadal or duct anomalies.  

---

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Gonadectomy) (性腺切除术)**  
**Key evidence**:  
- The **inguinal masses** are highly suggestive of undescended testes in a patient with XY chromosomes (CAIS).  
- Absence of ovaries and uterus confirms a disorder of sex development (DSD), with gonadal dysgenesis or insensitivity.  
- **Gonadectomy is critical** to prevent malignancy in nonfunctional testes and aligns with the diagnosis of CAIS.

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient**: 15-year-old girl with primary amenorrhea.  
- **Key Findings**:  
  - Breast development: Secondary mound (nipple/areola prominence, Tanner stage 3).  
  - Sparse, lightly pigmented pubic hair (Tanner stage 2).  
  - Bilateral firm, nontender inguinal masses.  
  - Blind vaginal pouch; absent uterus/ovaries on ultrasound.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Primary Amenorrhea**: Absence of menarche despite breast development suggests partial pubertal progression but incomplete sexual maturation.  
- **Absent Uterus/Ovaries**: Indicates Müllerian agenesis or a disorder of sexual development (DSD). Müllerian agenesis (e.g., MRKH syndrome) typically retains ovaries, which this patient lacks.  
- **Inguinal Masses**: Likely undescended testes (46XY DSD).  
- **Sparse Pubic Hair**: Suggests androgen insensitivity (e.g., complete androgen insensitivity syndrome [CAIS]) due to resistance to testosterone-driven pubic hair growth.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Spironolactone**: Anti-androgen for hirsutism or PCOS—irrelevant here (no hyperandrogenism).  
2. **Gonadectomy**: Critical for CAIS to prevent malignancy in undescended testes (5–10% risk of germ cell tumors). Aligns with absent ovaries, inguinal masses, and 46XY DSD.  
3. **Testosterone Therapy**: Contraindicated; patient has female phenotype and androgen resistance.  
4. **Vaginal Dilatory Therapy**: Addresses vaginal hypoplasia (e.g., MRKH) but does not treat the underlying DSD or gonadal risk.  
5. **Prednisolone**: Treats congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), which presents with virilization (absent here).  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2 (Gonadectomy) (性腺切除术)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Inguinal masses consistent with undescended testes in a 46XY DSD (e.g., CAIS).  
  - Absent uterus/ovaries and blind vaginal pouch confirm Müllerian structure absence.  
  - Gonadectomy is standard to mitigate malignancy risk in CAIS.  
  - Other options fail to address the primary pathology (gonadal malignancy risk).
