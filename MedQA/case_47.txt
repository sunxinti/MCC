Case_description: 
A 55-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-week history of tingling pain in the sole of his right foot when he raises it above chest level during exercises. He reports that he started exercising regularly 2 months ago and that his right calf cramps when he uses the incline feature on the treadmill, forcing him to take frequent breaks. The pain completely disappears after resting for a few minutes. He has an 8-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 34 years. His only medication is metformin. His pulse is 82/min, and blood pressure is 170/92 mm Hg. Straight leg raise test elicits pallor and tingling pain in the right foot. There is no pain in the back. His muscle strength is normal. Femoral pulses are palpable; right pedal pulses are absent. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options: 
1. Femoropopliteal artery stenosis
2. Vasculitis of the right popliteal artery
3. Acute thrombosis of right popliteal vein
4. Lumbar spinal stenosis
5. Aortoiliac artery stenosis

================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Information:** 55-year-old man with an 8-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and a 34-year history of heavy smoking (two packs per day).
- **Chief Complaint:** 6-week history of tingling pain in the sole of the right foot when raising it above chest level during exercise.
- **Key Clinical Manifestations:** 
  - Right calf cramps during incline treadmill use, relieved by rest.
  - Straight leg raise test induces pallor and tingling in the right foot.
  - Absence of right pedal pulses despite palpable femoral pulses.
  - Elevated blood pressure (170/92 mm Hg).
  - No back pain and normal muscle strength.

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Onset and Duration:** The symptoms began 6 weeks ago, correlating with the start of regular exercise 2 months prior.
- **Symptom Characteristics:**  
  - **Intermittent Claudication:** Pain induced by exercise and relieved by rest is suggestive of arterial insufficiency.
  - **Neurological Signs:** Tingling pain during the straight leg raise test indicates possible neurovascular compromise.
- **Risk Factors:** Long-term diabetes and heavy smoking are significant risk factors for peripheral arterial disease (PAD).
- **Physical Examination Findings:** 
  - Absence of pedal pulses suggests arterial stenosis or obstruction distal to the femoral artery.
  - Palpable femoral pulses indicate that the site of obstruction is likely in the femoropopliteal segment.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Femoropopliteal artery stenosis:**  
   - **Alignment with Presentation:** Classic cause of intermittent claudication due to PAD. The location explains absent pedal pulses with palpable femoral pulses.
   - **Supportive Features:** Exercise-induced pain relieved by rest, tingling sensations, and risk factors align well.
2. **Vasculitis of the right popliteal artery:**  
   - **Less Likely:** Typically presents with more systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, or elevated inflammatory markers.
3. **Acute thrombosis of right popliteal vein:**  
   - **Opposes Presentation:** Would present with signs of venous insufficiency like swelling and pain, not arterial insufficiency.
4. **Lumbar spinal stenosis:**  
   - **Less Likely:** Usually associated with back pain and neurogenic claudication, which are absent in this case.
5. **Aortoiliac artery stenosis:**  
   - **Opposes Findings:** Would likely affect femoral pulses bilaterally and present with more proximal symptoms.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1 (Femoropopliteal artery stenosis)(股膝动脉狭窄)**

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 1 (Femoropopliteal artery stenosis)

Qwen's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 55-year-old male with an 8-year history of type 2 diabetes and a 34-year smoking history presents with 6 weeks of tingling pain in the right foot when raising it above chest level during exercise, calf cramps during treadmill inclines, and rest-dependent pain resolution.  
- Key clinical findings: Absent right pedal pulses, palpable femoral pulses, straight leg raise test elicits pallor and tingling, normal muscle strength, and no back pain.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Exercise-induced symptoms**: Claudication (pain during exertion, relieved by rest) and calf cramps strongly suggest peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The calf involvement localizes the arterial blockage distally.  
- **Positional pain**: Pain worsens when the leg is elevated, which may reduce venous return but exacerbates arterial insufficiency due to gravity-dependent flow dynamics, aligning with arterial occlusion.  
- **Absent pedal pulses**: Suggest distal arterial compromise (e.g., below the knee). Palpable femoral pulses indicate the lesion is distal to the femoral artery.  
- **No back pain or neurological deficits**: Rules out lumbar spinal stenosis or nerve root compression.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Femoropopliteal artery stenosis**:  
   - **Support**: Claudication, calf cramps, absent pedal pulses, and intact femoral pulses. This segment is a common site for atherosclerosis in diabetic smokers.  
   - **Opposition**: None; all features align with distal arterial stenosis.  

2. **Vasculitis of the right popliteal artery**:  
   - **Support**: Vasculitis can cause arterial occlusion.  
   - **Opposition**: No systemic signs (e.g., fever, elevated inflammatory markers), and the patient’s risk factors (diabetes, smoking) favor atherosclerosis over vasculitis.  

3. **Acute thrombosis of right popliteal vein**:  
   - **Support**: Absent pedal pulses might suggest arterial spasm secondary to DVT, but this is less likely.  
   - **Opposition**: DVT typically causes pain at rest, swelling, warmth, and a palpable cord, which are absent here.  

4. **Lumbar spinal stenosis**:  
   - **Support**: Neurogenic claudication (pain with walking, relieved by rest) mimics PAD.  
   - **Opposition**: No back pain, normal muscle strength, and absent pedal pulses are inconsistent with nerve compression.  

5. **Aortoiliac artery stenosis**:  
   - **Support**: Causes claudication, but femoral pulses are intact here.  
   - **Opposition**: Aortoiliac lesions typically reduce femoral pulses, which are normal in this case.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1 (Femoropopliteal artery stenosis)(股浅动脉狭窄)**

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 1 (Femoropopliteal artery stenosis)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Profile**: 55-year-old man with type 2 diabetes mellitus (8 years), heavy smoking history (2 packs/day for 34 years), and hypertension (BP 170/92 mm Hg).  
- **Chief Complaint**: Tingling pain in the sole of the right foot during exercise (6 weeks), exacerbated by leg elevation (e.g., treadmill incline), relieved by rest.  
- **Key Findings**:  
  - Absent right pedal pulses.  
  - Pallor and tingling in the right foot during straight leg raise test (no back pain).  
  - Normal muscle strength and palpable femoral pulses.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Exercise-Induced Pain with Rest Relief**: Classic for **vascular claudication** (arterial insufficiency). Pain occurs due to increased oxygen demand during exercise, unmet by stenotic arteries.  
- **Absent Pedal Pulses + Preserved Femoral Pulses**: Localizes arterial stenosis to the **femoropopliteal segment** (distal to femoral artery, proximal to pedal arteries).  
- **Straight Leg Raise Test**: Elevation reduces arterial perfusion pressure, worsening ischemia (pallor) and triggering pain.  
- **Risk Factors**: Diabetes, smoking, and hypertension accelerate atherosclerosis, strongly supporting peripheral artery disease (PAD).  
- **Contradicts Other Diagnoses**:  
  - No systemic symptoms (e.g., fever, weight loss) to suggest vasculitis.  
  - No swelling, redness, or sudden onset to indicate venous thrombosis.  
  - Normal muscle strength and absence of back pain argue against spinal stenosis.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Femoropopliteal Artery Stenosis**:  
   - **Alignment**: Matches claudication pattern, absent pedal pulses, and risk factors. Straight leg raise-induced pallor is pathognomonic for arterial insufficiency.  
   - **Evidence**: Atherosclerosis in diabetic smokers commonly affects femoropopliteal arteries.  
2. **Vasculitis of Right Popliteal Artery**:  
   - **Contradictions**: No systemic inflammation, asymmetric involvement, or laboratory findings (e.g., elevated CRP/ESR).  
3. **Acute Thrombosis of Right Popliteal Vein**:  
   - **Contradictions**: Venous thrombosis causes swelling and warmth, not positional claudication. Pedal pulses are typically preserved.  
4. **Lumbar Spinal Stenosis**:  
   - **Contradictions**: Neurogenic claudication improves with sitting (not rest alone) and lacks vascular signs (e.g., absent pulses).  
5. **Aortoiliac Artery Stenosis**:  
   - **Contradictions**: Femoral pulses would be diminished/absent. Symptoms typically involve thigh/buttock claudication.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1 (Femoropopliteal artery stenosis) (股腘动脉狭窄)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Exercise-induced claudication with rest relief.  
  - Absent right pedal pulses + preserved femoral pulses, localizing stenosis to the femoropopliteal segment.  
  - Atherosclerosis risk factors (diabetes, smoking, hypertension).  
  - Straight leg raise test-induced pallor and pain, indicative of arterial insufficiency.
