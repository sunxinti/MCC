GPT's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Profile:** A 44-year-old African-American woman.  
- **Chief Concern:** Routine examination with anxiety about cancer due to her uncle's death from metastatic melanoma one year ago.  
- **Medical History:** No history of serious illness, no medications.  
- **Occupational and Lifestyle Factors:** Works in a law firm for 20 years, regularly travels to the Caribbean with her husband.  
- **Clinical Findings:** Skin examination reveals no abnormal moles or warts.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Demographics:** African-American ethnicity places her at different risk profiles for melanoma subtypes compared to Caucasian populations.  
- **Family History:** Uncle's death from metastatic melanoma suggests a potential genetic predisposition, increasing her overall risk for melanoma.  
- **Sun Exposure:** Regular travel to the Caribbean indicates significant sun exposure, a known risk factor for melanoma, though no current skin lesions are present.  
- **Skin Examination:** Absence of abnormal moles or warts suggests that melanoma, if present, may not be of a subtype typically associated with numerous moles.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
- **Option 1: Desmoplastic Melanoma**  
  - *Characteristics:* Rare, often occurs on the head and neck, typically in older individuals.  
  - *Relevance:* Unlikely given the patient's age and lack of typical lesion location.  
- **Option 2: Nodular Melanoma**  
  - *Characteristics:* Aggressive, rapid vertical growth, can occur on any skin type but not specifically linked to African-American ethnicity.  
  - *Relevance:* Possible but not the most specific to her demographic.  
- **Option 3: Acral Lentiginous Melanoma**  
  - *Characteristics:* Most common in African-American and Asian populations, occurs on palms, soles, and under nails, often with fewer or no pre-existing moles.  
  - *Relevance:* Highly consistent with the patient's ethnicity and the absence of abnormal moles.  
- **Option 4: Lentigo Maligna Melanoma**  
  - *Characteristics:* Typically occurs in elderly individuals on sun-damaged areas like the face.  
  - *Relevance:* Less likely due to patient's age and lesion distribution.  
- **Option 5: Superficial Spreading Melanoma**  
  - *Characteristics:* Most common in Caucasians, associated with sun-exposed areas and numerous moles.  
  - *Relevance:* Less applicable to African-American individuals and the absence of moles in this patient.

Qwen's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 3 (Acral lentiginous)

Qwen's full response:

**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- A 44-year-old African-American woman with a family history of metastatic melanoma (uncle) seeks evaluation for cancer risk.  
- No personal history of serious illness or medications.  
- Regular travel to the Caribbean.  
- Skin examination reveals no abnormal moles or warts.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Ethnicity**: African-American individuals are at higher risk for **acral lentiginous melanoma**, which typically occurs on non-sun-exposed areas (e.g., palms, soles, nail beds).  
- **Family History**: Melanoma in a first-degree relative (uncle) increases her genetic risk, but the specific subtype depends on other factors.  
- **Sun Exposure**: Caribbean travel may increase UV exposure, but melanoma types like superficial spreading or lentigo maligna are more UV-associated. However, the absence of abnormal moles or sun-damaged skin (e.g., lentigo maligna often appears on sun-exposed areas like the face) weakens these as primary candidates.  
- **Clinical Presentation**: Normal skin exam suggests no visible lesions, which aligns with early-stage or acral lentiginous melanoma (which may lack classic "mole" features).  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Desmoplastic melanoma**: Rare, often linked to sun-damaged skin in older adults. Unlikely in this patient due to age and ethnicity.  
2. **Nodular melanoma**: Aggressive subtype, common in fair-skinned individuals. Less likely in African-American patients.  
3. **Acral lentiginous melanoma**: Most common in people of color, occurs on acral surfaces (e.g., palms/soles). Matches her ethnicity and lack of sun-related lesions.  
4. **Lentigo maligna**: Develops on chronically sun-damaged skin (e.g., face), typically in older adults. Caribbean sun exposure might contribute, but skin exam does not show lentigo maligna features.  
5. **Superficial spreading melanoma**: Most common overall, linked to UV exposure and dysplastic nevi. Less likely in African-American individuals.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Acral lentiginous) (肢端黑素瘤)**

DeepSeek's diagnostic conclusion:
Choice: Option 3 (Acral lentiginous)

DeepSeek's full response:
================================================================================
**1. Case Summary and Key Symptoms**  
- **Patient Profile**: 44-year-old African-American woman, no significant medical history, no medications.  
- **Chief Concern**: Anxiety about melanoma due to family history (uncle died of metastatic melanoma).  
- **Exposure/History**: Indoor occupation (law firm), regular travel to the Caribbean (potential intermittent sun exposure).  
- **Key Clinical Findings**: No abnormal moles or warts on skin examination.  

**2. Analysis of Clinical Features**  
- **Ethnicity**: African-American descent increases risk for acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM), which disproportionately affects individuals with darker skin.  
- **Sun Exposure**: Occupational history (indoor work) suggests limited chronic sun exposure, but Caribbean travel implies intermittent UV exposure. However, ALM is not strongly linked to UV damage.  
- **Absence of Visible Lesions**: Melanoma risk persists despite normal skin exam; ALM often arises in subungual, palmar, or plantar regions, which may be overlooked.  

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis**  
1. **Desmoplastic**: Linked to chronic sun exposure; rare and typically occurs in sun-damaged skin (e.g., head/neck). Less likely due to her age and lack of chronic UV exposure.  
2. **Nodular**: Aggressive, presents as raised lesions; no evidence of nodules here. Ethnicity is not a specific risk factor.  
3. **Acral Lentiginous**: Strongest association with African ancestry. Occurs in acral regions (palms, soles, nail beds), independent of UV exposure. Matches her demographic risk despite normal exam.  
4. **Lentigo Maligna**: Associated with chronic sun damage in elderly individuals (e.g., face). Unlikely given her age and limited cumulative UV exposure.  
5. **Superficial Spreading**: Most common overall subtype, but primarily affects fair-skinned individuals with sun exposure. Less likely in this patient.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3 (Acral lentiginous)(肢端雀斑样黑色素瘤)**  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Ethnicity (African-American) is the strongest risk factor for acral lentiginous melanoma.  
  - ALM arises in sun-protected acral sites (e.g., soles), aligning with her normal skin exam but high-risk demographic.  
  - Family history of melanoma further elevates baseline risk, though subtype specificity is driven by skin type and anatomic distribution.
