================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**
- The question asks to identify which statement about fungi is **NOT true**. It requires evaluating each provided statement against biological knowledge of fungi to determine its accuracy.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**
- **Eukaryotic Nature**: Fungi are eukaryotic organisms, meaning their cells contain a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles.
- **Cell Wall Composition**: Fungal cell walls are primarily composed of chitin, providing rigidity.
- **Growth Form**: Most fungi exhibit a filamentous structure composed of hyphae, which form a mycelium.
- **Photosynthesis**: Photosynthesis is a process used by plants, algae, and some bacteria to convert light energy into chemical energy. Fungi do not perform photosynthesis; they obtain nutrients through absorption.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **They all are eukaryotic.**
   - **Correct**: All fungi are eukaryotic organisms.
2. **They all have rigid cell walls.**
   - **Correct**: Fungi possess rigid cell walls made of chitin.
3. **Most are filamentous.**
   - **Correct**: The majority of fungi have a filamentous structure consisting of hyphae.
4. **Some are photosynthetic.**
   - **Incorrect**: Fungi are not photosynthetic. They are heterotrophic, obtaining nutrients by absorbing them from their environment.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks to identify the statement about fungi that is **not true**. It requires knowledge of fungal biology, including their cellular structure, modes of nutrition, and diversity.  

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Fungal characteristics**: Fungi are eukaryotes with cell walls composed of chitin. They are heterotrophic, obtaining nutrients through absorption.  
- **Cell structure**: All fungi have eukaryotic cells (nuclei and organelles).  
- **Morphology**: Most fungi exist as filamentous networks (hyphae), though some (e.g., yeasts) are unicellular.  
- **Photosynthesis**: Fungi cannot perform photosynthesis; this ability is absent in all fungal species.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **They all are eukaryotic**: True. All fungi have membrane-bound organelles and nuclei, making them eukaryotes.  
2. **They all have rigid cell walls**: True. Fungal cell walls are made of chitin, not cellulose, and provide structural support.  
3. **Most are filamentous**: True. While some fungi (e.g., yeasts) are unicellular, the majority form filamentous hyphae.  
4. **Some are photosynthetic**: **False**. Fungi lack chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is restricted to plants, algae, and cyanobacteria.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  
The statement "Some are photosynthetic" is false because fungi are strictly heterotrophic and do not perform photosynthesis. All other options accurately describe fungal characteristics.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question requires identifying the incorrect statement about fungi. Key concepts include fungal cell structure, nutrition, and morphology.  

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Eukaryotic nature**: All fungi are eukaryotes (membrane-bound organelles).  
- **Cell walls**: Fungal cell walls contain chitin, providing rigidity.  
- **Morphology**: Most fungi grow as multicellular, filamentous hyphae (forming mycelium); exceptions like yeasts are unicellular.  
- **Nutrition**: Fungi are heterotrophs (decomposers or parasites), lacking photosynthetic pigments (e.g., chlorophyll).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: True. All fungi are eukaryotic; no prokaryotic fungi exist.  
- **Option 2**: True. Rigid chitin-based cell walls are a defining fungal trait.  
- **Option 3**: True. Filamentous hyphae characterize most fungi; unicellular yeasts are a minority.  
- **Option 4**: False. Fungi are non-photosynthetic. Photosynthesis is exclusive to plants, algae, and certain bacteria.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The false statement is **Option 4**, as no fungi possess photosynthetic capabilities.  

**My final selection is: Option 4**
