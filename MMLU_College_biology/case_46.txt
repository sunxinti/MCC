**1. Question Analysis**  
The question is asking about the physiological changes in a person's blood when they consciously start breathing rapidly (hyperventilation) while at rest. Specifically, it seeks to identify how hyperventilation affects the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO₂) and the concentration of hydrogen ions (H⁺) in the blood.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Gas Exchange:** Breathing involves the exchange of oxygen (O₂) and carbon dioxide (CO₂) between the lungs and the blood. 
- **Hyperventilation Effects:** When a person hyperventilates, they breathe more rapidly than normal, which leads to excessive expulsion of CO₂ from the bloodstream.
- **Partial Pressure of CO₂ (pCO₂):** This measures the pressure exerted by CO₂ in the blood. Hyperventilation reduces pCO₂ because more CO₂ is being exhaled.
- **Carbonic Acid-Bicarbonate Buffer System:** CO₂ reacts with water in the blood to form carbonic acid (H₂CO₃), which dissociates into bicarbonate ions (HCO₃⁻) and hydrogen ions (H⁺). A decrease in CO₂ lowers the concentration of carbonic acid, thereby reducing H⁺ concentration.
- **Blood pH:** A decrease in H⁺ concentration causes the blood to become more alkaline (increase in pH), a condition known as respiratory alkalosis.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1:** *A decrease in partial pressure of carbon dioxide and an increase in concentration of hydrogen ions*  
  - **pCO₂:** Decrease is correct.  
  - **H⁺ Concentration:** Incorrect; it should decrease due to reduced carbonic acid formation.  
  - **Conclusion:** Incorrect.

- **Option 2:** *A decrease in partial pressure of carbon dioxide and a decrease in concentration of hydrogen ions*  
  - **pCO₂:** Decrease is correct.  
  - **H⁺ Concentration:** Decrease is correct due to reduced carbonic acid.  
  - **Conclusion:** Correct.

- **Option 3:** *An increase in partial pressure of carbon dioxide and an increase in concentration of hydrogen ions*  
  - **pCO₂:** Incorrect; hyperventilation decreases pCO₂.  
  - **H⁺ Concentration:** Incorrect; it decreases.  
  - **Conclusion:** Incorrect.

- **Option 4:** *An increase in partial pressure of carbon dioxide and a decrease in concentration of hydrogen ions*  
  - **pCO₂:** Incorrect; hyperventilation decreases pCO₂.  
  - **H⁺ Concentration:** Decrease is correct, but pCO₂ is incorrect.  
  - **Conclusion:** Incorrect.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question examines the effects of hyperventilation (rapid, deep breathing) on blood chemistry, specifically the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO₂) and hydrogen ion concentration ([H⁺]). It requires understanding the relationship between respiratory rate, CO₂ levels, and acid-base balance in blood.  

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Respiratory Regulation of Blood pH**: CO₂ is a weak acid that dissolves in blood to form carbonic acid (H₂CO₃), which dissociates into H⁺ and bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻). Thus, PCO₂ directly influences [H⁺].  
- **Hyperventilation**: Breathing too rapidly expels excess CO₂, lowering PCO₂. This reduces carbonic acid formation, decreasing [H⁺] and increasing blood pH (respiratory alkalosis).  
- **Immediate Effects**: The question focuses on the direct changes caused by hyperventilation, not compensatory mechanisms (e.g., renal adjustments).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Option 1**: "Decrease in PCO₂ and increase in [H⁺]"  
   - Incorrect. Lower PCO₂ reduces carbonic acid, which should *decrease* [H⁺], not increase it. This contradicts the direct relationship between CO₂ and H⁺.  

2. **Option 2**: "Decrease in PCO₂ and decrease in [H⁺]"  
   - Correct. Hyperventilation lowers PCO₂, reducing carbonic acid dissociation and thus decreasing [H⁺]. This aligns with respiratory alkalosis.  

3. **Option 3**: "Increase in PCO₂ and increase in [H⁺]"  
   - Incorrect. This describes the effects of hypoventilation (retained CO₂), not hyperventilation.  

4. **Option 4**: "Increase in PCO₂ and decrease in [H⁺]"  
   - Incorrect. Increased PCO₂ would raise [H⁺], not lower it. This scenario is physiologically impossible.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  

Hyperventilation directly reduces PCO₂ in the blood. Since CO₂ forms carbonic acid, lower PCO₂ decreases [H⁺], leading to a decrease in hydrogen ion concentration. This matches the principles of respiratory alkalosis, making Option 2 the only biologically accurate choice.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks how hyperventilation (rapid breathing at rest) alters blood chemistry, specifically focusing on changes in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO₂) and hydrogen ion (H⁺) concentration. This relates to respiratory physiology and acid-base balance.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Hyperventilation** increases the rate of CO₂ exhalation, reducing PCO₂ in the blood.  
- CO₂ reacts with water to form carbonic acid (H₂CO₃), which dissociates into H⁺ and bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻). The equilibrium is:  
  $$\text{CO}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{H}_2\text{CO}_3 \leftrightarrow \text{H}^+ + \text{HCO}_3^-$$  
- A **decrease in PCO₂** shifts this equilibrium leftward, reducing H⁺ concentration (alkalosis).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1** (↓PCO₂, ↑H⁺): Incorrect. Reduced CO₂ decreases H⁺ via the equilibrium shift.  
- **Option 2** (↓PCO₂, ↓H⁺): Correct. Hyperventilation expels CO₂, lowering PCO₂ and H⁺ (respiratory alkalosis).  
- **Option 3** (↑PCO₂, ↑H⁺): Incorrect. Hyperventilation lowers PCO₂, and increased H⁺ would occur with hypoventilation.  
- **Option 4** (↑PCO₂, ↓H⁺): Incorrect. Increased PCO₂ would raise H⁺ (acidosis), contradicting the scenario.  

**4. Final Selection**  
Hyperventilation reduces blood CO₂ levels, decreasing H⁺ concentration via the carbonic acid equilibrium. This matches **Option 2**.  

**My final selection is: Option 2**
