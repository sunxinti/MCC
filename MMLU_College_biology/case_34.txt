**1. Question Analysis**  
- **Topic:** The question focuses on understanding DNA base pairing and determining the complementary DNA strand.
- **Task:** Identify the correct complementary sequence to the given DNA strand 5′ CGA TTG 3′ from the provided options.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **DNA Base Pairing Rules:** In DNA, adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T), and cytosine (C) pairs with guanine (G).
- **Antiparallel Strands:** DNA strands run in opposite directions; thus, the complementary strand is antiparallel to the original.
- **Directionality:** The original strand is given in the 5′ to 3′ direction, and the complementary strand should also be presented in the 5′ to 3′ direction for comparison.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Original Sequence:** 5′ CGA TTG 3′
  
  To find the complementary strand:
  - C → G
  - G → C
  - A → T
  - T → A
  - T → A
  - G → C

  This gives the complementary sequence: GCT AAC. However, since DNA strands are antiparallel, the complementary strand in the 5′ to 3′ direction would be the reverse: CAA TCG.

- **Option 1:** 5′ GCU AAC 3′  
  - Contains 'U', which is found in RNA, not DNA. **Incorrect.**
  
- **Option 2:** 5′ GCT AAC 3′  
  - Matches the immediate complement but does not account for the antiparallel orientation. **Incorrect.**
  
- **Option 3:** 5′ GTT AGC 3′  
  - Does not correctly pair the bases. **Incorrect.**
  
- **Option 4:** 5′ CAA TCG 3′  
  - Correctly represents the complementary strand in the 5′ to 3′ direction. **Correct.**

**4. Final Selection**

================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this DNA complement question. The question is asking for the complementary DNA strand of the given 5′ CGA TTG 3′ sequence. Hmm, I need to remember how DNA base pairing works. 

First, DNA strands are antiparallel, right? So the complementary strand should run in the 3' to 5' direction. But the options here are all written 5' to 3', so I have to make sure that when I find the complement, the direction is correct. Wait, actually, the question says "complementary to the sequence," so the given sequence is one strand, and the options are the other strand's sequence. Since DNA is antiparallel, the complementary strand's sequence should be written in the opposite direction. But the options are all 5' to 3', so I need to reverse the original sequence and then complement each base. 

Let me break it down. The original sequence is 5' CGA TTG 3'. To find the complementary strand, first, the bases pair as follows: C with G, G with C, A with T, T with A, and G with C. Wait, but since the strands are antiparallel, the complementary strand is synthesized in the 3' to 5' direction. So the complementary strand's sequence, when written from 5' to 3', should be the reverse complement of the original. 

Let me write the original strand as 5' C G A T T G 3'. The complementary bases would be G C T A A C. But since the complementary strand is in the opposite direction, the sequence from 5' to 3' would be the reverse of that. Wait, no. Let me think again. The original is 5' to 3', so the complementary strand is 3' to 5', so when written as 5' to 3', it's the reverse of the complement. 

So, step by step: 

Original strand: 5' C G A T T G 3'

Complementary bases (pairing each base):

C pairs with G

G pairs with C

A pairs with T

T pairs with A

G pairs with C

So the complementary bases in order (from 3' to 5') would be G C T A A C. But since the complementary strand is written from 5' to 3', we need to reverse that sequence. Wait, no. The complementary strand's 5' end is the start of the reverse. 

Let me think of it this way: the original is 5' to 3', so the complementary strand is 3' to 5', but when written in the standard 5' to 3', it's the reverse of the complement. 

So the original is C G A T T G (5' to 3'). The complement of each base is G C T A A C (3' to 5' direction). To write this as 5' to 3', you reverse the sequence, so it becomes C A A T G C. Wait, no. Wait, the complement of the original sequence (each base paired) would be GCTAAC (since each base is complemented). But the direction is reversed. Let me do it step by step. 

Original sequence: positions 1 (5') C, then G, A, T, T, G, ending at 3'. The complementary strand must pair with each base, so each position's complement is:

Position 1 (C) pairs with G (on the complementary strand's position 6, which is the 3' end of the complementary strand). 

So the complementary strand's sequence from 5' to 3' would be the reverse of the complement sequence. Let me write the complement first. 

Original: 5' C G A T T G 3'

Complement (written in the same direction as the original, but that's not correct because they are antiparallel). Wait, actually, the complementary strand is antiparallel, so to get the correct sequence, you reverse the original sequence and then take the complement of each base. 

Wait, perhaps the correct method is: to get the complementary strand in the same 5' to 3' direction as the original, you need to reverse the original sequence and then take the complement of each base. 

Wait, let me think again. Let me consider a simple example. Suppose the original is 5' ATGC 3', then the complementary strand is 3' TACG 5', which when written as 5' to 3' would be CGAT. 

So the method is: reverse the original sequence, then take each base's complement. 

Wait, no. Wait, in the example: original is ATGC (5' to 3'), complementary is CGAT (5' to 3'). 

So to get the complementary strand's 5' to 3' sequence, you reverse the original sequence (GCAT) and then take the complement of each base (GCAT reversed is TACG, but no, wait). Wait, maybe the correct process is to reverse the original and then take the complement of each base. Let me do that with the example:

Original: ATGC (5' to 3')

Reverse the original: CGTA (3' to 5') 

Then take the complement of each base: CGTA becomes GACT? Wait, no. Wait, the complement of each base in the reversed sequence. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing steps here. Let me think again. 

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to take each base in the original, pair them, and since the complementary strand is antiparallel, the sequence is the reverse complement. 

So for the original 5' CGA TTG 3', the reverse of the sequence is G T T A G C (since reversing the order of the bases). Then take the complement of each base in this reversed sequence. 

Wait, let's do it step by step. 

Original sequence: 5' C G A T T G 3'

Reverse the order of the bases: G T T A G C (this is the original sequence in reverse)

Now take the complement of each base in this reversed sequence:

G becomes C,

T becomes A,

T becomes A,

A becomes T,

G becomes C,

C becomes G.

Wait, so the reversed sequence is G T T A G C. Taking each base's complement:

G → C,

T → A,

T → A,

A → T,

G → C,

C → G.

So the complement of the reversed sequence is C A A T C G. 

Wait, that gives the complementary strand as 5' C A A T C G 3'? But the options don't have that. Let me check the options again. 

Wait, the options are:

1. 5′ GCU AAC 3′

Wait, the question is about DNA, so all the options should be DNA, so they should have T instead of U. Wait, looking at the options:

Option 1: GCU AAC. That's RNA because of the U. Since the question is about DNA, this can't be correct. So option 1 is out. 

Option 2: GCT AAC. That's DNA, since T is present. 

Option 3: GTT AGC. Also DNA. 

Option4: CAA TCG. DNA as well. 

So first, eliminate option 1 because it has U. 

Now, let's recalculate properly. Maybe I made a mistake in the steps.

Original DNA strand: 5' CGA TTG 3'. Let's write the bases in order:

Positions: 1 (5') C, 2 G, 3 A, 4 T, 5 T, 6 G (3').

The complementary strand must pair with each base, so the bases are:

Position 1 (C) pairs with G (on complementary strand's position 6, which is the 3' end of complementary). 

Position 2 (G) pairs with C (position 5 of complementary). 

Position 3 (A) pairs with T (position 4 of complementary). 

Position4 (T) pairs with A (position3). 

Position5 (T) pairs with A (position2). 

Position6 (G) pairs with C (position1 of complementary). 

So the complementary strand's bases from 5' to 3' would be the reverse of the original's bases, with each base complemented. 

Original sequence: C G A T T G 

Reverse the original sequence: G T T A G C 

Now, take complement of each base in the reversed sequence:

G → C,

T → A,

T → A,

A → T,

G → C,

C → G.

So the complementary strand's sequence is C A A T C G. 

Wait, so that would be 5' C A A T C G 3', which is CAA TCG. That's option 4? Let me check the options again. 

Options:

4. 5′ CAA TCG 3′. 

Yes, that's exactly C-A-A-T-C-G. So that's the correct one. 

Wait, but let me check the other options again. 

Option 2: GCT AAC. Let's see. That would be G C T A A C. 

Wait, how did I get that? Let me see where I might have gone wrong. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in reversing the sequence. Let me do this again step by step. 

Original sequence: 5' C G A T T G 3'

The complementary DNA strand must be antiparallel, so the sequence is the reverse complement. 

So first, write the complement of each base in the original sequence, keeping the same order (this would be the sequence in the 3' to 5' direction, since it's complementary). 

Original: C G A T T G 

Complement: G C T A A C (since C→G, G→C, A→T, T→A, T→A, G→C)

Now, the complementary strand's 5' to 3' direction is the reverse of this complement. 

The complement sequence is G C T A A C (written in 3' to 5'), so reversing it gives C A A T G C. Wait, that would be C A A T G C. 

Wait, that's different from before. Hmm, confusion here. Let me clarify. 

The original is 5' to 3', so the complementary strand is 3' to 5'. 

If I take the complement of each base in the original, that gives me the sequence of the complementary strand in the same direction (so 3' to 5'). To write it in 5' to 3', you reverse it. 

So the complement of the original is GCTAAC (written in 3' to 5'), so reversing that gives CAA TGC? Wait, no. Wait, let's write it step by step:

Original DNA: 5' C G A T T G 3'

Complementary bases (same direction as original, but that's not the strand's direction):

Each base pairs as:

C pairs with G (so complementary base is G at that position, but that's on the complementary strand's 3' end). 

So the complementary strand's sequence, when written from 3' to 5', would be G C T A A C. 

To write the complementary strand in the 5' to 3' direction, you reverse that sequence. 

So reversing GCTAAC (which is 3' to 5') gives CAA TGC? Wait, no. Let's take the letters: G C T A A C. Reversed is C A A T G C. Wait, that's 6 letters. 

Wait, original is 6 bases: C G A T T G. So the complement is 6 bases: G C T A A C. Reversing that gives C A A T G C. But that would be the 5' to 3' direction. 

Wait but according to this, the complementary strand would be CAA TGC. But none of the options have that. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. 

Alternatively, perhaps I should have reversed the original sequence first, then taken the complement. Let's try that way. 

Original sequence: 5' C G A T T G 3'

Reverse the original sequence: G T T A G C (3' to 5')

Now take the complement of each base in this reversed sequence:

G → C,

T → A,

T → A,

A → T,

G → C,

C → G.

So the complementary strand's sequence is C A A T C G. 

Which is CAA TCG. That's option 4. 

Ah, so that's the correct one. 

Wait, so perhaps my confusion was in the steps. The correct method is to reverse the original sequence and then take the complement of each base. 

So the steps are: 

1. Reverse the original DNA sequence (so the order is reversed).

2. Then, take the complement of each individual base in this reversed sequence. 

This gives the sequence of the complementary strand in the 5' to 3' direction. 

So applying that to the original sequence:

Original: C G A T T G (5' to 3')

Reverse: G T T A G C 

Complement each base: 

G → C,

T → A,

T → A,

A → T,

G → C,

C → G. 

So the resulting sequence is C A A T C G → CAA TCG, which is option 4. 

Wait, but let me check the other options again. 

Option 2 is GCT AAC. That would be G C T A A C. Which is the complement of the original without reversing. 

Option3 is GTT AGC: G T T A G C. That's the reversed original, but not complemented. 

Option4 is CAA TCG, which is C A A T C G. Which matches the correct

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks for the complementary DNA sequence to a given DNA strand (5′ CGA TTG 3′). This requires understanding base-pairing rules (A-T, C-G) and the antiparallel nature of DNA strands, where the complementary strand runs in the opposite direction (5′→3′ vs. 3′→5′).  

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Base Pairing**: In DNA, adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T), and cytosine (C) pairs with guanine (G).  
- **Antiparallel Orientation**: The complementary strand is synthesized in the reverse direction. For example, a 5′→3′ template produces a 3′→5′ complementary strand. When written in the standard 5′→3′ direction, the complementary sequence must be reversed.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (5′ GCU AAC 3′)**: Contains uracil (U), which is characteristic of RNA, not DNA. Incorrect.  
- **Option 2 (5′ GCT AAC 3′)**: Matches the immediate complement of the original strand (GCT AAC) but fails to account for antiparallel orientation. The original strand is 5′ CGA TTG 3′, so the complementary strand must be reversed to 5′ CAA TCG 3′. Incorrect.  
- **Option 3 (5′ GTT AGC 3′)**: Incorrect base pairing. For example, the third base (A) in the original pairs with T, but this option incorrectly uses T→G. Incorrect.  
- **Option 4 (5′ CAA TCG 3′)**: Correctly applies base pairing and reverses the sequence to account for antiparallel orientation. The original sequence (CGA TTG) pairs as GCT AAC in 3′→5′, which, when reversed, becomes 5′ CAA TCG 3′. Correct.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  
This option adheres to DNA base-pairing rules and correctly reverses the sequence to maintain the antiparallel structure of DNA. Options 1 and 3 violate base-pairing or strand orientation, while Option 2 lacks the required reversal.
