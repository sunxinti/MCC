**1. Question Analysis**
- The question is asking which group of animals was the first to develop lung tissue sufficient to meet their respiratory needs without relying on additional gas exchange mechanisms. This involves understanding the evolution of respiratory systems in different animal groups.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**
- **Respiratory Systems Evolution**: Early vertebrates primarily used gills for gas exchange. As environments changed, especially with the colonization of terrestrial habitats, the evolution of lungs became advantageous.
- **Amphibians**: Possess lungs but still rely significantly on skin (cutaneous respiration) for gas exchange.
- **Reptiles**: Developed more efficient lungs and a tougher skin barrier, reducing dependency on cutaneous respiration, making their lungs sufficient for gas exchange without supplementary organs.
- **Mammals**: Have highly efficient lungs but evolved after reptiles.
- **Trematoda**: These are flatworms that rely on diffusion across their body surfaces for gas exchange and do not possess specialized lung tissues.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Amphibians**: While amphibians have lungs, they still depend on their skin for a significant portion of their gas exchange. Therefore, their lungs alone are not fully adequate to support their respiratory requirements without supplementary gas exchange methods.
2. **Reptiles**: Reptiles developed more advanced and efficient lungs compared to amphibians. Their anatomical adaptations, such as stronger muscular diaphragms and more complex lung structures, allow them to breathe effectively without relying on their skin or other supplementary organs.
3. **Mammals**: Mammals possess highly efficient lungs, but they evolved after reptiles. Therefore, they are not the first group to have developed lungs adequate on their own.
4. **Trematoda**: These flatworms do not have specialized respiratory organs like lungs and rely entirely on diffusion, making them unsuitable as the correct answer.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which animal group first evolved lungs sufficient for respiration without relying on additional gas exchange organs (e.g., gills or skin). This requires understanding the evolutionary timeline of vertebrate respiratory systems and the transition from aquatic to terrestrial life.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Evolution of Respiration**: Early vertebrates (e.g., fish) relied on gills. As vertebrates moved to land, lungs evolved for air breathing. However, some early terrestrial vertebrates retained supplementary gas exchange mechanisms (e.g., skin or gills).  
- **Amphibians**: Modern amphibians (e.g., frogs) have lungs but also use their moist skin for gas exchange. Their ancestors (e.g., early tetrapods) may have had underdeveloped lungs and relied more on skin respiration.  
- **Reptiles**: Reptiles evolved more efficient lungs and a watertight skin, reducing reliance on cutaneous respiration. Their eggs also have membranes that facilitate gas exchange, supporting fully terrestrial life.  
- **Mammals**: Mammals inherited and refined the lung structure from reptiles but appeared later in evolutionary history.  
- **Trematoda**: These are parasitic flatworms (e.g., liver flukes) that lack lungs entirely and rely on diffusion across their body surface.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Amphibians)**: Incorrect. Amphibians retain supplementary gas exchange via their skin and often require moist environments. Their lungs are not fully sufficient to eliminate the need for cutaneous respiration.  
- **Option 2 (Reptiles)**: Correct. Reptiles evolved the first fully functional lungs capable of meeting all respiratory needs without relying on skin or other organs. Their adaptations (e.g., efficient lungs, scaly skin) enabled fully terrestrial life.  
- **Option 3 (Mammals)**: Incorrect. While mammals have advanced lungs, they evolved after reptiles. The question asks for the *first* group to achieve this trait.  
- **Option 4 (Trematoda)**: Incorrect. Trematoda are invertebrates without lungs. They rely solely on diffusion, making them irrelevant to the question.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  

Reptiles were the first vertebrate group to evolve lungs adequate for all respiratory needs without supplementary organs. Their adaptations allowed them to become fully terrestrial, unlike amphibians, which still depend on skin respiration. Mammals, while more derived, appeared later, and Trematoda lack lungs entirely.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which animal group first evolved lungs capable of meeting their respiratory needs independently, without relying on supplementary organs (e.g., gills, skin) for gas exchange. This requires understanding the evolutionary adaptations of respiratory systems in vertebrates.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Amphibians**: Primarily use lungs but also rely on cutaneous respiration (skin) and buccal pumping. Their lungs are relatively simple sacs with limited surface area, insufficient for full gas exchange without skin supplementation.  
- **Reptiles**: Evolved more complex lungs with internal folding (e.g., faveoli in some species), enabling greater surface area for gas exchange. Their dry, keratinized skin prevents cutaneous respiration, forcing reliance on lungs alone.  
- **Mammals**: Possess highly efficient alveolar lungs but evolved after reptiles. Their respiratory adaptations are derived from reptilian ancestors.  
- **Trematoda (Flatworms)**: Lack lungs entirely; gas exchange occurs via diffusion through their body surface.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Amphibians)**: Incorrect. Amphibians require supplementary cutaneous respiration, especially during aquatic larval stages and in adulthood for some species.  
- **Option 2 (Reptiles)**: Correct. Reptiles were the first to rely solely on lungs due to their impermeable skin and structurally advanced lung tissue.  
- **Option 3 (Mammals)**: Incorrect. Mammals evolved later and inherited lung efficiency from reptilian ancestors.  
- **Option 4 (Trematoda)**: Incorrect. Trematodes lack lungs entirely and do not represent terrestrial vertebrates.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  
Reptiles were the first vertebrates to develop lungs sufficiently specialized to meet respiratory demands independently, as their impermeable skin eliminated cutaneous respiration, necessitating lung evolution for terrestrial survival. This adaptation preceded the emergence of mammals and contrasts with amphibians, which retained reliance on supplementary gas exchange.
