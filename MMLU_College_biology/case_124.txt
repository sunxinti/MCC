**1. Question Analysis**
- The question is asking about the characteristics of a behavioral response known as a fixed action pattern (FAP) in animals. It requires identifying which option accurately describes the nature of FAPs based on biological principles.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**
- **Fixed Action Patterns (FAPs):** FAPs are innate, stereotyped behaviors that are triggered by specific stimuli called sign stimuli or releasers. Once initiated, these behaviors are carried out to completion without the need for further sensory input.
- **Innate vs. Learned Behavior:** FAPs are innate and not learned through experience, contrasting with behaviors that require learning or conditioning.
- **Sensory Feedback:** While the initial trigger for a FAP is sensory, the behavior itself does not rely on ongoing sensory feedback once initiated.
- **Termination of Behavior:** FAPs generally run to completion unless interrupted by external factors, rather than being terminated spontaneously.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Occurs the second time an animal is exposed to the correct stimulus at the appropriate time in its life**
   - **Incorrect:** This description aligns more with learned behaviors or habituation rather than FAPs, which are innate and not dependent on repeated exposure.
2. **Occurs in the absence of sensory feedback**
   - **Correct:** FAPs are executed once triggered without the need for further sensory input, making this an accurate description.
3. **Is a motor response which once released may be terminated spontaneously**
   - **Incorrect:** FAPs typically run to completion and are not usually terminated spontaneously; they proceed until the behavior sequence is finished.
4. **Is triggered by a number of sensory signals in the animal's environment**
   - **Incorrect:** FAPs are usually triggered by a specific stimulus rather than multiple sensory signals.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks about the defining characteristics of a fixed action pattern (FAP), a type of innate behavior. Key aspects to consider include the nature of FAPs, their triggers, and their execution.  

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
Fixed action patterns are stereotyped, unlearned behaviors triggered by a specific sensory stimulus (called a **sign stimulus**). Once initiated, FAPs proceed to completion **independently of ongoing sensory feedback**. They do not require prior experience or learning, and they cannot be interrupted or altered mid-execution even if the initial stimulus is removed.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Incorrect. FAPs are innate and occur the **first time** an animal is exposed to the appropriate stimulus, not the second time. Prior exposure is not required.  
- **Option 2**: Correct. FAPs proceed to completion **without requiring continuous sensory feedback** after initiation. Even if the triggering stimulus disappears, the behavior continues.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. FAPs are **irreversible once initiated**; they cannot be terminated spontaneously until completion.  
- **Option 4**: Incorrect. FAPs are triggered by a **specific sign stimulus**, not multiple or variable sensory signals.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  

**Explanation**: Fixed action patterns are stereotyped behaviors that, once triggered by a specific stimulus, proceed to completion **without relying on ongoing sensory feedback**. This matches the description in Option 2. The other options either misrepresent the role of prior exposure (Option 1), incorrectly suggest spontaneity in termination (Option 3), or imply variability in triggering stimuli (Option 4), which contradict the definition of FAPs.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks about identifying the correct description of a fixed action pattern (FAP), a type of innate, stereotyped animal behavior. Key concepts include the trigger mechanism, execution without feedback, and termination characteristics of FAPs.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Fixed Action Patterns (FAPs):** Innate, sequence-driven behaviors triggered by a specific stimulus (sign stimulus). Once initiated, they run to completion without requiring sensory feedback.  
- **Sign Stimulus:** A specific environmental cue that releases the FAP (e.g., the sight of an egg outside a nest triggers egg-retrieval in geese).  
- **Sensory Feedback Independence:** FAPs are "ballistic"; their execution does not depend on ongoing sensory input.  
- **Termination:** FAPs typically complete their full sequence even if the stimulus is removed mid-action.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1:** Incorrect. FAPs occur upon the *first* exposure to the correct stimulus, not the second. They are innate and do not require prior learning.  
- **Option 2:** Correct. FAPs proceed without reliance on sensory feedback during execution. For example, a dog shaking off water continues the motion even after most water is removed.  
- **Option 3:** Incorrect. FAPs are not terminated spontaneously; they persist until completion (e.g., a goose continues egg-rolling even if the egg is removed).  
- **Option 4:** Incorrect. FAPs are triggered by a *specific* sign stimulus, not multiple environmental signals.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The most accurate answer is **Option 2**, as FAPs are executed independently of sensory feedback once initiated, aligning with their innate, stereotyped nature.  

**My final selection is: Option 2**
