================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is assessing the fundamental requirements for evolution to occur. Specifically, it asks which statement must be true to confirm that evolution has taken place. This revolves around understanding the mechanisms and evidence of evolutionary change in biological populations.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Definition of Evolution**: Evolution is defined as a change in the genetic composition of a population over successive generations. This typically involves changes in allele frequencies within the gene pool.
- **Allele Frequency**: The proportion of different alleles of a gene present in a population's gene pool.
- **Population vs. Individual**: Evolutionary changes occur at the population level over generations, not within an individual's lifetime.
- **Mechanisms of Evolution**: Includes natural selection, genetic drift, mutation, and gene flow, all of which can alter allele frequencies.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: *The frequencies of some alleles in a population's gene pool has changed over successive generations.*
  - **Evaluation**: This directly aligns with the definition of evolution, where changes in allele frequencies over generations indicate evolutionary processes.
  - **Conclusion**: Correct.
  
- **Option 2**: *The frequencies of some alleles in a population's gene pool has changed during the organisms' lifetimes.*
  - **Evaluation**: Evolution pertains to changes across generations, not within the lifespan of individual organisms. While mutations can occur within a lifetime, evolution requires the passage and prevalence of these changes across generations.
  - **Conclusion**: Incorrect.
  
- **Option 3**: *The frequencies of each allele in a population's gene pool has remained constant over successive generations.*
  - **Evaluation**: This statement describes a scenario where no evolution is occurring, as there are no changes in allele frequencies.
  - **Conclusion**: Incorrect.
  
- **Option 4**: *The frequencies of each allele in an organism's genotype has remained constant within the organism's lifetime.*
  - **Evaluation**: Evolution is concerned with population-level changes over generations, not with allele frequencies within a single organism's genotype over its lifespan.
  - **Conclusion**: Incorrect.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which condition is necessary for evolution to occur. Evolution is defined as a change in the genetic composition of a population over time. The key is identifying the biological criterion that directly aligns with this definition.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Evolution Definition**: Evolution occurs when allele frequencies in a population’s gene pool change over successive generations.  
- **Population-Level Change**: Evolution acts on populations, not individuals. Changes within an organism’s lifetime (e.g., due to mutation in somatic cells) do not contribute to evolution.  
- **Allele Frequency Shift**: For evolution to occur, at least some alleles must increase or decrease in frequency across generations.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Correct. This directly matches the definition of evolution. A change in allele frequencies over generations is the hallmark of evolution.  
- **Option 2**: Incorrect. Evolution occurs across generations, not within an organism’s lifetime. Even if alleles change during an organism’s life (e.g., somatic mutations), these do not affect the gene pool of the population.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. Constant allele frequencies mean no evolution has occurred. This contradicts the requirement for evolution.  
- **Option 4**: Incorrect. This refers to an individual’s genotype stability, which is irrelevant to population-level evolutionary changes.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**  

This option is correct because evolution fundamentally requires changes in allele frequencies in a population’s gene pool over generations. The other options either misrepresent the scope (individual vs. population) or direction (stasis vs. change) of evolutionary processes.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks which condition must be true for evolution to have occurred. Evolution is fundamentally tied to changes in genetic composition within populations over time. The correct answer must align with the biological definition of evolution.  

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Evolution** is defined as a change in the allele frequencies of a population’s gene pool over successive generations (microevolution).  
- **Allele frequencies** reflect the proportion of different alleles for a gene in a population. Evolution occurs when these frequencies shift due to mechanisms like natural selection, genetic drift, mutation, gene flow, or non-random mating.  
- **Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium** describes a theoretical scenario where allele frequencies remain constant across generations (no evolution). Deviations from this equilibrium indicate evolution.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: "The frequencies of some alleles in a population's gene pool has changed over successive generations."  
  - **Correct**. Evolution requires at least one allele’s frequency to change between generations. This aligns with the definition of evolution.  
- **Option 2**: "The frequencies of some alleles in a population's gene pool has changed during the organisms' lifetimes."  
  - **Incorrect**. Evolution occurs across generations, not within an individual’s lifetime. Allele frequencies in a population are measured at the population level over time, not during an organism’s lifespan.  
- **Option 3**: "The frequencies of each allele in a population's gene pool has remained constant over successive generations."  
  - **Incorrect**. This describes Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (no evolution). If true, evolution has *not* occurred.  
- **Option 4**: "The frequencies of each allele in an organism's genotype has remained constant within the organism's lifetime."  
  - **Incorrect**. An organism’s genotype is fixed at conception (barring mutations). This is irrelevant to evolution, which operates at the population level, not within individual lifetimes.  

**4. Final Selection**  
- Evolution is defined by changes in allele frequencies in a population over generations. Only **Option 1** directly reflects this requirement. The other options either misapply the concept to individual lifetimes (Options 2, 4) or contradict the premise of evolution (Option 3).  

**My final selection is: Option 1**
