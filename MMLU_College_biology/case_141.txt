**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question focuses on the role of proton pumps in plants, specifically regarding the loading of sugars into the phloem for transport. It seeks to identify the accurate statement about this process from the provided options.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Phloem Loading:** This is the process by which sugars (primarily sucrose) are actively transported into the phloem sieve tubes for distribution throughout the plant.
- **Proton Pumps:** In plant cells, proton pumps (H⁺-ATPases) are located in the plasma membrane and utilize energy from ATP to pump protons (H⁺ ions) out of the cell.
- **Active Transport:** The proton gradient created by proton pumps is used to drive the co-transport of sugars into the phloem via symporters. This is an example of active transport because it requires energy to move substances against their concentration gradient.
- **Energy Requirement:** Active transport processes, such as phloem loading, depend on ATP to function.
- **Translocation of Substances:** While the phloem transports sugars, starch is typically a storage form of carbohydrates and is not directly translocated through the phloem.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **It is passive.**  
   - *Incorrect.* The process of loading sugars into the phloem via proton pumps is an active process, not passive, because it requires energy input (ATP).

2. **It depends on DNA.**  
   - *Incorrect.* While the synthesis of proton pumps is genetically encoded, the immediate process of sugar loading into the phloem does not directly depend on DNA activity.

3. **It requires ATP.**  
   - *Correct.* Proton pumps use ATP to create the proton gradient necessary for the active transport of sugars into the phloem.

4. **It translocates starch.**  
   - *Incorrect.* The phloem primarily translocates sugars like sucrose, not starch. Starch is a storage carbohydrate and is typically broken down into sugars before transport.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question focuses on the role of proton pumps in the process of sugar loading into the phloem in plants. The key concepts involve understanding transport mechanisms (active vs. passive), the function of proton pumps, and the biological processes involved in phloem transport.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Proton Pumps**: These are membrane proteins that actively transport protons (H⁺) across a membrane, typically using ATP. This creates a proton gradient, which can drive secondary active transport (cotransport) of other molecules.  
- **Phloem Sugar Loading**: Phloem transport is driven by active loading of sugars (e.g., sucrose) into sieve tube elements. This process often relies on proton gradients established by proton pumps to move sugars against their concentration gradient via symport proteins.  
- **ATP Requirement**: Since proton pumps directly hydrolyze ATP to move protons, any process dependent on these pumps inherently requires ATP.  
- **Starch vs. Sucrose**: Starch is a storage polysaccharide, while sucrose is the primary transported sugar in phloem.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **It is passive**: Incorrect. Sugar loading into the phloem is **active**, as it moves sugars against their concentration gradient. Passive transport does not require energy and moves with the gradient.  
2. **It depends on DNA**: Incorrect. While DNA encodes the genes for proton pumps and transport proteins, the process of sugar loading itself does not directly require DNA in real-time. It relies on protein function, not ongoing DNA activity.  
3. **It requires ATP**: **Correct**. Proton pumps directly use ATP to establish the proton gradient necessary for sugar transport. This makes the overall process ATP-dependent.  
4. **It translocates starch**: Incorrect. The phloem primarily transports **sucrose**, not starch. Starch is stored in plastids and is not involved in phloem transport.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  
The process of loading sugars into the phloem requires ATP because proton pumps, which hydrolyze ATP, are essential for generating the proton gradient that drives sugar transport via symport mechanisms. This makes the process active, not passive, and directly dependent on ATP. Other options are incorrect due to misrepresentations of the transport mechanism, energy requirements, or transported molecules.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which statement is true regarding the role of proton pumps in sugar loading into the phloem. This involves understanding the mechanism of phloem loading, specifically the energy requirements and molecular processes involved.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Phloem loading** is an **active transport** process where sucrose is transported into sieve-tube elements against its concentration gradient.  
- **Proton pumps** (H⁺-ATPases) hydrolyze ATP to pump protons (H⁺) out of the cell, creating an electrochemical gradient. This gradient drives sucrose uptake via **co-transporters** (H⁺-sucrose symporters).  
- **ATP is required** to power proton pumps, making the process energy-dependent.  
- Passive transport does not require energy, but phloem loading is active. DNA is not directly involved in the transport mechanism itself, and starch is not translocated in the phloem (sucrose is the transport sugar).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: It is passive.**  
  Incorrect. Proton pumps establish a gradient through ATP hydrolysis, and sucrose loading via symporters relies on this gradient. Both steps require energy, making the process active.  

- **Option 2: It depends on DNA.**  
  Incorrect. While DNA encodes proton pumps and symporters, the direct mechanism of sugar loading does not depend on DNA during transport. DNA’s role is indirect (protein synthesis), not a direct requirement for the process.  

- **Option 3: It requires ATP.**  
  Correct. Proton pumps are ATP-dependent enzymes. ATP hydrolysis provides energy to create the proton gradient, which is essential for sucrose co-transport.  

- **Option 4: It translocates starch.**  
  Incorrect. Starch is a storage polysaccharide and is not transported in the phloem. Sucrose is the primary sugar translocated.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The process of phloem loading via proton pumps is energy-dependent, requiring ATP to establish the proton gradient necessary for sucrose transport.  

**My final selection is: Option 3**
