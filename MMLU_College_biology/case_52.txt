**1. Question Analysis**

The question pertains to plant embryogenesis, specifically asking which of the provided statements is **incorrect** ("EXCEPT"). Plant embryogenesis involves the development of a plant embryo within a seed, encompassing processes like the formation of the suspensor, cotyledons, shoot apical meristem, and the establishment of plant tissue systems.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**

- **Suspensor Development:** In plant embryos, the suspensor is a structure that connects the embryo to the surrounding nutritive tissue. It is typically derived from the basal cell.

- **Cotyledon Formation:** Cotyledons are the embryonic leaves of a plant and are generally derived from the apical cell of the embryo.

- **Shoot Apical Meristem (SAM):** The SAM is a critical region in plant embryos responsible for the growth of new tissues. It forms during embryogenesis, prior to seed maturation.

- **Plant Tissue Systems:** Plants have three primary tissue systems—dermal, vascular, and ground tissues. The precursors for all these systems are established during embryogenesis.

**3. Analysis of Options**

1. **The suspensor is derived from the basal cell.**
   - **Correct.** The suspensor typically originates from the basal cell during embryogenesis.

2. **Cotyledons are derived from the apical cell.**
   - **Correct.** Cotyledons develop from the apical region of the embryo.

3. **Shoot apical meristem formation occurs after seed formation.**
   - **Incorrect.** The shoot apical meristem forms **during** embryogenesis, which is part of seed development, not after seed formation.

4. **Precursors of all three plant tissue systems are formed during embryogenesis.**
   - **Correct.** Dermal, vascular, and ground tissue systems have their precursors established during the embryonic stage.

**4. Final Selection**

**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks to identify the incorrect statement about plant embryogenesis. It requires knowledge of key developmental stages and structures formed during embryo formation in plants, such as the suspensor, cotyledons, shoot apical meristem, and tissue system precursors.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Suspensor**: Derived from the basal cell after the first division of the zygote, anchoring the embryo and facilitating nutrient transfer.  
- **Cotyledons**: Formed from the apical cell, which gives rise to the shoot system.  
- **Shoot Apical Meristem (SAM)**: Develops during embryogenesis as part of the embryo itself, not after seed formation.  
- **Tissue Systems**: All three plant tissue systems (dermal, ground, vascular) originate from embryonic precursor cells established during embryogenesis.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Correct. The suspensor is indeed derived from the basal cell, which is a well-established fact in plant embryology.  
- **Option 2**: Correct. Cotyledons arise from the apical cell, which also forms the shoot apex.  
- **Option 3**: **Incorrect**. The shoot apical meristem forms *during* embryogenesis, not after seed formation. The seed matures around the embryo, so the SAM is already present in the embryo before the seed is fully developed.  
- **Option 4**: Correct. Embryogenesis establishes precursors for all three tissue systems (e.g., procambium for vascular tissue, protoderm for dermal tissue, and ground tissue layers).  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question tests understanding of plant embryogenesis processes, focusing on identifying the incorrect statement about developmental events and structures (e.g., suspensor, cotyledons, shoot apical meristem, tissue systems).  

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Embryogenesis**: The zygote divides into an **apical cell** (forms the embryo proper, including cotyledons and shoot/root meristems) and a **basal cell** (forms the **suspensor**).  
- **Meristem formation**: Shoot apical meristem (SAM) and root apical meristem (RAM) are established **during embryogenesis**, prior to seed maturation.  
- **Tissue systems**: Protoderm (dermal), ground meristem (ground tissue), and procambium (vascular) precursors develop in the embryo.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Correct. The suspensor is derived from the basal cell, which anchors the embryo and facilitates nutrient transfer.  
- **Option 2**: Correct. Cotyledons (embryonic leaves) originate from the apical cell lineage, part of the embryo proper.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. SAM formation occurs **during embryogenesis**, not after seed formation. The SAM is already present in the mature embryo within the seed.  
- **Option 4**: Correct. All three tissue systems (dermal, vascular, ground) are initiated during embryogenesis via specialized meristems.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The incorrect statement is **Option 3**, as shoot apical meristem formation is a key event of embryogenesis, completed before seed maturation.  

**My final selection is: Option 3**
