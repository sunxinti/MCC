**1. Question Analysis**
- The question is inquiring about which specific tissue in an actively photosynthesizing plant exhibits the highest rate of oxygen production. This requires understanding the roles of various plant tissues and identifying which is most involved in the photosynthetic process that generates oxygen.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**
- **Photosynthesis Process**: Photosynthesis primarily occurs in the chloroplast-containing cells of plant leaves, where light energy is converted into chemical energy, producing oxygen as a byproduct.
- **Leaf Anatomy**: 
  - The **palisade mesophyll** is composed of tightly packed, elongated cells rich in chloroplasts, making it the primary site for photosynthesis.
  - The **cortex** is a general tissue in stems and roots involved in storage and support, containing fewer chloroplasts.
  - The **epidermis** serves as the protective outer layer of leaves and stems and contains fewer chloroplasts.
  - The **vascular cambium** is involved in the secondary growth of stems and roots, producing vascular tissues but not directly participating in photosynthesis.
- **Oxygen Production**: Since oxygen is a byproduct of photosynthesis, tissues with higher photosynthetic activity will have higher rates of oxygen production.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Cortex**
   - *Incorrect*: The cortex primarily functions in storage and support within stems and roots. It contains fewer chloroplasts and is not a major site of photosynthesis.
2. **Palisade Mesophyll**
   - *Correct*: The palisade mesophyll cells are densely packed with chloroplasts and are the main sites of photosynthesis in the leaf, leading to high oxygen production.
3. **Epidermis**
   - *Incorrect*: The epidermis acts as a protective layer and has minimal chloroplasts, contributing little to photosynthesis and oxygen production.
4. **Vascular Cambium**
   - *Incorrect*: The vascular cambium is responsible for the production of secondary vascular tissues and does not play a direct role in photosynthesis.

**4. Final Selection**
- **My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which plant tissue in an actively photosynthesizing plant produces oxygen at the highest rate. This requires understanding where photosynthesis primarily occurs in plants and the structural adaptations of different tissues.  

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Photosynthesis Location**: Photosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts, specifically in cells containing chlorophyll.  
- **Leaf Anatomy**: In leaves, the **palisade mesophyll** is the primary site of photosynthesis. These cells are tightly packed, columnar, and rich in chloroplasts, maximizing light absorption.  
- **Other Tissues**:  
  - **Cortex**: Found in stems and roots; involved in storage, not photosynthesis.  
  - **Epidermis**: Outer protective layer with few chloroplasts.  
  - **Vascular Cambium**: Responsible for secondary growth (thickening) in stems; lacks chloroplasts.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Cortex)**: Incorrect. The cortex is not specialized for photosynthesis. It is involved in storage or structural support in stems and roots, not oxygen production.  
- **Option 2 (Palisade mesophyll)**: Correct. This tissue is densely packed with chloroplasts and is the primary site of photosynthesis in leaves, directly correlating with high oxygen production.  
- **Option 3 (Epidermis)**: Incorrect. Epidermal cells have minimal chloroplasts and serve protective functions, not photosynthesis.  
- **Option 4 (Vascular cambium)**: Incorrect. The vascular cambium is involved in growth, not photosynthesis. It lacks chloroplasts entirely.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  

The palisade mesophyll is the correct answer because it contains the highest density of chloroplasts and is the primary site of photosynthesis in actively photosynthesizing leaves. This structure maximizes light capture and carbon fixation, leading to the highest oxygen production rate among the listed tissues.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks which plant tissue exhibits the highest oxygen production during active photosynthesis. This requires identifying the tissue with the highest photosynthetic activity, as oxygen is a direct product of the light-dependent reactions in chloroplasts.  

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Photosynthesis location**: Primarily occurs in chloroplast-containing tissues, especially in leaves.  
- **Tissue roles**:  
  - **Palisade mesophyll**: Tightly packed, chloroplast-rich cells in leaves optimized for light absorption.  
  - **Cortex**: Parenchyma cells in stems/roots; lacks chloroplasts in most plants.  
  - **Epidermis**: Outer protective layer; typically lacks chloroplasts (except guard cells, which have few).  
  - **Vascular cambium**: Meristematic tissue producing vascular tissues; no chloroplasts.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Cortex)**: Lacks chloroplasts in photosynthetic contexts; minimal/no oxygen production. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 2 (Palisade mesophyll)**: Contains the highest density of chloroplasts and is directly exposed to light, maximizing photosynthesis. **Correct**.  
- **Option 3 (Epidermis)**: Lacks chloroplasts in most cells; guard cells contribute negligibly. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 4 (Vascular cambium)**: Non-photosynthetic; involved in secondary growth. **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
- The palisade mesophyll is specialized for photosynthesis, with abundant chloroplasts and optimal light exposure, making it the primary site of oxygen production.  

**My final selection is: Option 2**
