**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is asking which of the listed activities fungi do NOT participate in. It requires identifying the exception among the given biological processes or associations related to fungi.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Fungi Metabolism:** Fungi obtain energy through the decomposition of organic matter, not through photosynthesis.
- **Fermentation:** Certain fungi, like yeasts, perform fermentation to produce alcohol.
- **Human Association:** Fungi can infect humans, causing diseases such as ringworm.
- **Mycorrhizae Formation:** Many fungi form symbiotic relationships with plant roots, known as mycorrhizae, enhancing nutrient uptake for plants.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: photosynthesis to produce glucose**  
  - **Incorrect**: Fungi do not perform photosynthesis. They are heterotrophic organisms that rely on absorbing organic compounds for energy.
  
- **Option 2: fermentation to produce alcohol**  
  - **Correct**: Yeasts, a type of fungi, are well-known for their role in alcoholic fermentation.
  
- **Option 3: association with humans to produce ringworm**  
  - **Correct**: Fungi can cause ringworm, a common fungal infection in humans.
  
- **Option 4: association with the roots of plants to form mycorrhizae**  
  - **Correct**: Fungi form mycorrhizal associations with plant roots, benefiting both the plant and the fungus.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which process fungi **do not** participate in. The options involve metabolic processes and symbiotic/parasitic relationships. The key is to identify the activity that is biologically inconsistent with fungi.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Photosynthesis**: Only organisms with chlorophyll (plants, algae, cyanobacteria) can perform photosynthesis. Fungi lack chlorophyll and are heterotrophic.  
- **Fermentation**: Some fungi (e.g., yeast) ferment sugars to produce alcohol and CO₂, as in brewing.  
- **Ringworm**: Caused by dermatophyte fungi that infect skin, hair, and nails.  
- **Mycorrhizae**: Symbiotic associations between fungi and plant roots, enhancing nutrient uptake for the plant.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Photosynthesis requires chlorophyll, which fungi do not possess. Fungi cannot produce glucose via photosynthesis. **This is an exception.**  
- **Option 2**: Yeast (a fungus) ferments sugars to produce alcohol. This is a well-documented process. **Not an exception.**  
- **Option 3**: Fungi like dermatophytes cause ringworm in humans. **Not an exception.**  
- **Option 4**: Mycorrhizal associations are a hallmark symbiotic relationship involving fungi. **Not an exception.**  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**

DeepSeek的选择:
选择: 选项 1 (photosynthesis to produce glucose)

DeepSeek的完整回答:
================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks which biological process or association listed is NOT performed by fungi. It tests understanding of fungal roles in ecosystems and human contexts, including metabolic processes and symbiotic relationships.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Photosynthesis**: Requires chlorophyll and chloroplasts (absent in fungi). Fungi are heterotrophs, relying on external organic matter.  
- **Fermentation**: Fungi (e.g., yeast) metabolize sugars anaerobically to produce ethanol and CO₂.  
- **Ringworm**: A fungal infection (e.g., *Trichophyton* species) causing skin diseases.  
- **Mycorrhizae**: Mutualistic symbiosis between fungi and plant roots, enhancing nutrient exchange.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Fungi lack chloroplasts and cannot perform photosynthesis. This process is exclusive to autotrophs (plants, algae, cyanobacteria). **Incorrect** (EXCEPT answer).  
- **Option 2**: Fungi like *Saccharomyces* conduct alcohol fermentation. **Correct** (fungi participate).  
- **Option 3**: Ringworm is caused by fungi (dermatophytes). **Correct** (fungi participate).  
- **Option 4**: Mycorrhizae are fungal-root associations critical for nutrient uptake. **Correct** (fungi participate).  

**4. Final Selection**  
- The exception is **Option 1**, as fungi do not engage in photosynthesis. Their heterotrophic nature precludes glucose production via this process.  

**My final selection is: Option 1**
