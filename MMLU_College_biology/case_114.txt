**1. Question Analysis**  
The question seeks an explanation of how mutations in DNA can lead to the manifestation of a new phenotype. It focuses on the molecular mechanisms by which changes in the DNA sequence can influence the traits expressed by an organism.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
To answer this question, it's essential to understand the central dogma of molecular biology, which describes the flow of genetic information from DNA to RNA to protein. Mutations in DNA can lead to alterations in the RNA transcript and, subsequently, changes in the amino acid sequence of proteins. These changes can affect the structure and function of proteins, potentially resulting in new or altered phenotypes. Key concepts include:
- **DNA Mutations**: Alterations in the nucleotide sequence of DNA.
- **Transcription and Translation**: Processes by which genetic information is converted into functional proteins.
- **Protein Structure and Function**: Changes in amino acid sequences can modify protein folding and activity, influencing phenotypic traits.

**3. Analysis of Options**

1. **A different polypeptide is produced.**  
   - **Correct.** Mutations in DNA can lead to changes in the mRNA transcript, resulting in the incorporation of different amino acids during translation. This can produce a polypeptide with an altered amino acid sequence, potentially changing the protein's structure and function, and thereby creating a new phenotype.

2. **The polarity of tRNA becomes the opposite of that of DNA.**  
   - **Incorrect.** The polarity of tRNA is determined by its anticodon and is complementary to the mRNA codon. DNA mutations do not invert tRNA polarity; instead, they can alter the codon sequence that tRNA recognizes, potentially leading to different amino acid incorporations.

3. **Nucleic acids are methylated.**  
   - **Incorrect.** While DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that can affect gene expression, it is not a direct result of DNA mutations. Methylation involves adding methyl groups to DNA, typically affecting gene regulation without altering the nucleotide sequence.

4. **The gene is now read in the 3′ to 5′ direction.**  
   - **Incorrect.** DNA is transcribed in the 5′ to 3′ direction, and mutations do not reverse the reading direction of a gene. Such a reversal would disrupt the transcription process and is not a plausible outcome of standard DNA mutations.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks how mutations in DNA can lead to the expression of a new phenotype. It requires understanding the relationship between genetic mutations and observable traits, focusing on molecular mechanisms that connect DNA changes to altered protein function or expression.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **DNA Mutations and Proteins**: Mutations alter the DNA sequence, which can change the mRNA transcribed from it. This may result in a different amino acid sequence in the resulting polypeptide (protein), affecting its structure or function.  
- **Phenotypic Expression**: Proteins are responsible for most cellular functions. A mutated protein may malfunction, leading to a new or altered trait (phenotype).  
- **Mechanisms of Mutation Effects**:  
  - **Missense Mutations**: Change a single amino acid.  
  - **Nonsense Mutations**: Create premature stop codons.  
  - **Frameshift Mutations**: Alter the reading frame, drastically changing the amino acid sequence.  
- **tRNA and Polarity**: tRNA anticodons pair with mRNA codons during translation, but their polarity is fixed and unrelated to mutation-induced phenotypic changes.  
- **Methylation**: While DNA methylation can regulate gene expression, it is typically an epigenetic modification rather than a mutation.  
- **DNA Reading Direction**: DNA is transcribed in the 5′ to 3′ direction on the template strand. The direction of reading is a fixed process and cannot be reversed by mutations.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: A different polypeptide is produced.  
  - **Correct**: Mutations in DNA can alter the mRNA sequence, leading to changes in the polypeptide’s amino acid sequence. This directly impacts protein function and can result in a new phenotype.  
- **Option 2**: The polarity of tRNA becomes the opposite of that of DNA.  
  - **Incorrect**: tRNA polarity is not a relevant concept here. tRNA anticodons pair with mRNA codons (5′ to 3′ on mRNA), and DNA polarity is fixed. This option misrepresents molecular biology principles.  
- **Option 3**: Nucleic acids are methylated.  
  - **Incorrect**: Methylation is an epigenetic modification, not a mutation. While it can affect gene expression, the question specifies mutations in DNA, not regulatory mechanisms.  
- **Option 4**: The gene is now read in the 3′ to 5′ direction.  
  - **Incorrect**: DNA is read in the 5′ to 3′ direction during transcription. The direction of reading is determined by DNA’s structure and cannot be reversed by mutations.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**  

A mutation in DNA can alter the nucleotide sequence, resulting in a different mRNA transcript. This mRNA will direct the synthesis of a polypeptide with a modified amino acid sequence. Since proteins determine cellular functions and traits, a different polypeptide directly explains how mutations lead to new phenotypes. The other options either misrepresent biological processes (Option 2 and 4) or address unrelated mechanisms (Option 3).

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks how DNA mutations lead to new phenotypes. It requires understanding the relationship between DNA changes, protein synthesis, and observable traits.  

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- Phenotypes arise from proteins encoded by genes.  
- DNA mutations alter mRNA codons during transcription, potentially changing the amino acid sequence in the resulting polypeptide.  
- Altered polypeptides may affect protein structure/function, leading to phenotypic changes.  
- Non-coding mutations (e.g., regulatory regions) can also affect phenotypes, but the question focuses on general mechanisms.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Correct. Mutations in DNA can alter mRNA codons, leading to different amino acids in polypeptides. This directly impacts protein function, which may manifest as a new phenotype (e.g., sickle cell anemia).  
- **Option 2**: Incorrect. tRNA polarity (anticodon orientation) is inherent to its structure and independent of DNA mutations. Mutations do not reverse tRNA polarity.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. Methylation is an epigenetic modification (not a DNA sequence mutation) and does not explain how mutations cause new phenotypes.  
- **Option 4**: Incorrect. DNA is always transcribed 5′→3′; mutations cannot reverse this directionality, which is enzymatically determined.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**  
This option directly links DNA mutations to altered polypeptides, which are the molecular basis for phenotypic changes. Other options involve unrelated mechanisms or violate core biological principles.
