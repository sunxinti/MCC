Experiments on song development in birds have shown that when a young male reared in isolation hears only the song of a different bird species, he will develop an adult song repertoire that lacks certain characteristics typical of his own species. This result shows that the song of his species is most likely

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question examines the mechanisms underlying song development in birds, specifically whether the song characteristics are learned, instinctive, or a combination of both. It focuses on how environmental exposure (listening to a different species' song) affects the development of species-specific song traits.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Song Learning in Birds:** Many bird species rely on both genetic (instinctive) and environmental (learned) factors to develop their songs.
- **Critical Periods:** There are specific developmental windows during which young birds learn songs from their environment.
- **Species-Specific Characteristics:** Certain song elements are innate, ensuring species-specific communication, while others are influenced by learning from conspecifics.
- **Isolation Studies:** Experiments showing that isolation or exposure to different species' songs can alter the typical song repertoire indicate a balance between innate and learned components.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Entirely learned during development:**  
   - **Incorrect.** If songs were entirely learned, isolation or exposure to different species' songs would completely determine the song repertoire. However, the presence of species-specific characteristics despite limited exposure suggests innate components.
   
2. **Entirely instinctive:**  
   - **Incorrect.** The fact that exposure to a different species' song alters the song repertoire indicates that learning plays a role, contradicting the notion that songs are entirely instinctive.
   
3. **Both instinctive and learned:**  
   - **Correct.** The experiment demonstrates that while some song characteristics are innate, others are learned from environmental exposure. The absence of certain species-specific traits when reared with a different species' song underscores the interplay of instinct and learning.
   
4. **Dependent upon hormones for proper development:**  
   - **Incorrect.** While hormones may influence song development, the question specifically addresses the learned versus instinctive aspects, making this option less directly relevant.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question examines the mechanisms behind song development in birds, specifically whether the song is learned, innate, a combination, or influenced by hormones. It tests understanding of how environmental input (tutor songs) interacts with innate biological predispositions in shaping behavior.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Birdsong Development**: Many songbirds exhibit a mix of innate and learned components. For example, zebra finches have critical periods during which they must hear conspecific (same species) songs to develop species-typical vocalizations.  
- **Innate vs. Learned Behavior**:  
  - *Instinctive (innate)*: Behaviors present without learning (e.g., innate song templates).  
  - *Learned*: Requires exposure to environmental stimuli (e.g., tutor songs).  
- **Critical Period**: A developmental stage when certain experiences (e.g., hearing songs) are necessary for proper behavior development.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (entirely learned)**: Incorrect. If songs were entirely learned, birds raised in isolation with no exposure to their own species would produce no song. However, the question states the bird still develops a song repertoire (albeit incomplete), implying an innate foundation.  
- **Option 2 (entirely instinctive)**: Incorrect. If songs were purely instinctive, exposure to another species’ song would not affect the bird’s ability to produce its own species’ song. The experiment shows that the bird’s song lacks species-specific traits, which contradicts this option.  
- **Option 3 (both instinctive and learned)**: Correct. The bird requires exposure to its own species’ song to fully develop species-typical characteristics (learned component), but the capacity to produce a song exists without exposure (innate component). This aligns with the concept of a "song template" that guides learning.  
- **Option 4 (dependent on hormones)**: Incorrect. While hormones like testosterone influence song production and courtship behavior, the question focuses on the *structure* of the song, not its timing or motivation. Hormones do not explain why the bird’s song lacks species-specific traits when exposed to another species’ songs.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  

The experiment demonstrates that the bird’s song is shaped by both innate predispositions (allowing it to produce some song without exposure) and learned components (requiring exposure to conspecific songs for full species-typical traits). This dual requirement is characteristic of behaviors that are both instinctive (providing a framework) and learned (filling in specifics).

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question examines the role of innate (instinctive) versus learned components in bird song development. It asks which explanation best accounts for the observation that a male bird raised in isolation and exposed to a different species’ song develops an atypical song lacking species-specific characteristics.  

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Song learning in birds**: Many bird species require exposure to conspecific (same-species) songs during a critical developmental period to produce normal adult songs. However, innate mechanisms also guide song structure.  
- **Innate templates**: Birds may possess an innate predisposition to recognize and reproduce species-specific song patterns, even if learning refines these patterns.  
- **Interaction of genes and environment**: Normal song development often involves both genetic predisposition (innate components) and learning from auditory input.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Entirely learned)**: Incorrect. If song were entirely learned, the bird would mimic the heterospecific (different-species) song entirely. The fact that the song lacks *specific* species-typical traits suggests innate expectations are unmet due to improper auditory input.  
- **Option 2 (Entirely instinctive)**: Incorrect. If song were entirely innate, isolation or exposure to heterospecific songs would not disrupt species-specific song development. The observed deficits imply learning is necessary.  
- **Option 3 (Both instinctive and learned)**: Correct. The incomplete song implies innate templates guide the "expected" structure, but proper development requires learning from conspecific songs. For example, white-crowned sparrows require auditory input to refine innate song precursors.  
- **Option 4 (Hormone-dependent)**: Incorrect. While hormones influence song development (e.g., testosterone in maturation), the question focuses on auditory experience, not endocrine factors.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The experiment demonstrates that normal song development requires both innate predispositions (to produce species-specific features) and learned input (to refine these features). Absent conspecific auditory input, innate templates alone cannot fully replicate the species-typical song.  

**My final selection is: Option 3**
