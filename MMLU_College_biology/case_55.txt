问题: 
In an experiment, the first cleavage plane of an amphibian zygote was manipulated so that the gray crescent was contained in only one of the two blastomeres that result from the first cleavage. The two blastomeres were then separated. What is the expected fate of the blastomeres?
选项: 
1. The blastomere with the gray crescent will grow in size more quickly than the one without the gray crescent.
2. The blastomere with the gray crescent will form a complete, but small, embryo.
3. The blastomere without the gray crescent will form a complete, but small, embryo.
4. The blastomere with the gray crescent will stop dividing and die before the second cleavage.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question examines the developmental biology of amphibian embryos, specifically focusing on the role of the gray crescent during the first cleavage of a zygote. It asks about the developmental outcome when the gray crescent is confined to one of the two resulting blastomeres and these blastomeres are subsequently separated.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Gray Crescent Significance:** In amphibian embryology, the gray crescent is a crucial determinant region formed after the first cleavage. It contains essential factors that establish the dorsal-ventral axis and are vital for proper embryonic development.
- **Blastomere Fate Determination:** Cells containing the gray crescent (dorsal determinants) have the potential to develop into a complete embryo, albeit smaller due to having fewer cells. Conversely, blastomeres without the gray crescent lack these critical determinants and typically cannot develop into a viable embryo.
- **Cellular Totipotency:** While early blastomeres are generally totipotent, the presence of specific determinants like those in the gray crescent directs their developmental fate.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Incorrect.** While the blastomere with the gray crescent has developmental determinants, there is no inherent reason it would grow more quickly solely based on containing the gray crescent.
2. **Correct.** The blastomere with the gray crescent contains the necessary dorsal determinants to develop into a complete embryo, though it may be smaller due to having half the original cellular material.
3. **Incorrect.** The blastomere without the gray crescent lacks the dorsal determinants and thus cannot form a complete embryo.
4. **Incorrect.** The blastomere with the gray crescent has the potential to develop appropriately and does not inherently stop dividing or die.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question examines the role of the gray crescent in amphibian embryonic development, specifically its influence on cell fate after the first cleavage. The experiment tests the consequences of isolating the gray crescent into one blastomere, requiring an understanding of embryonic axis specification and cell differentiation.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Gray Crescent Function**: In amphibians, the gray crescent is a determinant region crucial for establishing the dorsoventral axis. It contains maternal mRNAs and signaling molecules that initiate the formation of Spemann’s organizer, which directs gastrulation and patterning.  
- **First Cleavage Dynamics**: The first cleavage typically divides the zygote into two blastomeres. Normally, each contributes to different regions of the embryo, but experimental manipulation can disrupt this.  
- **Blastomere Separation Outcomes**: If separated early, amphibian blastomeres can sometimes form smaller but complete embryos (e.g., in newts), but this depends on the presence of essential determinants like the gray crescent.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Incorrect. The gray crescent’s role is in patterning, not growth rate. Growth would depend on cytoplasmic resources (e.g., yolk), not the crescent itself.  
- **Option 2**: Correct. The blastomere with the gray crescent retains the organizer’s signaling molecules, enabling it to form a complete embryo. However, its smaller size (due to being only half the original zygote) would result in a smaller embryo.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. The blastomere without the gray crescent lacks the organizer, preventing proper dorsoventral axis formation. It cannot develop into a complete embryo.  
- **Option 4**: Incorrect. The gray crescent does not induce cell death; instead, it drives patterning. The blastomere with the crescent would continue dividing but develop abnormally if isolated.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  
The blastomere containing the gray crescent retains the organizer’s signaling molecules, allowing it to direct embryonic development. Its smaller size results from being half the original zygote, but it can still form a complete (though smaller) embryo. The blastomere without the crescent lacks the organizer and cannot form a functional embryo.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question examines the role of the gray crescent in amphibian embryonic development, specifically how its distribution between blastomeres affects their developmental potential after separation. Understanding the gray crescent's function in axis formation and embryo organization is critical.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Gray Crescent**: A region formed after fertilization in amphibians due to cortical rotation. It contains determinants for dorsal-ventral axis formation and is the site of the Spemann organizer, which orchestrates embryonic patterning.  
- **Regulative Development**: Amphibian embryos exhibit regulative development, where cells adjust their fate based on positional signals. However, the gray crescent is essential for initiating this organization.  
- **Experimental Context**: If the gray crescent is restricted to one blastomere, that blastomere retains the ability to form a complete embryo via the Spemann organizer. The blastomere lacking the gray crescent cannot establish proper axes and typically forms an unorganized mass (e.g., a "belly piece").

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Incorrect. Growth rate differences are irrelevant; the key distinction is organizational capacity, not size.  
- **Option 2**: Correct. The blastomere with the gray crescent contains the Spemann organizer, enabling it to regulate development and form a smaller but complete embryo. This aligns with classical experiments (e.g., Spemann and Mangold).  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. The blastomere without the gray crescent lacks the organizer and cannot establish proper axes, leading to incomplete development.  
- **Option 4**: Incorrect. The gray crescent promotes survival and development; its presence does not halt division.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  
The blastomere with the gray crescent retains the Spemann organizer, enabling it to regulate development and form a complete embryo, albeit smaller. The other blastomere lacks this critical signaling center and fails to organize properly. This conclusion is consistent with the principle of regulative development and experimental evidence in amphibian embryology.
