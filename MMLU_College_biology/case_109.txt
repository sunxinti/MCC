**1. Question Analysis**  
The question examines the relationship between unusually small litter sizes in a species of small rodent and another characteristic that these rodents are likely to exhibit. It focuses on understanding the biological implications of having fewer offspring than typical for small rodents.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Reproductive Strategies:** In biology, reproductive strategies often balance the number of offspring with the investment in each. r-selected species typically produce many offspring with minimal parental care, whereas K-selected species produce fewer offspring with significant parental investment.
- **Parental Investment:** High parental investment involves dedicating more time, energy, and resources to each offspring, enhancing their survival rates.
- **Life History Traits:** Traits such as litter size, parental care, and developmental stages of the young are interconnected and influence each other.

**3. Analysis of Options**  

1. **Moderate sexual size dimorphism**  
   - *Evaluation:* Sexual size dimorphism pertains to size differences between males and females. While it relates to reproductive strategies, it doesn't directly correlate with litter size.
   - *Conclusion:* Incorrect.

2. **High parental investment**  
   - *Evaluation:* Smaller litter sizes are often associated with higher parental investment per offspring. This ensures that each offspring has a better chance of survival, which is consistent with the observation that having only two or three pups is unusual for small rodents.
   - *Conclusion:* Correct.

3. **Precocial young**  
   - *Evaluation:* Precocial young are relatively mature and mobile from the moment of birth. While this trait can be associated with higher parental investment, it is not as directly linked to litter size as Option 2.
   - *Conclusion:* Incorrect.

4. **Frequent extrapair matings**  
   - *Evaluation:* Extrapair matings involve mating outside the primary pair bond and are related to genetic diversity and reproductive strategies, not directly to the number of offspring produced per litter.
   - *Conclusion:* Incorrect.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question explores the relationship between reproductive strategies and life history traits in small rodents. The key observation is the unusually small litter size (2–3 offspring), which contrasts with the typical larger litters seen in many small rodent species. The task is to identify another characteristic that aligns with this reproductive pattern based on evolutionary and ecological principles.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Life History Trade-offs**: Species with small litter sizes often prioritize quality over quantity, investing more resources per offspring (K-selected strategy). This contrasts with r-selected species, which produce many offspring with minimal parental care.  
- **Parental Investment**: High parental investment typically correlates with smaller litter sizes because parents can better ensure the survival of fewer, more cared-for offspring.  
- **Precocial vs. Altricial Young**: Precocial young (e.g., ducks) are independent soon after birth, reducing parental care needs. Altricial young (e.g., mice) require prolonged parental care, aligning with small litter sizes and high investment.  
- **Mating Systems**: Species with monogamous pair bonds and high parental care often exhibit lower sexual dimorphism and reduced extrapair mating compared to promiscuous species.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Moderate sexual size dimorphism)**: Sexual dimorphism is unrelated to litter size. It depends more on mating competition (e.g., polygyny) or resource availability. No strong link to small litters. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 2 (High parental investment)**: Small litter sizes strongly correlate with increased parental investment (e.g., extended care, protection). This aligns with K-selected strategies and is the most biologically plausible. **Correct**.  
- **Option 3 (Precocial young)**: Precocial young reduce the need for parental care, which would conflict with the expectation of high investment in small litters. Altricial young (common in small rodents with high parental care) are more likely. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 4 (Frequent extrapair matings)**: Frequent extrapair matings are associated with polygamous or promiscuous mating systems, which typically involve lower parental investment. This contradicts the small litter size and likely monogamy in this species. **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  

High parental investment is the most accurate answer because small litter sizes in rodents are strongly associated with increased parental care and investment per offspring. This aligns with K-selected life history strategies, where survival and reproductive success depend on ensuring the survival of fewer, better-provisioned offspring rather than producing many with minimal care.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question examines the relationship between a rodent's small litter size and other life history traits. It requires understanding how reproductive strategies (e.g., parental investment, mating systems) correlate with offspring number in ecological and evolutionary contexts.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Life History Theory**: Species with small litter sizes often exhibit traits associated with **K-selection** (e.g., high parental investment, delayed maturation, longer lifespans), contrasting with **r-selected** species (e.g., large litters, minimal parental care).  
- **Parental Investment**: Reduced litter size typically allows parents to allocate more resources and care per offspring, increasing survival rates.  
- **Precocial vs. Altricial Young**: Precocial young are relatively independent at birth (reducing parental care demands), while altricial young require extensive care.  
- **Sexual Dimorphism and Mating Systems**: High dimorphism often correlates with intense male-male competition, while monogamy and biparental care may reduce dimorphism.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Moderate sexual size dimorphism)**: Unlikely. Small litter sizes and high parental investment often align with monogamous systems, where sexual dimorphism is reduced (both parents invest in care). Moderate dimorphism is less directly tied to litter size.  
- **Option 2 (High parental investment)**: Strong candidate. Small litters allow parents to focus energy on fewer offspring, a hallmark of K-selection. This aligns with increased care (e.g., feeding, protection) to enhance offspring survival.  
- **Option 3 (Precocial young)**: Unlikely. Precocial young require less parental investment, which contradicts the need for high care implied by small litters. Altricial young (not listed) would better match high investment.  
- **Option 4 (Frequent extrapair matings)**: Unlikely. Extrapair matings are common in promiscuous systems where males maximize offspring number. Small litters and high parental care typically favor monogamy, reducing extrapair mating frequency.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The rodent’s small litter size strongly suggests a K-selected strategy, prioritizing quality over quantity. High parental investment (Option 2) directly aligns with this strategy, as parents allocate more resources to ensure the survival of their limited offspring. Other options lack a clear biological link to reduced litter size.  

**My final selection is: Option 2**
