================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is inquiring about the pattern of alternation of generations in ferns. Specifically, it seeks to identify the relationship between the sporophyte and gametophyte phases in the fern life cycle.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Alternation of Generations**: This is a reproductive cycle found in plants where there is a switch between diploid sporophyte and haploid gametophyte multicellular stages.
- **Ferns**: In ferns, the sporophyte is the dominant, large, and long-lived phase, while the gametophyte is small, independent, and short-lived.
- **Sporophyte**: Produces spores through meiosis.
- **Gametophyte**: Produces gametes through mitosis.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Dominant sporophyte alternates with an independent gametophyte**  
   - **Correct**. In ferns, the sporophyte is the dominant phase, and the gametophyte is independent, albeit small and short-lived.
2. **Dominant gametophyte alternates with a dependent sporophyte**  
   - **Incorrect**. This description is characteristic of some algae, not ferns. In ferns, the sporophyte is dominant.
3. **Sporophyte and a gametophyte have equal life spans**  
   - **Incorrect**. In ferns, the sporophyte is significantly longer-lived than the gametophyte.
4. **Gametophyte produces gametes by meiosis**  
   - **Incorrect**. Gametophytes produce gametes by mitosis. Meiosis occurs in the sporophyte to produce spores.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks about the alternation of generations in ferns, focusing on the relationship between the sporophyte and gametophyte stages. It requires knowledge of plant life cycles, specifically distinguishing between the dominant and non-dominant stages in ferns.  

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Alternation of Generations**: A life cycle where a diploid sporophyte (spore-producing) alternates with a haploid gametophyte (gamete-producing).  
- **Fern Life Cycle**: Ferns are vascular plants in which the **sporophyte** (the large, leafy plant we typically recognize) is dominant and long-lived. The **gametophyte** (a small, heart-shaped structure) is photosynthetic and independent but short-lived.  
- **Gamete Production**: Gametes are produced via **mitosis** in the gametophyte, while spores are produced via **meiosis** in the sporophyte.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: "Dominant sporophyte alternates with an independent gametophyte."  
  - **Correct**: Ferns have a dominant sporophyte (visible plant), and their gametophyte is independent (not dependent on the sporophyte) but not dominant.  
- **Option 2**: "Dominant gametophyte alternates with a dependent sporophyte."  
  - **Incorrect**: This describes non-vascular plants like mosses, where the gametophyte is dominant. Ferns have the opposite arrangement.  
- **Option 3**: "Sporophyte and gametophyte have equal life spans."  
  - **Incorrect**: In ferns, the sporophyte is far more dominant and longer-lived than the gametophyte.  
- **Option 4**: "Gametophyte produces gametes by meiosis."  
  - **Incorrect**: Gametes are produced via **mitosis** in the gametophyte. Meiosis occurs in the sporophyte to produce spores.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**  
Ferns exhibit a life cycle where the **sporophyte** (the large, leafy plant) is the dominant, long-lived stage. The gametophyte is independent (it does not rely on the sporophyte) but is small and short-lived. This matches the description in Option 1. The other options either reverse dominance (Option 2), misrepresent life spans (Option 3), or incorrectly attribute meiosis to gamete production (Option 4).

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks about the alternation of generations in ferns, specifically the relationship between the sporophyte and gametophyte stages in terms of dominance and independence.  

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Alternation of generations**: Ferns exhibit a life cycle alternating between a diploid sporophyte (spore-producing phase) and a haploid gametophyte (gamete-producing phase).  
- **Dominance**: In ferns, the sporophyte is the dominant, long-lived, and photosynthetic stage, while the gametophyte (prothallus) is small, short-lived, and independent.  
- **Independence**: Both stages are multicellular and free-living in ferns. The gametophyte is not nutritionally dependent on the sporophyte.  
- **Gamete production**: Gametes (sperm and eggs) are produced via mitosis in the gametophyte, as it is already haploid. Meiosis occurs in the sporophyte to produce haploid spores.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: "Dominant sporophyte alternates with an independent gametophyte"  
  - Correct. Fern sporophytes are dominant, and gametophytes (prothalli) are independent, though smaller and less conspicuous.  
- **Option 2**: "Dominant gametophyte alternates with a dependent sporophyte"  
  - Incorrect. This describes bryophytes (e.g., mosses), where the gametophyte is dominant. Fern sporophytes are dominant and independent.  
- **Option 3**: "Sporophyte and gametophyte have equal life spans"  
  - Incorrect. The fern sporophyte is long-lived, while the gametophyte is ephemeral.  
- **Option 4**: "Gametophyte produces gametes by meiosis"  
  - Incorrect. Gametes are produced via mitosis in the gametophyte. Meiosis occurs in the sporophyte to generate spores.  

**4. Final Selection**  
- The correct answer is **Option 1**, as it accurately reflects the fern life cycle: a dominant sporophyte alternates with an independent gametophyte.  

**My final selection is: Option 1**
