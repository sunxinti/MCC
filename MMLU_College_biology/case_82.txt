**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is inquiring about the hormonal regulation responsible for maintaining adequate serum calcium levels in humans. It requires identifying which hormone plays a key role in calcium homeostasis.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Calcium Homeostasis:** Maintaining stable serum calcium levels is crucial for various physiological processes, including muscle contraction, nerve transmission, and blood clotting.
- **Hormonal Regulation:** Several hormones regulate calcium levels:
  - **Parathyroid hormone (PTH):** Increases serum calcium by stimulating bone resorption, enhancing intestinal absorption (via vitamin D activation), and increasing renal reabsorption of calcium.
  - **Calcitonin:** Decreases serum calcium by inhibiting bone resorption and increasing calcium excretion (not listed among the options).
  - **Vitamin D:** Facilitates intestinal absorption of calcium (not directly listed among the options).
- **Other Hormones Mentioned:**
  - **Thyroxine:** Primarily regulates metabolism.
  - **Glucagon:** Involved in blood glucose regulation.
  - **Growth hormone:** Influences growth and metabolism.

**3. Analysis of Options**  

1. **Thyroxine**
   - **Function:** Regulates metabolic rate, growth, and development.
   - **Relevance to Calcium:** Indirectly affects bone growth but does not directly regulate serum calcium levels.
   - **Conclusion:** Incorrect.

2. **Glucagon**
   - **Function:** Raises blood glucose levels by promoting glycogen breakdown in the liver.
   - **Relevance to Calcium:** No direct role in calcium homeostasis.
   - **Conclusion:** Incorrect.

3. **Growth Hormone**
   - **Function:** Stimulates growth, cell reproduction, and regeneration.
   - **Relevance to Calcium:** Indirect effects on bone growth but does not directly regulate serum calcium levels.
   - **Conclusion:** Incorrect.

4. **Parathyroid Hormone**
   - **Function:** Increases serum calcium levels by stimulating bone resorption, enhancing intestinal calcium absorption (via vitamin D), and increasing renal calcium reabsorption.
   - **Relevance to Calcium:** Directly responsible for maintaining adequate serum calcium levels.
   - **Conclusion:** Correct.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which hormone maintains adequate calcium levels in human serum. This relates to calcium homeostasis, a key process regulated by hormones in the endocrine system. The correct answer must be a hormone directly involved in increasing or decreasing serum calcium to maintain normal levels.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
Calcium homeostasis is primarily regulated by three factors:  
- **Parathyroid hormone (PTH):** Secreted by the parathyroid glands when calcium levels are low. It increases serum calcium by stimulating osteoclast activity (bone resorption), enhancing renal reabsorption of calcium, and promoting vitamin D activation to boost intestinal calcium absorption.  
- **Calcitonin:** Secreted by the thyroid when calcium levels are high. It decreases serum calcium by inhibiting osteoclast activity and promoting calcium deposition in bones.  
- **Vitamin D:** Enhances intestinal calcium absorption.  

Other hormones like **thyroxine**, **glucagon**, and **growth hormone** are not directly involved in calcium regulation.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Thyroxine):** Produced by the thyroid gland, thyroxine regulates metabolism and does not directly affect calcium levels. While the thyroid gland also secretes calcitonin (which lowers calcium), thyroxine itself is unrelated to calcium homeostasis. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 2 (Glucagon):** Released by pancreatic α-cells during low blood glucose. Glucagon stimulates glycogen breakdown and gluconeogenesis but has no role in calcium regulation. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 3 (Growth Hormone):** Secreted by the anterior pituitary, growth hormone regulates growth and metabolism but does not directly influence calcium levels. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 4 (Parathyroid Hormone):** Directly involved in raising serum calcium when levels drop. PTH acts on bones, kidneys, and the intestines to increase calcium availability. This is the primary hormone maintaining calcium homeostasis. **Correct**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question focuses on identifying the hormone responsible for maintaining adequate serum calcium levels in humans. This involves understanding endocrine regulation of calcium homeostasis.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- Calcium homeostasis is primarily regulated by the **parathyroid hormone (PTH)**, calcitonin, and vitamin D.  
- **PTH** is secreted by the parathyroid glands in response to low blood calcium. It increases serum calcium by:  
  - Stimulating osteoclasts to release calcium from bones.  
  - Enhancing renal calcium reabsorption.  
  - Activating vitamin D to promote intestinal calcium absorption.  
- Calcitonin (from the thyroid) lowers calcium levels, but it is not listed as an option.  
- Other hormones listed (thyroxine, glucagon, growth hormone) are unrelated to calcium regulation.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Thyroxine**: Regulates metabolism, not calcium levels. Incorrect.  
2. **Glucagon**: Controls blood glucose via glycogen breakdown. No role in calcium homeostasis. Incorrect.  
3. **Growth hormone**: Promotes tissue growth but does not directly regulate serum calcium. Incorrect.  
4. **Parathyroid hormone (PTH)**: Directly increases blood calcium levels through bone, kidney, and intestinal actions. Correct.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The hormone responsible for maintaining adequate serum calcium levels is **parathyroid hormone (PTH)**, as it directly counteracts hypocalcemia by mobilizing calcium stores and enhancing retention.  

**My final selection is: Option 4**
