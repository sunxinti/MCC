**1. Question Analysis**  
The question is asking which of the listed agents induces polyploidy in a dividing eukaryotic cell. Polyploidy refers to the condition where a cell or organism has more than two complete sets of chromosomes. Inducing polyploidy typically involves disrupting normal cell division processes to prevent the separation of chromosomes, leading to cells with increased chromosome numbers.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Polyploidy Mechanism:** Polyploidy can be induced by agents that interfere with the mitotic spindle formation or function, preventing proper chromosome segregation during cell division.
- **Mitotic Inhibitors:** Chemicals like colchicine disrupt microtubule polymerization, which is essential for spindle formation and chromosome movement, leading to polyploid cells.
- **Antibiotics and Protein Synthesis:** Some antibiotics target bacterial processes and are not directly involved in altering eukaryotic cell chromosome numbers.

**3. Analysis of Options**

1. **Penicillin**
   - **Function:** Penicillin is an antibiotic that inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by targeting transpeptidase enzymes.
   - **Relevance to Polyploidy:** It primarily affects bacteria and does not interfere with eukaryotic cell division or chromosome segregation.
   - **Conclusion:** Incorrect.

2. **Colchicine**
   - **Function:** Colchicine binds to tubulin, inhibiting microtubule polymerization, which disrupts the formation of the mitotic spindle.
   - **Relevance to Polyploidy:** By preventing spindle formation, colchicine halts chromosome segregation during mitosis, leading to cells with doubled chromosome numbers (polyploidy).
   - **Conclusion:** Correct.

3. **Tetracycline**
   - **Function:** Tetracycline is an antibiotic that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit.
   - **Relevance to Polyploidy:** It primarily affects bacteria and does not interfere with eukaryotic cell division or chromosome segregation.
   - **Conclusion:** Incorrect.

4. **Puromycin**
   - **Function:** Puromycin is an antibiotic that inhibits protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells by causing premature chain termination during translation.
   - **Relevance to Polyploidy:** While it affects eukaryotic protein synthesis, it does not specifically interfere with mitotic spindle formation or chromosome segregation necessary to induce polyploidy.
   - **Conclusion:** Incorrect.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which agent induces polyploidy in a dividing eukaryote. Polyploidy refers to the presence of more than two complete sets of chromosomes in a cell. This typically occurs when cell division (mitosis or meiosis) is disrupted, preventing proper chromosome segregation. The key is identifying an agent that specifically interferes with cellular processes critical for normal division.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Polyploidy Induction**: Polyploidy is often induced by agents that disrupt mitotic spindle formation or inhibit cytokinesis.  
- **Microtubule Inhibitors**: Agents like colchicine bind to tubulin, preventing microtubule polymerization and thereby blocking spindle formation. This halts cell division, causing chromosomes to remain in the parent cell, leading to polyploidy.  
- **Other Agents**: Antibiotics like penicillin (cell wall synthesis inhibitor), tetracycline (protein synthesis inhibitor in bacteria), and puromycin (protein synthesis disruptor) act on different cellular targets and are unrelated to spindle formation or chromosome segregation.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Penicillin**  
  - **Mechanism**: Inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis.  
  - **Relevance**: Irrelevant to eukaryotic cell division, as eukaryotes (except plants/fungi) lack cell walls. Does not affect spindle formation or chromosome segregation.  
  - **Conclusion**: Incorrect.  

- **Option 2: Colchicine**  
  - **Mechanism**: Binds to tubulin, preventing microtubule polymerization.  
  - **Relevance**: Disrupts mitotic spindle formation, halting cell division during anaphase. Chromosomes cannot separate, leading to polyploid cells.  
  - **Conclusion**: Correct.  

- **Option 3: Tetracycline**  
  - **Mechanism**: Binds to bacterial ribosomes, inhibiting protein synthesis.  
  - **Relevance**: Primarily affects prokaryotes; eukaryotic cells are less sensitive. Does not directly interfere with spindle formation or chromosome segregation.  
  - **Conclusion**: Incorrect.  

- **Option 4: Puromycin**  
  - **Mechanism**: Mimics aminoacyl-tRNA, causing premature chain termination during protein synthesis.  
  - **Relevance**: Inhibits protein synthesis broadly but does not directly disrupt spindle formation or chromosome segregation. May cause cell death but not polyploidy.  
  - **Conclusion**: Incorrect.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  

Colchicine is the correct answer because it specifically inhibits microtubule assembly, preventing the formation of the mitotic spindle. This blocks chromosome segregation, causing cells to retain both sets of chromosomes and become polyploid. The other options act on unrelated cellular processes and do not directly induce polyploidy in eukaryotes.

DeepSeek的完整回答:
================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks which agent induces polyploidy (a condition where cells have multiple complete sets of chromosomes) in dividing eukaryotes. This requires understanding agents that disrupt normal cell division processes, particularly mitosis/cytokinesis.  

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- Polyploidy arises when chromosome segregation or cytokinesis fails during cell division.  
- Microtubules (composed of tubulin) form the mitotic spindle, which is essential for separating chromosomes. Agents that disrupt microtubule dynamics (e.g., prevent spindle formation) will block chromosome segregation, leading to polyploid cells.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Penicillin**  
  Penicillin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by targeting peptidoglycan cross-linking. It has no effect on eukaryotic microtubules or cell division. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 2: Colchicine**  
  Colchicine binds to tubulin, preventing microtubule polymerization. This disrupts spindle formation, halting chromosome segregation. Cells with replicated chromosomes fail to divide, resulting in polyploidy. **Correct**.  
- **Option 3: Tetracycline**  
  Tetracycline inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit. It does not interfere with eukaryotic microtubules or mitosis. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 4: Puromycin**  
  Puromycin inhibits protein synthesis in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes by prematurely terminating translation. It does not affect microtubules or spindle assembly. **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
Colchicine (Option 2) directly targets microtubules, blocking spindle formation and inducing polyploidy. The other agents lack mechanisms to interfere with mitosis.  

**My final selection is: Option 2**
