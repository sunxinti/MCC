Brood parasites such as the cuckoo successfully trick other species of birds into rearing their young by exploiting the host birds' instinctive response to the loud begging cues of a fledgling in their nest. The genes that allow the host bird species to be duped into rearing the cuckoo fledglings to the detriment of their own offspring most likely remain in the gene pool of the population because
选项: 
1. on average, the host birds' response allows them to rear their own young efficiently by feeding only those who indicate they are hungry
2. the maximum fitness of the duped bird is not compromised when the bird rears an interloper of another species
3. on average, little energy is spent on rearing a fledgling bird, whether it is an interloper or one's own

**1. Question Analysis**
- The question examines the evolutionary persistence of certain genes in host bird species that result in them being deceived by brood parasites like the cuckoo. Specifically, it seeks to understand why the genetic traits that make host birds susceptible to parasitism remain prevalent despite the negative impact on their own offspring's rearing.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**
- **Brood Parasitism**: This is a strategy where one species (the parasite) relies on another species (the host) to raise its young, often at the host's expense.
- **Genetic Persistence**: Traits that persist in a population are typically those that confer some advantage or do not significantly detract from an organism's overall fitness.
- **Host-Parasite Coevolution**: Hosts and parasites often engage in evolutionary arms races, where hosts develop defenses against parasites, and parasites evolve strategies to overcome those defenses.
- **Fitness Consequences**: Traits that significantly reduce an organism's reproductive success are likely to be selected against and diminish over time.

**3. Analysis of Options**

1. **Option 1**: *On average, the host birds' response allows them to rear their own young efficiently by feeding only those who indicate they are hungry.*
   - **Evaluation**: This suggests that the host birds' feeding behavior is efficient for their own offspring, potentially offsetting the cost of parasitism. If host birds are efficient in rearing their own young, the detrimental effect of brood parasitism might not be severe enough to eliminate the deceptive genes. This aligns with evolutionary principles where traits persist if the overall fitness is not significantly compromised.
   - **Conclusion**: This option is consistent with biological understanding.

2. **Option 2**: *The maximum fitness of the duped bird is not compromised when the bird rears an interloper of another species.*
   - **Evaluation**: Rearing a parasitic chick often results in reduced fitness for the host, as resources are diverted away from the host's own offspring. Therefore, this option is generally incorrect because parasitism typically does compromise the host's fitness.
   - **Conclusion**: This option is inconsistent with biological principles.

3. **Option 3**: *On average, little energy is spent on rearing a fledgling bird, whether it is an interloper or one's own.*
   - **Evaluation**: Brood parasitism typically increases the energy expenditure for host birds, as they have to feed an additional chick. This contradicts the premise of the option.
   - **Conclusion**: This option is incorrect based on biological knowledge.

4. **Option 4**: *The maximum fitness of the cuckoo would then be reduced.*
   - **Evaluation**: If host fitness is not compromised, it indirectly allows cuckoo fitness to remain unaffected or even potentially increased. However, the option suggests that cuckoo fitness would be reduced, which does not directly explain why deceptive genes persist in the host.
   - **Conclusion**: This option does not directly address the persistence of deceptive genes in the host population and is therefore less relevant.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 1**

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question explores evolutionary biology, specifically the persistence of genes in host bird populations that make them susceptible to brood parasitism by cuckoos. It asks why these genes remain in the gene pool despite the fitness cost of raising cuckoo fledglings instead of their own offspring.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Co-evolution and Arms Race**: Host birds and brood parasites like cuckoos are in an evolutionary arms race. Hosts evolve defenses (e.g., egg recognition), while cuckoos evolve countermeasures (e.g., egg mimicry).  
- **Fitness Trade-offs**: A behavior that benefits hosts under normal conditions might occasionally be exploited by parasites. If the overall fitness benefit of the behavior outweighs the cost of parasitism, the genes for that behavior persist.  
- **Optimal Foraging and Parental Investment**: Host birds likely evolved to prioritize feeding offspring that signal hunger (via begging) to efficiently allocate limited resources. This behavior is generally adaptive but can be exploited by cuckoos.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: States that the host’s response allows efficient rearing of their own young by feeding only those who beg. This aligns with the idea that prioritizing begging signals is beneficial *on average*, even if occasionally exploited. The behavior’s net benefit (ensuring their own offspring are fed when hungry) likely outweighs the rare cost of parasitism. **Correct**.  
- **Option 2**: Claims the host’s maximum fitness is uncompromised. However, parasitism reduces the host’s reproductive success (e.g., fewer own offspring survive). This is incorrect because the cost to fitness is real, even if not catastrophic. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 3**: Suggests rearing fledglings is low energy. This contradicts biological reality: raising offspring, especially cuckoos (which often outcompete host chicks for food), is energetically costly. Hosts often suffer fitness losses. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 4**: Focuses on the cuckoo’s fitness. The question asks why the host’s genes persist, not why cuckoos thrive. This option is irrelevant to the host’s evolutionary dynamics. **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**  

The host birds’ instinct to feed offspring based on begging cues is evolutionarily maintained because this strategy, on average, ensures their own young are fed efficiently when hungry. While cuckoos exploit this behavior, the overall fitness benefit of the strategy (under normal conditions) outweighs the occasional cost of parasitism. This trade-off explains why the genes for this behavior persist in the population.

DeepSeek的完整回答:
================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks why genes enabling host birds to be tricked by brood parasites (e.g., cuckoos) persist in the host population, despite the harm to their own offspring. This relates to evolutionary mechanisms, specifically why maladaptive traits might be maintained through natural selection.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Natural Selection and Fitness Trade-offs**: Traits are retained if their benefits (on average) outweigh costs. Even if a trait is occasionally detrimental, it may persist if it provides a net fitness advantage in most scenarios.  
- **Brood Parasitism Dynamics**: Hosts often evolve defenses (e.g., egg rejection), but counteradaptations by parasites (e.g., egg mimicry) can maintain an evolutionary arms race. However, if the cost of rejecting legitimate offspring (due to errors) is higher than occasionally raising a parasite, hosts may retain the trait.  
- **Begging Behavior**: Loud begging in chicks is typically an honest signal of hunger, selected to optimize parental investment. Hosts may retain responsiveness to begging cues if it generally ensures efficient feeding of their own offspring.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Correct. If hosts evolved to feed chicks based on begging cues, this trait ensures efficient allocation of resources to their own hungry offspring in most cases. The occasional cost of raising a cuckoo is outweighed by the overall benefit of maximizing their own offspring’s survival when parasites are absent.  
- **Option 2**: Incorrect. Rearing a cuckoo directly reduces the host’s fitness, as their own offspring often die. Maximum fitness is compromised in parasitized nests.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. Raising fledglings is energetically costly. Hosts invest significant resources, and rearing a cuckoo (which often outcompetes host chicks) exacerbates this cost.  
- **Option 4**: Incorrect. This focuses on the cuckoo’s fitness, not the host’s genes. The question concerns the host’s evolutionary rationale, not the parasite’s fitness reduction.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**  
This option correctly identifies that the host’s begging-response trait is retained because it optimizes feeding efficiency for their own offspring in most scenarios. The occasional parasitism cost is outweighed by the average benefit of the trait, aligning with evolutionary principles of net fitness advantage.
