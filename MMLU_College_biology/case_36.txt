================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is asking for the correct statement about a **sarcomere**, which is the **basic functional unit of striated muscle** (e.g., skeletal muscle). Understanding the structure and function of sarcomeres, including the behavior of their components during muscle contraction and relaxation, is essential.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Sarcomere Structure**: Comprised of **thick filaments (myosin)** and **thin filaments (actin)**. The **H zone** is the region where only thick filaments are present.
- **Muscle Contraction Mechanics**: During contraction, thick and thin filaments slide past each other, leading to the **shortening of the sarcomere** and changes in zones like the H zone.
- **Regulatory Proteins**: **Tropomyosin** and **troponin** are associated with actin in the thin filaments. Tropomyosin blocks the myosin-binding sites on actin in the **relaxed state**, and troponin regulates this blockage in response to calcium ions.
- **Myosin Structure**: Composed of a **head** (with actin-binding and ATPase activity) and a **tail** (involved in filament formation).

**3. Analysis of Options**  

- **Option 1**: *During contraction H zones become elongated.*
  - **Incorrect**. During contraction, the H zone **narrows** because the thick and thin filaments overlap more. Elongation of the H zone would imply less overlap, which occurs during muscle relaxation.

- **Option 2**: *In the relaxed position tropomyosin impedes myosin's access to the binding site of actin.*
  - **Correct**. In a **relaxed muscle**, tropomyosin **covers the myosin-binding sites** on actin, preventing myosin from binding and thus inhibiting contraction until calcium ions are present.

- **Option 3**: *Each myosin helical tail contains an actin-binding site and an ATP-hydrolyzing site.*
  - **Incorrect**. The **myosin head** contains the actin-binding site and ATPase activity, not the helical tail. The tail primarily serves to anchor myosin molecules within the thick filament.

- **Option 4**: *The proteins troponin and tropomyosin constitute the thick and thin filaments, respectively.*
  - **Incorrect**. **Troponin and tropomyosin** are part of the **thin filaments** (actin). The **thick filaments** are primarily composed of **myosin**.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question focuses on understanding the structure and function of a sarcomere in striated muscle, specifically addressing the processes of contraction and relaxation. Key concepts include the roles of actin, myosin, tropomyosin, troponin, and the structural changes in sarcomere components during these processes.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Sarcomere Structure**: Sarcomeres are the functional units of striated muscle, containing thick filaments (myosin) and thin filaments (actin, tropomyosin, and troponin). The H zone is the central region occupied only by the thick filaments.  
- **Muscle Contraction**: The sliding filament model explains contraction, where actin filaments slide over myosin filaments, shortening the sarcomere. The H zone narrows or disappears during contraction.  
- **Regulatory Proteins**: Tropomyosin blocks myosin-binding sites on actin in the relaxed state. Calcium binding to troponin shifts tropomyosin, exposing the binding sites.  
- **Myosin Structure**: Myosin heads (not tails) contain ATPase activity and actin-binding sites. The tails form the helical structure of thick filaments.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Incorrect. During contraction, the sarcomere shortens, causing the H zone (between thin filaments) to *shorten*, not elongate.  
- **Option 2**: Correct. In the relaxed state, tropomyosin physically blocks myosin’s access to actin’s binding sites. Calcium must bind troponin to shift tropomyosin and allow cross-bridge formation.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. The actin-binding and ATP-hydrolyzing sites are on the *head* of myosin, not the helical tail. The tail forms the structural core of thick filaments.  
- **Option 4**: Incorrect. Thick filaments are composed of myosin, while thin filaments contain actin, tropomyosin, and troponin. Troponin and tropomyosin do not constitute the filaments themselves but are regulatory proteins on the thin filaments.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  

**Explanation**:  
Option 2 accurately describes the role of tropomyosin in the relaxed state. During relaxation, tropomyosin sterically blocks myosin’s access to actin’s binding sites, preventing contraction. This aligns with the sliding filament model and the regulatory mechanism involving calcium, troponin, and tropomyosin. The other options are incorrect due to inaccuracies about structural changes during contraction (Option 1), myosin’s functional domains (Option 3), and the composition of filaments (Option 4).

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question assesses understanding of sarcomere structure and function in striated muscles. Key concepts include the sliding filament model, roles of regulatory proteins (troponin, tropomyosin), and structural changes during contraction/relaxation.  

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Sarcomere Structure**: Z-lines define sarcomere boundaries. A-band (thick filaments/myosin), I-band (thin filaments/actin), and H-zone (myosin-only region) change length during contraction.  
- **Sliding Filament Theory**: During contraction, thin filaments slide over thick filaments, shortening H-zones and I-bands without changing A-band length.  
- **Regulatory Proteins**: Tropomyosin blocks myosin-binding sites on actin in relaxed muscle. Calcium binding to troponin shifts tropomyosin, exposing actin sites.  
- **Myosin Structure**: Myosin heads (not tails) contain actin-binding and ATPase sites. Tails form the thick filament backbone.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Incorrect. H-zones *shorten* during contraction as actin and myosin overlap increases; elongation contradicts this.  
- **Option 2**: Correct. In relaxed muscle, tropomyosin physically blocks myosin from binding to actin. Calcium release reverses this.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. Myosin *heads* (not helical tails) have actin-binding and ATP-hydrolyzing sites. Tails anchor myosin to the thick filament.  
- **Option 4**: Incorrect. Thick filaments are composed of myosin; thin filaments include actin, troponin, and tropomyosin. Troponin and tropomyosin are regulatory, not structural components of the filaments.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  
- Option 2 accurately describes the role of tropomyosin in blocking myosin-actin interaction during relaxation, a core principle of muscle regulation. Other options misrepresent sarcomere dynamics or protein functions.
