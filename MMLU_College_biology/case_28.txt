**1. Question Analysis**
- The question pertains to Hamilton’s rule, a fundamental concept in evolutionary biology that explains the conditions under which altruistic behaviors can evolve. It asks for the specific interpretation of the variable \( r \) in the inequality \( c < br \), where:
  - \( c \) represents the fitness cost to the altruist (donor).
  - \( b \) signifies the fitness benefit to the recipient.
  - \( r \) is the variable in question.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**
- **Hamilton’s Rule:** This rule provides a mathematical condition for the evolution of altruistic traits. It states that an altruistic behavior can spread through a population if the cost to the altruist is less than the benefit to the recipient multiplied by their coefficient of relatedness.
  
- **Coefficient of Relatedness (\( r \)):** This is a measure of the probability that two individuals share a common allele by descent. It quantifies how genetically related two individuals are.

- **Altruism in Evolutionary Biology:** Altruism refers to behaviors that benefit other individuals at a cost to oneself. Hamilton’s rule helps explain how such seemingly self-sacrificial behaviors can evolve if they benefit genetically related individuals, thereby promoting the survival of shared genes.

**3. Analysis of Options**

1. **Coefficient of relatedness**
   - **Evaluation:** This directly corresponds to \( r \) in Hamilton’s rule. It quantifies the genetic relatedness between the altruist and the recipient.
   - **Correctness:** Correct.

2. **Frequency of the altruistic allele**
   - **Evaluation:** While allele frequency is important in population genetics, Hamilton’s rule specifically uses the coefficient of relatedness, not the frequency of alleles, to determine the evolution of altruistic traits.
   - **Correctness:** Incorrect.

3. **Inbreeding coefficient**
   - **Evaluation:** The inbreeding coefficient measures the probability of genetic relatedness due to common ancestry within a population, but it is not the same as the coefficient of relatedness used in Hamilton’s rule.
   - **Correctness:** Incorrect.

4. **Rate of reciprocity**
   - **Evaluation:** Reciprocity involves mutual exchanges that benefit both parties over time. Hamilton’s rule focuses on genetic relatedness rather than reciprocal interactions.
   - **Correctness:** Incorrect.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks for the definition of "r" in Hamilton’s rule, which determines whether an altruistic trait can evolve. The rule states that altruism evolves if the cost to the donor (c) is less than the product of the benefit to the recipient (b) and another factor (r). The answer requires identifying what "r" represents in this context.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Hamilton’s Rule**: This evolutionary concept explains how altruistic behaviors (which reduce the donor’s fitness) can be favored by natural selection if the genetic benefit to relatives outweighs the donor’s loss.  
- **Coefficient of Relatedness (r)**: Measures the probability that two individuals share the same allele due to common ancestry. For example, siblings have an r of 0.5, meaning they share ~50% of their genes.  
- **Kin Selection**: The mechanism where altruism evolves because helping relatives (who carry similar genes) increases the donor’s indirect fitness.  
- **Key Distinctions**:  
  - **Inbreeding Coefficient**: Measures the likelihood of inheriting identical alleles from common ancestors due to close mating, not directly about pairwise relatedness between two individuals.  
  - **Allele Frequency**: Refers to the proportion of a specific allele in a population, unrelated to the genetic relationship between specific individuals.  
  - **Reciprocity**: Involves mutual exchange of benefits (e.g., tit-for-tat), which is a separate mechanism from kin selection.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Coefficient of relatedness)**: Correct. This directly matches the definition of "r" in Hamilton’s rule. The rule explicitly uses relatedness (r) to quantify the genetic link between donor and recipient.  
- **Option 2 (Frequency of the altruistic allele)**: Incorrect. While allele frequency affects population genetics, Hamilton’s rule focuses on the genetic relatedness between specific individuals, not the overall allele frequency in a population.  
- **Option 3 (Inbreeding coefficient)**: Incorrect. The inbreeding coefficient measures the probability of inheriting identical alleles from a shared ancestor but does not quantify pairwise relatedness between two individuals.  
- **Option 4 (Rate of reciprocity)**: Incorrect. Reciprocity involves mutual altruism between non-related individuals, which is governed by different mechanisms (e.g., direct reciprocity) and unrelated to Hamilton’s rule.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**  

The coefficient of relatedness (r) is the correct answer because Hamilton’s rule explicitly uses this term to represent the genetic similarity between donor and recipient. This relationship determines whether the fitness cost to the altruist (c) is offset by the fitness benefit (b)传递 to genetically similar relatives. The other options describe unrelated genetic or behavioral concepts.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks for the biological term represented by "r" in Hamilton’s rule (c < br), which determines the conditions under which altruistic traits evolve. This requires understanding the components of Hamilton’s rule and their biological significance in evolutionary theory.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Hamilton’s rule** explains the evolution of altruism through **kin selection**: altruistic behaviors are favored if the donor’s fitness cost (c) is outweighed by the product of the recipient’s fitness benefit (b) and their genetic relatedness (r).  
- **Coefficient of relatedness (r)** quantifies the probability that two individuals share identical alleles due to common ancestry. For example, siblings have r = 0.5, while cousins have r = 0.125.  
- The rule emphasizes that altruism can evolve if the altruistic allele indirectly increases its own propagation by benefiting genetically related individuals.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Coefficient of relatedness**  
  Correct. Hamilton’s rule explicitly uses "r" to denote genetic relatedness, reflecting the likelihood of shared alleles. This aligns with the equation’s purpose of weighing indirect fitness benefits.  
- **Option 2: Frequency of the altruistic allele**  
  Incorrect. Allele frequency influences population genetics but is not part of Hamilton’s inequality. The rule focuses on relatedness, not allele prevalence.  
- **Option 3: Inbreeding coefficient**  
  Incorrect. The inbreeding coefficient measures the probability of homozygosity due to mating between relatives. It is unrelated to the direct calculation of altruism’s fitness trade-offs.  
- **Option 4: Rate of reciprocity**  
  Incorrect. Reciprocity involves mutual exchange of benefits (reciprocal altruism), which is distinct from kin selection. Hamilton’s rule does not incorporate reciprocity rates.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The correct answer is **Option 1**, as "r" in Hamilton’s rule specifically refers to the coefficient of relatedness, which quantifies genetic overlap between donor and recipient. This is foundational to kin selection theory.  

**My final selection is: Option 1**
