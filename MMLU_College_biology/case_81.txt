**1. Question Analysis**
- The question is asking which laboratory technique can be utilized to demonstrate the binding of proteins to specific DNA sequences. This involves understanding methods that can detect or analyze interactions between proteins and DNA.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**
- **Protein-DNA Interactions:** Proteins, such as transcription factors, bind to specific DNA sequences to regulate gene expression. Demonstrating this binding is crucial in understanding gene regulation mechanisms.
- **Blotting Techniques:**
  - **Southern Blot:** Detects specific DNA sequences within a DNA sample.
  - **Northern Blot:** Detects specific RNA sequences.
  - **Western Blot:** Detects specific proteins.
- **Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA):** Also known as a gel shift assay, EMSA is used to study protein-DNA interactions by observing the mobility shift of DNA when bound by proteins during electrophoresis.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Western blot hybridization**
   - **Incorrect:** Western blotting is primarily used to detect specific proteins in a sample. It does not provide information about protein-DNA interactions.
2. **Northern blot hybridization**
   - **Incorrect:** Northern blotting is used to detect specific RNA sequences, not protein-DNA interactions.
3. **Southern blot hybridization**
   - **Incorrect:** Southern blotting is designed to detect specific DNA sequences. While it involves DNA, it does not directly assess protein binding to DNA.
4. **Electrophoretic mobility shift assay**
   - **Correct:** EMSA is specifically designed to study protein-DNA interactions. It detects the binding of proteins to specific DNA sequences by observing the resulting shift in DNA migration during electrophoresis.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 4**

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which technique demonstrates the interaction between proteins and specific DNA sequences. This requires knowledge of molecular biology techniques used to study protein-DNA interactions, such as those involved in transcription regulation, DNA replication, or repair.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Protein-DNA Interactions**: Techniques must directly or indirectly show physical binding between proteins and DNA.  
- **Western Blot**: Detects specific proteins using antibodies but does not assess DNA binding.  
- **Northern Blot**: Detects RNA abundance via hybridization with probes, unrelated to protein-DNA interactions.  
- **Southern Blot**: Detects specific DNA sequences via hybridization with probes, unrelated to protein binding.  
- **Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)**: Measures protein-DNA binding by observing shifts in DNA mobility on a gel when bound to proteins.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Western blot hybridization)**: Incorrect. Western blots detect proteins via antibodies but do not assess their binding to DNA.  
- **Option 2 (Northern blot hybridization)**: Incorrect. Northern blots analyze RNA levels, not protein-DNA interactions.  
- **Option 3 (Southern blot hybridization)**: Incorrect. Southern blots identify DNA sequences via hybridization, not protein binding.  
- **Option 4 (Electrophoretic mobility shift assay)**: Correct. EMSA directly detects protein-DNA binding by observing mobility shifts of DNA fragments in a gel when bound to proteins.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  

EMSA is the only technique listed that directly demonstrates protein binding to DNA by measuring changes in electrophoretic mobility due to the formation of protein-DNA complexes. The other options are unrelated to detecting protein-DNA interactions.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which experimental technique can demonstrate that a protein binds to a specific DNA sequence. This involves understanding methods that detect **DNA-protein interactions**, particularly those identifying sequence-specific binding.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **DNA-protein binding assays** require detecting physical interactions between proteins and DNA.  
- **Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)** exploits the reduced mobility of protein-bound DNA in a gel compared to free DNA, confirming binding.  
- **Blotting techniques** (Western, Northern, Southern) primarily detect biomolecules (proteins, RNA, DNA) but not direct interactions between them.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Western blot hybridization**  
  Detects specific proteins using antibodies. While it identifies proteins, it does not assess DNA binding. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 2: Northern blot hybridization**  
  Identifies RNA molecules via hybridization probes. Irrelevant to DNA-protein interactions. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 3: Southern blot hybridization**  
  Detects specific DNA sequences using probes. While it identifies DNA, it does not test protein binding. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 4: Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)**  
  Directly visualizes DNA-protein complexes by observing shifted DNA bands in a gel. **Correct**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The only method designed to detect protein binding to specific DNA sequences is EMSA. Blotting techniques lack the capability to assess such interactions.  

**My final selection is: Option 4**
