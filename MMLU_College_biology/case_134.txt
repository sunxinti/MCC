GPT的完整回答:
================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks why geneticists utilize mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) specifically to assess the relatedness among animal populations. It focuses on understanding the properties of mtDNA that make it suitable for studying genetic relatedness.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Mitochondrial Inheritance:** mtDNA is typically inherited maternally, meaning it's passed from mother to offspring without contribution from the paternal side.
- **Lack of Recombination:** Unlike nuclear DNA, mtDNA does not undergo recombination, preserving the genetic sequence across generations.
- **Mutation Rate:** mtDNA often has a higher mutation rate compared to nuclear DNA, providing more genetic markers for studying evolution and relatedness.
- **Genetic Composition:** While mtDNA contains genes essential for mitochondrial function, most mitochondrial proteins are encoded by nuclear DNA, not mtDNA.

**3. Analysis of Options**

1. **mtDNA mutates at a slower rate than nuclear DNA.**
   - *Incorrect.* mtDNA typically has a higher mutation rate than nuclear DNA, making it useful for studying genetic differences over shorter evolutionary timescales.

2. **mtDNA is passed from mother to child and is free from recombination that occurs between pairs of chromosomes.**
   - *Correct.* The maternal inheritance and lack of recombination make mtDNA a reliable marker for tracing lineage and relatedness.

3. **There are few single nucleotide polymorphisms in the hypervariable, noncoding regions.**
   - *Incorrect.* The hypervariable regions of mtDNA actually contain numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which are valuable for population genetics studies.

4. **All mitochondrial proteins are coded for by mitochondrial genes.**
   - *Incorrect.* Only a small number of mitochondrial proteins are encoded by mtDNA; the majority are coded by nuclear genes.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks why geneticists use mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to study the relatedness of animal populations. The focus is on identifying a key advantage of mtDNA for such studies, likely related to its inheritance pattern, mutation rate, or genetic structure.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Maternal Inheritance**: mtDNA is exclusively inherited from the mother, avoiding the mixing of paternal and maternal nuclear DNA.  
- **No Recombination**: Unlike nuclear DNA, mtDNA does not undergo recombination during meiosis, so mutations accumulate linearly.  
- **Mutation Rate**: mtDNA typically has a higher mutation rate than nuclear DNA, though this depends on the region (e.g., coding vs. noncoding regions).  
- **Hypervariable Regions**: Noncoding regions (e.g., control regions) of mtDNA are rich in single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), making them useful for tracing recent evolutionary changes.  
- **Genetic Coding**: Only a small subset of mitochondrial proteins are encoded by mtDNA; most are nuclear-encoded.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: "mtDNA mutates at a slower rate than nuclear DNA."  
  **Incorrect**. mtDNA generally has a higher mutation rate than nuclear DNA due to limited repair mechanisms and exposure to reactive oxygen species. This makes it useful for studying recent evolutionary changes but contradicts the claim of slower mutation.  

- **Option 2**: "mtDNA is passed from mother to child and is free from recombination that occurs between pairs of chromosomes."  
  **Correct**. mtDNA’s maternal inheritance and absence of recombination simplify tracking lineage-specific mutations. This lack of recombination ensures that mtDNA mutations accumulate in a linear fashion, making it ideal for phylogenetic and population studies.  

- **Option 3**: "There are few single nucleotide polymorphisms in the hypervariable, noncoding regions."  
  **Incorrect**. Hypervariable regions (e.g., D-loop) are characterized by high SNP density, which is why they are used to study recent population diversification. The claim of "few" SNPs directly contradicts this.  

- **Option 4**: "All mitochondrial proteins are coded for by mitochondrial genes."  
  **Incorrect**. Only ~13 proteins in mitochondria are encoded by mtDNA; the vast majority are nuclear-encoded and imported into mitochondria.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  
mtDNA is ideal for studying population relatedness because it is maternally inherited and does not undergo recombination. This inheritance pattern ensures that mtDNA mutations are passed intact from mother to offspring, allowing geneticists to trace maternal lineages and compare populations without the complexity of recombination or paternal DNA contributions. This makes mtDNA particularly useful for phylogenetic analysis and understanding evolutionary relationships.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks for the reason geneticists use mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to study animal population relatedness. This involves understanding mtDNA's unique properties compared to nuclear DNA and its utility in evolutionary and population studies.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Maternal inheritance**: mtDNA is inherited exclusively from the mother, avoiding paternal contributions.  
- **Lack of recombination**: Unlike nuclear DNA, mtDNA does not undergo recombination during sexual reproduction.  
- **Mutation rate**: mtDNA generally mutates faster than nuclear DNA due to limited repair mechanisms.  
- **Hypervariable regions**: Noncoding regions of mtDNA accumulate mutations rapidly, providing population-specific markers.  
- **Mitochondrial gene content**: Most mitochondrial proteins are nuclear-encoded; mtDNA primarily codes for a subset of electron transport chain components and rRNA/tRNA.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Incorrect. mtDNA mutates at a *faster* rate than nuclear DNA, making it useful for studying recent evolutionary divergence.  
- **Option 2**: Correct. Maternal inheritance ensures a direct, unbroken lineage trace, and the absence of recombination simplifies phylogenetic analysis by eliminating genetic mixing.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. Hypervariable regions are characterized by *numerous* single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which are critical for distinguishing populations.  
- **Option 4**: Incorrect. Only 13 proteins in humans are mtDNA-encoded; the majority are nuclear-encoded.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The correct answer is **Option 2**, as it accurately reflects the maternal inheritance and lack of recombination in mtDNA, which are key advantages for studying population relatedness.  

**My final selection is: Option 2**
