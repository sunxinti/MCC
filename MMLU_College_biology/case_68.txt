**1. Question Analysis**  
The question seeks to identify a distinguishing characteristic that sets angiosperms apart from gymnosperms. It requires understanding the fundamental differences between these two major groups of seed-producing plants.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
Angiosperms, commonly known as flowering plants, are characterized by the presence of flowers and fruits. A crucial feature of angiosperms is that their seeds are enclosed within an ovary, which typically develops into fruit. In contrast, gymnosperms, such as conifers, do not produce flowers or fruits; their seeds are exposed on surfaces like cones. Both angiosperms and gymnosperms can exhibit perennial growth, possess true roots, and undergo apical growth, making these traits common rather than distinguishing features.

**3. Analysis of Options**  

1. **Perennial growth**  
   - **Evaluation:** Both angiosperms and gymnosperms can be perennial plants.  
   - **Conclusion:** This characteristic does not distinguish between the two groups.

2. **True roots**  
   - **Evaluation:** Both groups develop true roots as part of their vascular system.  
   - **Conclusion:** This characteristic is common to both and does not serve as a distinguishing factor.

3. **Apical growth**  
   - **Evaluation:** Apical growth, involving the growth of plant parts from the tips of roots and shoots, is present in both angiosperms and gymnosperms.  
   - **Conclusion:** This trait is not unique to either group.

4. **Seeds enclosed in ovaries**  
   - **Evaluation:** Angiosperms uniquely enclose their seeds within an ovary, which matures into fruit. Gymnosperms expose their seeds without any enclosing structure.  
   - **Conclusion:** This is a distinctive feature that differentiates angiosperms from gymnosperms.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks to identify a characteristic unique to angiosperms compared to gymnosperms. This requires understanding the defining features of these two plant groups and their evolutionary differences. Angiosperms (flowering plants) and gymnosperms (cone-bearing plants) are both seed plants but differ in key reproductive structures.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Angiosperms**: Characterized by flowers, fruits, and seeds enclosed within an ovary (carpel). The fruit develops from the ovary to protect and disperse seeds.  
- **Gymnosperms**: Produce seeds in cones (e.g., pine cones), with seeds exposed on the cone scales. They lack flowers and fruits.  
- **Evolutionary Context**: The enclosed seed (within an ovary) is a derived trait of angiosperms, distinguishing them from gymnosperms and earlier plant groups.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Perennial growth)**: Both angiosperms and gymnosperms include perennial species (e.g., oak trees [angiosperm] and pine trees [gymnosperm]). This is not a distinguishing feature.  
- **Option 2 (True roots)**: Both groups have true roots. Root systems evolved in earlier plant groups (e.g., vascular plants like ferns and gymnosperms), so this is not unique to angiosperms.  
- **Option 3 (Apical growth)**: Both angiosperms and gymnosperms exhibit apical growth via apical meristems at shoot tips. This is a shared trait in land plants.  
- **Option 4 (Seeds enclosed in ovaries)**: This is the defining feature of angiosperms. Gymnosperm seeds are not enclosed in ovaries but are exposed on cone scales. Only angiosperms form fruits from ovaries to enclose seeds.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  

The correct answer is **seeds enclosed in ovaries**, as this is the hallmark trait of angiosperms that distinguishes them from gymnosperms. Gymnosperms lack ovaries and instead produce裸seeds in cones. The other options describe traits common to both groups or unrelated to their classification.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks for a characteristic unique to angiosperms that differentiates them from gymnosperms. This requires understanding key structural and reproductive differences between these two groups of seed plants.  

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Angiosperms** (flowering plants) produce seeds enclosed within an ovary, which matures into a fruit.  
- **Gymnosperms** (e.g., conifers, cycads) produce "naked" seeds, typically on cone scales, without enclosure in an ovary.  
- Critical distinctions include reproductive structures (flowers vs. cones), seed enclosure, and fruit formation.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Perennial growth**  
  Both angiosperms (e.g., oak trees) and gymnosperms (e.g., pine trees) include perennial species. **Incorrect**.  

- **Option 2: True roots**  
  Both groups possess true roots (vascular tissue, root systems). **Incorrect**.  

- **Option 3: Apical growth**  
  Apical meristems enable primary growth in all vascular plants, including both groups. **Incorrect**.  

- **Option 4: Seeds enclosed in ovaries**  
  Angiosperms uniquely develop seeds within ovaries (later forming fruits), while gymnosperms lack ovaries and expose seeds on cones. **Correct**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The defining feature of angiosperms is the enclosure of seeds within ovaries, a trait absent in gymnosperms. This aligns with their reproductive adaptations (flowers and fruits).  

**My final selection is: Option 4**
