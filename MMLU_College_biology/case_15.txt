**1. Question Analysis**  
The question addresses the cellular and molecular events that occur in sea urchin oocytes to prevent polyspermy following fertilization. Specifically, it focuses on the role of intracellular calcium in triggering the release of proteolytic enzymes that block additional sperm from entering the oocyte.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Polyspermy Prevention:** After a sperm fertilizes an oocyte, mechanisms are activated to prevent additional sperm from entering, ensuring normal embryonic development.
- **Intracellular Calcium Rise:** A surge in intracellular calcium levels is a universal signal in many species that initiates the block to polyspermy.
- **Release of Proteolytic Enzymes:** In sea urchins, this calcium signal triggers the exocytosis of cortical granules, which release enzymes that modify the egg's extracellular matrix, preventing additional sperm from binding or fusing.
- **Relevant Processes:**
  - **Cortical Reaction:** Involves the release of cortical granules from the oocyte to alter the extracellular matrix.
  - **Acrosomal Reaction:** Pertains to changes in the sperm necessary for it to penetrate the egg, not directly related to polyspermy prevention.
  - **Zona Reaction:** Similar to the cortical reaction but specific to mammals, involving the modification of the zona pellucida.
  - **Fertilization Reaction:** A broader term that includes all events post-sperm-egg fusion.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Zona Reaction:** This process occurs in mammalian eggs where the zona pellucida is modified to prevent additional sperm binding. However, sea urchins do not have a zona pellucida; instead, they utilize cortical granules for a similar purpose.  
   **Incorrect**

2. **Acrosomal Reaction:** This reaction involves changes in the sperm's acrosome to facilitate penetration of the egg's outer layers. It is a sperm-mediated process and does not directly relate to the oocyte's mechanisms for preventing polyspermy.  
   **Incorrect**

3. **Cortical Reaction:** This is the process in which cortical granules within the oocyte are released upon fertilization, leading to modifications in the egg's extracellular matrix to block additional sperm entry. This directly corresponds to the events described in the question.  
   **Correct**

4. **Fertilization Reaction:** While this term encompasses all events following sperm-egg fusion, it is too broad and does not specifically describe the mechanism preventing polyspermy triggered by calcium-induced enzyme release.  
   **Incorrect**

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question focuses on the mechanism that prevents polyspermy in sea urchin oocytes after fertilization. Specifically, it asks which process involves a calcium-dependent release of proteolytic enzymes to block additional sperm entry. The key concepts here are calcium signaling, protease release, and polyspermy prevention in fertilization biology.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Cortical Reaction**: In sea urchins and many other organisms, the cortical reaction is triggered by sperm-egg fusion. This involves an increase in intracellular calcium, which causes cortical granules in the oocyte to release enzymes (e.g., proteases). These enzymes modify the vitelline layer (analogous to the zona pellucida in mammals), preventing other sperm from binding and penetrating, thus blocking polyspermy.  
- **Zona Reaction**: In mammals, the zona reaction refers to similar modifications of the zona pellucida following fertilization, but the term is species-specific and less applicable to sea urchins.  
- **Acrosomal Reaction**: Occurs in sperm, where the acrosome releases enzymes to digest the outer layers of the egg, enabling fusion. This is unrelated to polyspermy prevention.  
- **Fertilization Reaction**: A general term for the overall process of fertilization but not the specific mechanism described here.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Zona reaction)**: Incorrect. While the zona reaction in mammals involves polyspermy prevention, sea urchins lack a zona pellucida. The process in sea urchins is called the cortical reaction.  
- **Option 2 (Acrosomal reaction)**: Incorrect. This describes the sperm’s enzymatic digestion of the egg’s outer layers, a step preceding fertilization, not the oocyte’s response to prevent polyspermy.  
- **Option 3 (Cortical reaction)**: Correct. Directly describes the calcium-triggered release of cortical granules’ proteolytic enzymes to block polyspermy in sea urchins.  
- **Option 4 (Fertilization reaction)**: Incorrect. Too broad and non-specific; does not refer to the calcium-dependent cortical granule release mechanism.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  
The cortical reaction is the precise term for the calcium-dependent release of cortical granules’ enzymes in sea urchin oocytes, which modifies the vitelline layer to prevent polyspermy. This matches the question’s description perfectly. The other options either describe unrelated processes (acrosomal reaction), species-specific mechanisms (zona reaction in mammals), or are overly general (fertilization reaction).

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which biological reaction involves a rise in intracellular calcium in the sea urchin oocyte, triggering proteolytic enzyme release to prevent polyspermy. This focuses on fertilization mechanisms and specific cellular responses to block multiple sperm entry.  

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Polyspermy prevention** involves two main mechanisms:  
  1. **Fast block**: Transient depolarization of the egg membrane.  
  2. **Slow block (cortical reaction)**: Calcium-dependent release of cortical granule contents, modifying the egg's extracellular matrix to block additional sperm.  
- **Cortical granules** (in the egg cortex) release enzymes (e.g., proteases) that degrade sperm-binding proteins and harden the vitelline layer (in sea urchins) or zona pellucida (in mammals).  
- The **calcium wave** is a hallmark of egg activation and directly triggers the cortical reaction.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Zona reaction)**: Incorrect. The zona reaction occurs in mammals, hardening the zona pellucida via cortical granule enzymes. Sea urchins lack a zona pellucida; they have a vitelline layer modified by the cortical reaction.  
- **Option 2 (Acrosomal reaction)**: Incorrect. This describes the sperm’s release of acrosomal enzymes to penetrate the egg’s outer layers, unrelated to the egg’s polyspermy-blocking mechanism.  
- **Option 3 (Cortical reaction)**: Correct. The calcium surge triggers cortical granule exocytosis, releasing proteolytic enzymes that alter the vitelline layer (e.g., forming the fertilization envelope in sea urchins), preventing polyspermy.  
- **Option 4 (Fertilization reaction)**: Incorrect. This is a vague term not specifically tied to calcium signaling or proteolytic enzyme release in standard biological terminology.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  
The cortical reaction is the definitive process where calcium release activates cortical granules to secrete enzymes that modify the egg’s extracellular matrix, directly preventing polyspermy in sea urchins. This matches the question’s description of intracellular calcium rise and proteolytic enzyme action.
