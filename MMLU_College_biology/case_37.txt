问题: 
Aggressive ants live in the swollen thorns of a small tropical tree and feed on oil-rich bodies that the tree produces at the tips of its leaflets. Which of the following experiments best tests the hypothesis that ants defend the plant by either killing or chasing away leaf-feeding insects?
选项: 
1. Remove ants and measure subsequent leaf damage.
2. Remove oil-rich bodies and measure subsequent ant density.
3. Remove the thorns and measure subsequent density of ants.
4. Remove leaf-feeding insects and measure subsequent ant density.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question is investigating the mutualistic relationship between aggressive ants and a tropical tree. Specifically, it seeks to test the hypothesis that ants protect the tree by deterring or eliminating leaf-feeding insects. The focus is on designing an experiment that directly evaluates the defensive role of ants in relation to leaf damage caused by herbivores.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Mutualism:** A symbiotic relationship where both species benefit. Here, ants receive oil-rich bodies from the tree, and in return, they defend the tree against herbivores.
- **Defense Mechanism:** The hypothesis suggests that ants protect the plant by killing or repelling leaf-feeding insects, thereby reducing herbivory.
- **Experimental Controls:** To test the hypothesis, it's essential to manipulate the presence of ants and observe any changes in leaf damage, isolating the effect of ants on plant defense.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Remove ants and measure subsequent leaf damage.**  
   - **Correctness:** This directly tests the hypothesis by observing whether the absence of ants leads to increased leaf damage.
   - **Biological Basis:** If ants are defending the plant, their removal should result in more herbivory.

2. **Remove oil-rich bodies and measure subsequent ant density.**  
   - **Incorrectness:** This tests the dependency of ants on the plant's oil bodies but does not directly assess the defensive role of ants against leaf-feeders.

3. **Remove the thorns and measure subsequent density of ants.**  
   - **Incorrectness:** Removing thorns might affect ant habitation but does not directly test the defensive hypothesis regarding leaf damage.

4. **Remove leaf-feeding insects and measure subsequent ant density.**  
   - **Incorrectness:** This assesses the impact of prey availability on ant populations but does not evaluate the ants' defensive role.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which experiment best tests the hypothesis that ants defend their host plant by reducing damage from leaf-feeding insects. This involves understanding mutualistic relationships and experimental design to isolate cause-and-effect.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Mutualism**: The ants and plant likely have a mutualistic relationship, where the plant provides ants with swollen thorns (housing) and oil-rich bodies (food), while the ants protect the plant from herbivores.  
- **Experimental Design**: To test whether ants provide defense, the experiment must manipulate the ants' presence and measure the outcome on herbivory. A controlled exclusion experiment (removing ants and observing changes) is typically used to isolate the effect of one partner on the other.  
- **Cause-and-Effect**: The hypothesis specifically links ant presence to reduced leaf damage. Removing ants and observing increased damage would directly support this, while other manipulations may test different aspects of the relationship.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Removing ants and measuring leaf damage directly tests the hypothesis. If ants defend the plant, their absence should correlate with increased herbivore activity and damage. This is a classic exclusion experiment to assess the ants' protective role.  
- **Option 2**: Removing oil-rich bodies (the ants' food source) would test whether the ants remain on the plant without their reward. However, this does not directly measure whether ants reduce herbivory; it only assesses the ants' dependency on the plant. Even if ants leave, it does not confirm they were defending the plant.  
- **Option 3**: Removing swollen thorns (the ants' habitat) would similarly test the ants' dependency on the plant. Reduced ant density might indicate habitat loss, but this does not address whether ants were actively defending against insects.  
- **Option 4**: Removing leaf-feeding insects first eliminates the variable the hypothesis seeks to measure (damage caused by insects). Without the insects, the experiment cannot determine whether ants were responsible for their absence or reduced damage.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**  
Option 1 is the most accurate because it directly tests the hypothesis by experimentally removing the ants and observing whether leaf damage increases. This approach isolates the ants' role in defense, whereas the other options focus on the ants' dependency on the plant’s resources (Options 2 and 3) or lack a control for herbivore presence (Option 4). The exclusion method ensures that any observed change in damage is attributable to the absence of ants.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which experiment best tests the hypothesis that ants defend the plant by reducing leaf-feeding insects. The core biological concept is experimental design to establish causation between ants (independent variable) and plant defense (dependent variable).  

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- Mutualism: Ants receive food/resources (oil-rich bodies) and shelter (thorns), while the plant potentially gains protection.  
- Hypothesis testing: To confirm ants act as defenders, the experiment must isolate their presence/absence and measure the effect on leaf damage (a proxy for herbivory).  
- Controlled variables: Other factors (e.g., plant health, environmental conditions) should remain constant to attribute changes in leaf damage to ant activity.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Removing ants and measuring leaf damage directly tests causation. If leaf damage increases post-removal, it supports the hypothesis. This isolates the independent variable (ants) and measures the dependent variable (damage).  
- **Option 2**: Removing oil-rich bodies tests ant density dependence on food supply, not their defensive role. Irrelevant to the hypothesis.  
- **Option 3**: Removing thorns tests habitat dependence of ants, not their defensive behavior. Does not link ants to plant protection.  
- **Option 4**: Removing leaf-feeding insects tests how prey availability affects ant density, reversing the hypothesized causal relationship. Does not address ants' defensive function.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**  
This option directly manipulates the presence of ants (the proposed defenders) and measures the outcome (leaf damage). Increased damage in their absence would confirm their protective role, aligning with the hypothesis. Other options focus on tangential relationships (food/habitat dependence) or reverse causality.
