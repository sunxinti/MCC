问题: 
A recent theory concerning an unusual rise in asthma attacks following a thunderstorm proposes that while pollen grains at 5 microns are too large to enter the airways, their exposure to water precipitates the release of starch granules as a result of osmotic shock. The starch granules are small enough to enter the lower airways and trigger an asthmatic attack. If this theory is true, which of the following is a correct statement?
选项: 
1. The interior of the pollen grains was hypotonic compared to the surrounding environment.
2. The interior of the pollen grains had a higher osmotic pressure than did the surrounding environment.
3. The pollen grains underwent plasmolysis prior to releasing their contents.
4. The pollen grains underwent shrinking before they ruptured and released their contents.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question explores a theory explaining the increase in asthma attacks following a thunderstorm. It focuses on the behavior of pollen grains exposed to water, leading to the release of starch granules due to osmotic shock. The key biological concept involves osmosis and osmotic pressure differences between the interior of pollen grains and their surrounding environment.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Osmosis:** The movement of water across a semipermeable membrane from a region of lower solute concentration to higher solute concentration.
- **Osmotic Pressure:** The pressure required to prevent water from moving into the more concentrated solution.
- **Hypotonic and Hypertonic Solutions:**
  - *Hypotonic:* Lower solute concentration outside the cell, leading to water entering the cell.
  - *Hypertonic:* Higher solute concentration outside the cell, causing water to exit the cell.
- **Plasmolysis:** The process where cells lose water in a hypertonic environment, leading to cell shrinking.
- **Osmotic Shock:** A sudden change in solute concentration surrounding a cell, causing rapid movement of water and potential cell rupture.

**3. Analysis of Options**

1. **The interior of the pollen grains was hypotonic compared to the surrounding environment.**
   - *Analysis:* If the interior were hypotonic, water would move into the pollen grains when exposed to the surrounding environment. This influx could cause the grains to swell and potentially rupture, aligning with the theory.
   - *Conclusion:* Potentially correct.

2. **The interior of the pollen grains had a higher osmotic pressure than did the surrounding environment.**
   - *Analysis:* A higher osmotic pressure inside means the interior is hypertonic relative to the environment. Water would move into the grains, causing them to swell and possibly rupture, which supports the theory.
   - *Conclusion:* Correct.

3. **The pollen grains underwent plasmolysis prior to releasing their contents.**
   - *Analysis:* Plasmolysis refers to cell shrinking due to water loss in a hypertonic environment. However, the theory suggests water entering the grains, not leaving, making plasmolysis inconsistent with the scenario.
   - *Conclusion:* Incorrect.

4. **The pollen grains underwent shrinking before they ruptured and released their contents.**
   - *Analysis:* Shrinking implies water loss, which contradicts the scenario where water enters the grains causing them to swell and rupture.
   - *Conclusion:* Incorrect.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question explores the mechanism behind asthma attacks post-thunderstorms, focusing on osmotic shock in pollen grains. The key concepts involve osmosis, osmotic pressure, and cellular responses to environmental changes.  

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Osmosis and Osmotic Pressure**: Water moves across semipermeable membranes from regions of lower solute concentration (hypotonic) to higher solute concentration (hypertonic). Osmotic pressure is the pressure required to prevent water movement.  
- **Pollen Grain Structure**: Pollen grains are plant cells with a rigid cell wall. Their internal solute concentration determines their response to external water exposure.  
- **Osmotic Shock**: A sudden influx or outflux of water causing cellular damage. If the pollen’s interior is hypertonic relative to its environment (e.g., rainwater), water rushes in, swelling and rupturing the pollen, releasing starch granules.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: "The interior of the pollen grains was hypotonic compared to the surrounding environment."  
  - If the interior were hypotonic (lower solute), water would leave the pollen, causing shrinkage. This contradicts the scenario where water influx ruptures the pollen. **Incorrect**.  

- **Option 2**: "The interior of the pollen grains had a higher osmotic pressure than did the surrounding environment."  
  - Higher osmotic pressure implies higher solute concentration in the pollen. When exposed to rainwater (hypotonic), water rushes in, causing rupture. This aligns with osmotic shock leading to starch release. **Correct**.  

- **Option 3**: "The pollen grains underwent plasmolysis prior to releasing their contents."  
  - Plasmolysis occurs when a cell loses water and the membrane pulls away from the cell wall (hypertonic environment). Rainwater is hypotonic, so plasmolysis would not occur. **Incorrect**.  

- **Option 4**: "The pollen grains underwent shrinking before they ruptured and released their contents."  
  - Shrinking requires water loss (hypertonic environment). Here, water influx causes swelling and rupture, not shrinking. **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  
The pollen’s interior must have a higher solute concentration (hypertonic) than the surrounding rainwater. This creates a higher osmotic pressure inside, driving water into the pollen, causing it to swell and rupture. This mechanism explains the release of starch granules, consistent with the theory.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question examines the mechanism of osmotic shock in pollen grains during a thunderstorm, linking it to asthma attacks. The correct answer hinges on understanding how osmotic pressure gradients and water movement affect pollen grain integrity.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Osmotic shock** occurs when cells experience rapid osmotic imbalance, leading to rupture.  
- In a **hypotonic environment** (external solution has lower solute concentration than the cell interior), water enters the cell, causing swelling and potential lysis.  
- **Hypertonic environments** cause water to exit, leading to plasmolysis (cell shrinkage).  
- Pollen grains bursting due to water uptake implies their interior was hypertonic relative to the rainwater during the storm.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Incorrect. If the interior were hypotonic (lower solute concentration), the environment would be hypertonic, causing water to leave the pollen (plasmolysis), not rupture.  
- **Option 2**: Correct. Higher osmotic pressure inside the pollen (hypertonic interior) means water enters via osmosis, leading to swelling and rupture. This aligns with osmotic shock causing starch release.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. Plasmolysis occurs in hypertonic environments, where cells lose water and shrink. The scenario describes water influx, not loss.  
- **Option 4**: Incorrect. Shrinking (plasmolysis) precedes rupture only in hypertonic conditions. Here, pollen swells and bursts due to hypotonic conditions.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  
The theory requires pollen grains to absorb water until they rupture, which occurs only if their interior has higher osmotic pressure (hypertonic) than the surrounding rainwater. This explains osmotic shock-driven starch release.
