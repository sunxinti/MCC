**1. Question Analysis**  
The question is asking which factor among the given options does **not** promote linkage disequilibrium in a population. Linkage disequilibrium refers to the non-random association of alleles at different loci. Understanding which factors influence this phenomenon is crucial for predicting genetic variation and evolution within populations.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
Linkage disequilibrium (LD) is influenced by several factors:

- **Reproductive Mode:** Asexual reproduction can maintain LD because there is no recombination to break up allele combinations.
  
- **Coadapted Gene Complexes:** Groups of alleles that work well together can be maintained in LD.
  
- **Epistasis:** Interaction between different genes can sustain specific allele combinations, promoting LD.
  
- **Random Mating:** Introduces genetic shuffling through recombination, which tends to break down LD.

**3. Analysis of Options**

1. **Asexual reproduction**  
   - **Effect on LD:** Promotes linkage disequilibrium.
   - **Reasoning:** Without recombination, allele combinations are preserved across generations, maintaining LD.

2. **Coadapted gene complexes**  
   - **Effect on LD:** Promotes linkage disequilibrium.
   - **Reasoning:** Favorable allele combinations are maintained together, sustaining LD.

3. **Epistasis**  
   - **Effect on LD:** Promotes linkage disequilibrium.
   - **Reasoning:** Interacting genes can maintain specific allele combinations, reinforcing LD.

4. **Random mating**  
   - **Effect on LD:** Does **not** promote linkage disequilibrium.
   - **Reasoning:** Random mating leads to recombination, which tends to break down existing allele associations, reducing LD.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which factor does *not* promote linkage disequilibrium (LD). Linkage disequilibrium occurs when alleles at different loci are associated non-randomly in a population, often due to factors that reduce recombination or maintain specific allele combinations. The task is to identify the option that does not contribute to this association.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Linkage disequilibrium (LD)**: LD arises when alleles at different loci are inherited together more often than expected by chance. Factors promoting LD include reduced recombination (e.g., in asexual organisms), selection favoring specific allele combinations (e.g., coadapted gene complexes or epistatic interactions), and non-random mating.  
- **Random mating**: Under random mating, alleles combine independently, which tends to reduce LD over time unless counteracted by other factors (e.g., selection or low recombination). Random mating is a condition assumed in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, where allele frequencies stabilize but LD can still exist if loci are physically linked.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Asexual reproduction**:  
   - Asexual reproduction lacks recombination, so alleles at linked loci remain associated across generations. This *promotes* LD.  

2. **Coadapted gene complexes**:  
   - These are groups of alleles that function synergistically. Selection favoring these combinations reduces recombination between loci, *promoting* LD.  

3. **Epistasis**:  
   - Epistatic interactions can create selective pressures that maintain specific allele combinations, *promoting* LD.  

4. **Random mating**:  
   - Random mating assumes alleles combine independently. While it does not *directly* break down LD (recombination does that), it does not *promote* LD either. Instead, it is neutral or slightly reduces LD by allowing independent assortment.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  

Random mating does *not* promote linkage disequilibrium. Unlike the other options, which either reduce recombination or favor specific allele combinations, random mating allows alleles to assort independently. While LD can persist due to other factors (e.g., physical linkage), random mating itself does not actively maintain or enhance LD. Instead, it aligns with conditions that allow LD to be broken down over time by recombination, making it the correct answer.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which factor does **not** promote linkage disequilibrium (LD), a state where alleles at different loci are inherited together more frequently than expected by chance. The answer requires identifying the option that disrupts or fails to maintain non-random allele associations.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Linkage Disequilibrium (LD)** arises when specific allele combinations persist across generations due to factors like limited recombination, selection for coadapted alleles, or population structure.  
- **Promoters of LD** include mechanisms that reduce recombination (e.g., asexual reproduction), selection for advantageous allele combinations (e.g., coadapted gene complexes), or epistatic interactions that favor specific allele pairings.  
- **Reducers of LD** include processes like random mating (which increases recombination and shuffles alleles) and genetic recombination during sexual reproduction.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Asexual reproduction**  
  Asexual reproduction eliminates recombination, preserving existing allele combinations. This strongly **promotes LD**.  

- **Option 2: Coadapted gene complexes**  
  Alleles in coadapted complexes are under selection to remain linked, as their combined effects enhance fitness. This **maintains LD**.  

- **Option 3: Epistasis**  
  Epistasis creates fitness dependencies between loci, favoring specific allele combinations through natural selection. This **reinforces LD**.  

- **Option 4: Random mating**  
  Random mating increases genetic mixing, allowing recombination to break down non-random allele associations. This **reduces LD** over time.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The only factor that actively disrupts linkage disequilibrium is **random mating**, as it enables recombination and dilutes allele associations. All other options either prevent recombination (asexual reproduction) or select for allele combinations (coadapted complexes, epistasis).  

**My final selection is: Option 4**
