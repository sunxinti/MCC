**1. Question Analysis**
- The question seeks to identify a common feature shared by members of the phyla Annelida (annelids) and Arthropoda (arthropods). The focus is on determining which of the provided options accurately reflects a shared biological characteristic between these two diverse groups.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**
- **Body Segmentation:** Both annelids and arthropods exhibit segmented bodies. Annelids show segmentation in their body structure with repeated segments along their length, while arthropods display segmentation in key body regions like the head, thorax, and abdomen.
- **Circulatory Systems:** Annelids typically possess an open circulatory system, whereas arthropods have a closed circulatory system.
- **Gas Exchange:** Annelids often rely on diffusion across moist surfaces for gas exchange. In contrast, arthropods utilize specialized respiratory structures such as tracheae.
- **Sense Organs:** Arthropods generally have well-developed sense organs, including compound eyes and antennae. Annelids have simpler sensory structures and lack the complex sense organs found in arthropods.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Have Segmented Bodies**
   - **Annelids:** Exhibit clear body segmentation with repeated internal structures.
   - **Arthropods:** Display segmentation in their exoskeleton, divided into regions like the head, thorax, and abdomen.
   - **Conclusion:** Both phyla share the characteristic of having segmented bodies. **(Correct)**
2. **Have a Closed Circulatory System**
   - **Annelids:** Possess an open circulatory system.
   - **Arthropods:** Have a closed circulatory system.
   - **Conclusion:** The circulatory systems differ between the two phyla. **(Incorrect)**
3. **Conduct Gas Exchange by Diffusion Through a Moist Membrane**
   - **Annelids:** Utilize diffusion for gas exchange through their moist body surfaces.
   - **Arthropods:** Rely on tracheal systems for gas exchange, not simple diffusion.
   - **Conclusion:** Gas exchange mechanisms are different. **(Incorrect)**
4. **Have Well-Developed Sense Organs**
   - **Annelids:** Possess simpler sensory structures.
   - **Arthropods:** Have highly developed sense organs, including complex eyes and antennae.
   - **Conclusion:** Sense organ development varies significantly. **(Incorrect)**

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks for a similarity between annelids (e.g., earthworms, leeches) and arthropods (e.g., insects, spiders, crustaceans) in terms of anatomical or physiological traits. The focus is on identifying a shared characteristic that distinguishes these phyla from others.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Annelids**: Characterized by segmented bodies, a closed circulatory system, and gas exchange via moist skin.  
- **Arthropods**: Characterized by segmented bodies, an open circulatory system (except for some crustaceans), and respiratory systems like tracheae or book lungs.  
- **Shared Traits**: Body segmentation is a key feature of both phyla, though their other systems (circulatory, respiratory) differ significantly.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (segmented bodies)**: Both annelids and arthropods exhibit body segmentation. Annelids have homonomous segmentation (repetitive segments), while arthropods have heteronomous segmentation (specialized regions like head, thorax, abdomen). This is a valid similarity.  
- **Option 2 (closed circulatory system)**: Annelids (e.g., earthworms) have a closed circulatory system, but arthropods (e.g., insects) typically have an open system. This is incorrect.  
- **Option 3 (gas exchange via moist membrane)**: Annelids use diffusion through moist skin, but arthropods rely on tracheae, book lungs, or gills. This is incorrect.  
- **Option 4 (well-developed sense organs)**: While some arthropods (e.g., insects) have advanced sense organs (compound eyes), annelids have simpler sensory structures. This is not a defining shared trait.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**  
Both annelids and arthropods exhibit **segmented bodies**, a fundamental structural similarity that underpins their classification into these phyla. Other options are inconsistent between the two groups. Segmentation is a key evolutionary adaptation for flexibility and functional specialization in both phyla.

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks for a shared characteristic between annelids (e.g., earthworms) and arthropods (e.g., insects, spiders). It requires identifying anatomical, physiological, or functional similarities between the two phyla.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Segmentation**: Both annelids and arthropods exhibit body segmentation, though the complexity and evolutionary origins differ.  
- **Circulatory Systems**: Annelids typically have a closed circulatory system (e.g., earthworms), while arthropods have an open circulatory system (e.g., insects).  
- **Gas Exchange**: Annelids rely on cutaneous respiration (diffusion through skin), while arthropods use specialized structures (e.g., tracheal systems in insects, gills in crustaceans).  
- **Sense Organs**: Arthropods generally have more complex sensory organs (e.g., compound eyes, antennae) compared to annelids.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: "Have segmented bodies"  
  - **Correct**. Both phyla exhibit segmentation. Annelids have metameric body segments (e.g., earthworm rings), and arthropods have segmented bodies (e.g., insect head/thorax/abdomen, crustacean tagmata).  
- **Option 2**: "Have a closed circulatory system"  
  - **Incorrect**. Annelids have closed systems, but arthropods have open systems where hemolymph directly bathes tissues.  
- **Option 3**: "Conduct gas exchange by diffusion through a moist membrane"  
  - **Incorrect**. While annelids use cutaneous respiration, most arthropods rely on specialized structures (tracheae, book lungs, or gills), not simple diffusion through a membrane.  
- **Option 4**: "Have well-developed sense organs"  
  - **Incorrect**. Arthropods have advanced sensory organs (e.g., compound eyes), but annelids lack comparably complex structures.  

**4. Final Selection**  
- The definitive shared feature is **segmentation**, a fundamental trait in both phyla despite differences in evolutionary adaptation.  

**My final selection is: Option 1**
