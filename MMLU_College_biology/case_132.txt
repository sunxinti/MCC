**1. Question Analysis**  
The question is asking to identify which of the provided options exemplifies Batesian mimicry. It requires an understanding of mimicry strategies in biology, specifically distinguishing Batesian mimicry from other forms of mimicry or protective strategies.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Batesian Mimicry**: This is a form of mimicry where a harmless species evolves to imitate the warning signals of a harmful or unpalatable species to deter predators. The mimic benefits by gaining protection from predators who avoid it, mistaking it for the harmful species.
- **Aposematism**: Bright coloring or other conspicuous features used by harmful species to signal toxicity or danger to predators.
- **Deimatic Behavior**: Displays or markings that startle or deter predators but do not necessarily mimic another species.
- **Crypsis (Camouflage)**: The ability of an organism to avoid observation or detection by other animals, typically by blending into the environment.

Understanding these concepts helps in differentiating between various protective and deceptive strategies employed by organisms.

**3. Analysis of Options**

1. **A type of millipede that is toxic to a toad is permanently avoided by the toad following the toad's initial attempt to consume it.**  
   - *Analysis*: This scenario describes learned avoidance by the toad after experiencing the millipede's toxicity. It illustrates predator learning and behavioral adaptation, not mimicry.
   - *Conclusion*: **Incorrect** as it does not involve mimicry.

2. **A moth exhibits false eyes at its tail end in order to disorient predators.**  
   - *Analysis*: This is an example of deimatic behavior, where the moth uses false eye spots to startle or confuse predators. It does not involve mimicking another species.
   - *Conclusion*: **Incorrect** as it pertains to deimatic behavior, not Batesian mimicry.

3. **A moth exhibits nearly identical coloration to that of a stinging bee.**  
   - *Analysis*: This is a classic example of Batesian mimicry. The harmless moth mimics the appearance of the harmful, stinging bee to deter predators who avoid the bee.
   - *Conclusion*: **Correct** as it fits the definition of Batesian mimicry.

4. **A ground-nesting gull chick displays a coloration pattern that is nearly indistinguishable from its surroundings.**  
   - *Analysis*: This describes crypsis or camouflage, where the chick blends into its environment to avoid detection. It does not involve mimicking another species.
   - *Conclusion*: **Incorrect** as it relates to camouflage, not mimicry.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks to identify an example of Batesian mimicry, a specific type of evolutionary strategy where one organism (the mimic) resembles another harmful or unpalatable organism (the model) to deceive predators. Batesian mimicry involves a harmless species mimicking a harmful species' warning signals to avoid predation.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Batesian Mimicry Definition**: A harmless species evolves to imitate the warning signals (e.g., coloration, patterns) of a harmful or unpalatable species (the model). The mimic gains protection by being mistaken for the harmful model.  
- **Key Features**:  
  1. The mimic is harmless/unpalatable.  
  2. The model is harmful/unpalatable.  
  3. Both share similar warning traits.  
- **Other Concepts to Distinguish**:  
  - **Müllerian Mimicry**: Both species are harmful and mutually reinforce their warning signals.  
  - **Aposematism**: A harmful species evolves warning signals to deter predators.  
  - **Camouflage**: Blending into the environment to avoid detection.  
  - **Defensive Mimicry**: Structural adaptations (e.g., eye spots) to startle or misdirect predators.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: A toxic millipede is avoided by a toad after an initial encounter.  
  - This describes **aposematism** (the millipede’s toxicity is real, and the predator learns to avoid it). Batesian mimicry requires a harmless mimic, so this is **incorrect**.  

- **Option 2**: A moth exhibits false eyes at its tail to disorient predators.  
  - This is **defensive mimicry** (e.g., eye spots to startle or misdirect predators). It does not involve mimicking another species’ warning signals, so it is **incorrect**.  

- **Option 3**: A moth exhibits nearly identical coloration to a stinging bee.  
  - The mimic (harmless moth) resembles the model (stinging bee). This fits **Batesian mimicry** because the moth gains protection by being mistaken for a harmful species. **Correct**.  

- **Option 4**: A gull chick’s coloration matches its surroundings.  
  - This is **camouflage**, not mimicry. The chick avoids detection by blending into the environment, not by imitating another species. **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  

**Explanation**: Batesian mimicry requires a harmless species (the mimic) to imitate the warning traits of a harmful species (the model). Option 3 describes a harmless moth mimicking the coloration of a stinging bee, which perfectly aligns with the definition. The other options describe unrelated strategies (aposematism, defensive mimicry, camouflage) or Müllerian mimicry (not applicable here).

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks for identification of Batesian mimicry, a specific evolutionary strategy where a harmless species evolves to resemble a harmful or unpalatable species to gain protection from predators.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Batesian mimicry**: A symbiotic relationship where a non-threatening mimic imitates the warning signals (e.g., coloration, shape) of a harmful model. The mimic benefits by avoiding predation, while the model’s effectiveness may decrease if predators encounter too many mimics.  
- **Distinction from other mimicry types**:  
  - **Müllerian mimicry**: Mutual resemblance between two harmful species.  
  - **Aposematism**: Direct warning signals (e.g., bright colors) in genuinely harmful species.  
  - **Crypsis**: Camouflage to blend into the environment, not mimicry of another organism.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: A toxic millipede avoided by a toad after ingestion.  
  - The millipede itself is toxic, so this exemplifies **aposematism** (warning signaling), not mimicry. Incorrect.  

- **Option 2**: Moth with false eyes to disorient predators.  
  - This is **deflective coloration** (redirecting predator attacks), not mimicry of another species. Incorrect.  

- **Option 3**: Moth resembling a stinging bee.  
  - A harmless moth (mimic) gains protection by mimicking a harmful bee (model). This is classic **Batesian mimicry**. Correct.  

- **Option 4**: Gull chick camouflaged with surroundings.  
  - This is **crypsis** (background matching), not mimicry of another organism. Incorrect.  

**4. Final Selection**  
- **Option 3** is the only example where a harmless species (moth) mimics a harmful one (bee) to deter predators, fulfilling the criteria of Batesian mimicry.  

**My final selection is: Option 3**
