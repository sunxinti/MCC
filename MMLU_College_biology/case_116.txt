**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is addressing how the brain discerns varying levels of stimulus intensity. It seeks to identify which neuronal or synaptic property changes in response to different intensities of a stimulus, thereby enabling the brain to detect these differences.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Action Potential Characteristics**: Action potentials are electrical impulses that neurons use to communicate. They follow an all-or-none principle, meaning their amplitude remains constant regardless of stimulus strength.
- **Frequency Coding**: The rate at which action potentials (spikes) occur can vary with stimulus intensity. Higher stimulus intensities typically result in a higher frequency of action potentials.
- **Threshold Potential**: This is the membrane potential that must be reached to trigger an action potential. It generally remains constant for a given neuron and does not vary with stimulus intensity.
- **Synaptic Transmission**: The number of synapses crossed can influence signal integration but is not directly related to the detection of stimulus intensity differences.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **The amplitude of the action potential**  
   - **Incorrect**. Action potential amplitude remains constant due to the all-or-none principle and does not vary with stimulus intensity.
2. **The threshold potential**  
   - **Incorrect**. The threshold potential is a fixed value for a neuron and does not change with different stimulus intensities.
3. **The number of action potentials per second**  
   - **Correct**. The frequency of action potentials increases with higher stimulus intensities, allowing the brain to detect differences in stimulus strength.
4. **The number of synapses crossed**  
   - **Incorrect**. While synapses play a role in neuronal communication, the number of synapses crossed is not directly related to encoding stimulus intensity differences.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks about the mechanism by which the brain discerns differences in stimulus intensity. This relates to the concept of **sensory transduction** and how neurons encode stimulus strength. The key is determining which physiological parameter varies with stimulus intensity to convey this information to the brain.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **All-or-None Principle**: Action potentials (APs) have a fixed amplitude once initiated; their size does not correlate with stimulus strength.  
- **Frequency Coding**: Neurons encode stimulus intensity by varying the **rate** of AP generation (more intense stimuli → higher AP frequency).  
- **Threshold Potential**: This is the membrane potential required to initiate an AP but does not change with stimulus intensity.  
- **Synaptic Transmission**: While synapses transmit signals, the number of synapses in a pathway is fixed and not modulated in real-time to encode stimulus intensity.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **The amplitude of the action potential**: Incorrect. Action potentials are "all-or-none," meaning their amplitude does not vary with stimulus intensity. Once the threshold is reached, APs fire at a fixed amplitude.  
2. **The threshold potential**: Incorrect. The threshold potential is a fixed value for a given neuron and does not change with stimulus intensity. It represents the membrane potential required to trigger an AP but is not modulated to encode stimulus strength.  
3. **The number of action potentials per second**: Correct. This is the basis of **rate coding**, where stronger stimuli elicit more frequent APs. The brain interprets the *frequency* of APs (not their amplitude) as an indicator of stimulus intensity.  
4. **The number of synapses crossed**: Incorrect. The number of synapses in a neural pathway is fixed and determined by anatomical connections, not dynamically adjusted in response to stimulus intensity.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  

The brain detects differences in stimulus intensity primarily through the **frequency of action potentials** generated by sensory neurons. Stronger stimuli trigger higher AP frequencies, while weaker stimuli produce slower firing rates. This principle, known as rate coding, is the most accurate explanation among the given options. The other choices either violate fundamental principles (e.g., the all-or-none nature of APs) or describe parameters unrelated to real-time intensity encoding.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which biological factor varies with stimulus intensity to enable the brain to detect differences in intensity. This relates to how neurons encode stimulus strength into signals the brain can interpret.  

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Action potential properties**: Action potentials are "all-or-none" events; their amplitude does not vary with stimulus intensity once the threshold is reached.  
- **Frequency coding**: The intensity of a stimulus is encoded by the *frequency* (number per second) of action potentials. Stronger stimuli trigger more frequent action potentials.  
- **Threshold potential**: A fixed voltage level required to initiate an action potential; it does not vary with stimulus intensity.  
- **Spatial summation**: Recruitment of additional neurons (more synapses) may occur for stronger stimuli, but frequency coding is the primary mechanism for intensity discrimination.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Amplitude of the action potential)**: Incorrect. Action potential amplitude is fixed due to the all-or-none principle and does not vary with stimulus strength.  
- **Option 2 (Threshold potential)**: Incorrect. Threshold potential is a stable property of neurons and does not change with stimulus intensity.  
- **Option 3 (Number of action potentials per second)**: Correct. Higher stimulus intensity increases the firing rate (frequency) of action potentials, which the brain interprets as stronger stimuli.  
- **Option 4 (Number of synapses crossed)**: Incorrect. While stronger stimuli may activate more neurons (spatial summation), this is not the primary mechanism for intensity detection in individual neurons.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The correct answer is **Option 3**, as the frequency of action potentials (number per second) directly correlates with stimulus intensity, allowing the brain to distinguish differences in strength.  

**My final selection is: Option 3**
