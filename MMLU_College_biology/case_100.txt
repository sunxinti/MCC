**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is assessing knowledge of the presence and distribution of two essential organelles, mitochondria and chloroplasts, across different kingdoms of life, specifically plants, animals, and fungi.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Mitochondria**: Organelles responsible for energy production through cellular respiration. They are found in most eukaryotic cells, including plants, animals, and fungi.
- **Chloroplasts**: Organelles responsible for photosynthesis, allowing plants and some other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy. Chloroplasts are primarily found in plant cells and some algae but are absent in animals and fungi.
- **Organism Classification**:
  - **Plants**: Possess both mitochondria and chloroplasts.
  - **Animals**: Possess mitochondria but lack chloroplasts.
  - **Fungi**: Possess mitochondria but lack chloroplasts.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Option 1**: *Plants have chloroplasts but no mitochondria; animals have mitochondria but no chloroplasts.*
   - **Incorrect**: Plants possess both chloroplasts and mitochondria.
2. **Option 2**: *Plants have chloroplasts but no mitochondria; fungi have mitochondria but no chloroplasts.*
   - **Incorrect**: Plants also have mitochondria.
3. **Option 3**: *Plants and fungi have chloroplasts but no mitochondria; animals have only mitochondria.*
   - **Incorrect**: Fungi do not have chloroplasts, and plants do have mitochondria.
4. **Option 4**: *Plants have both chloroplasts and mitochondria; animals and fungi have only mitochondria.*
   - **Correct**: Accurately reflects that plants contain both organelles, while animals and fungi contain only mitochondria.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which statement accurately describes the distribution of mitochondria and chloroplasts among plants, animals, and fungi. It requires knowledge of the presence/absence of these organelles in different eukaryotic groups.  

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Mitochondria**: Found in nearly all eukaryotic organisms (plants, animals, fungi, protists) because they are essential for cellular respiration, the primary energy production pathway.  
- **Chloroplasts**: Specialized for photosynthesis and are unique to plants, algae, and some protists. Animals and fungi lack chloroplasts since they are heterotrophic.  
- **Exceptions**: No major exceptions exist for mitochondria among the listed groups (plants, animals, fungi). Chloroplasts are restricted to photoautotrophic organisms.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Incorrect. Plants *do* have mitochondria (they require cellular respiration). The claim that animals lack chloroplasts is correct, but the first part is false.  
- **Option 2**: Incorrect. Plants have mitochondria, so the first part is false. The second part about fungi is correct, but the option’s overall accuracy is negated by the first error.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. Fungi do *not* have chloroplasts, and all eukaryotes (including fungi) have mitochondria. Both parts of this option are false.  
- **Option 4**: Correct. Plants possess both chloroplasts (for photosynthesis) and mitochondria (for respiration). Animals and fungi, being heterotrophic, lack chloroplasts but rely on mitochondria for energy.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question assesses knowledge of organelle distribution in eukaryotic organisms (plants, animals, fungi) regarding mitochondria and chloroplasts.  

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Mitochondria**: Present in almost all eukaryotic cells (plants, animals, fungi) for ATP production via cellular respiration.  
- **Chloroplasts**: Exclusive to autotrophs (e.g., plants, algae) for photosynthesis; absent in heterotrophs (animals, fungi).  
- Plants require **both mitochondria and chloroplasts**: Mitochondria are essential for energy production in non-photosynthetic tissues and during nighttime.  
- Fungi and animals lack chloroplasts as they do not perform photosynthesis.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Incorrect. Plants have both mitochondria and chloroplasts. Animals lack chloroplasts but have mitochondria.  
- **Option 2**: Incorrect. Plants possess mitochondria; fungi lack chloroplasts.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. Fungi do not have chloroplasts, and plants require mitochondria.  
- **Option 4**: Correct. Plants use chloroplasts (photosynthesis) and mitochondria (respiration). Animals and fungi, as heterotrophs, rely solely on mitochondria.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  
- Plants require mitochondria for cellular respiration in all cells (including photosynthetic ones) and chloroplasts for photosynthesis. Animals and fungi, lacking photosynthetic capability, only possess mitochondria. This aligns with fundamental eukaryotic cell biology.
