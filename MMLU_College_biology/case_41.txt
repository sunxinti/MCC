**1. Question Analysis**
- The question asks which pair of cellular components can be separated using low-speed centrifugation. This involves understanding the principles of centrifugation and the sedimentation rates of different organelles based on their size and density.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**
- **Centrifugation Principles:** Centrifugation separates cellular components based on their size, shape, and density by spinning them at high speeds. Low-speed centrifugation typically pellets larger and denser organelles, while smaller or less dense components remain in the supernatant.
- **Organelles and Sedimentation:** 
  - **Nuclei:** Large and dense, they pellet easily even at low speeds.
  - **Secretory Vesicles:** Membrane-bound and relatively large, can also pellet at low speeds.
  - **Golgi Apparatus and Endoplasmic Reticulum:** Both are membranous structures but are similar in size and density, often requiring higher speeds for separation.
  - **Lysosomes and Endosomes:** Both are vesicular structures with similar sizes and densities, making them difficult to separate via low-speed centrifugation.
  - **DNA and mRNA:** These are nucleic acids, and their separation typically relies on biochemical methods rather than centrifugation.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **DNA and mRNA**
   - Separation typically involves biochemical techniques like electrophoresis or chromatography, not low-speed centrifugation.
   - **Incorrect.**
   
2. **Nuclei and Secretory Vesicles**
   - Both are large organelles that can be pelleted at low speeds. However, due to differences in size and density, they can be effectively separated through low-speed centrifugation.
   - **Correct.**
   
3. **Golgi Apparatus and Endoplasmic Reticulum**
   - Both are extensive membranous structures with similar sedimentation rates, making them difficult to separate using low-speed centrifugation.
   - **Incorrect.**
   
4. **Lysosomes and Endosomes**
   - Both are vesicular organelles with comparable sizes and densities, making separation via low-speed centrifugation challenging.
   - **Incorrect.**

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which pair of cellular components can be separated using low-speed centrifugation. This requires understanding how centrifugation separates organelles based on size, density, and sedimentation rate. Low-speed centrifugation typically pellets larger, heavier organelles first, leaving smaller or lighter components in the supernatant.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Centrifugation Principles**: Centrifugation separates cellular components by size and density. Lower speeds (e.g., 1,000–3,000 × g) pellet large organelles like nuclei, while smaller organelles (e.g., vesicles) remain in the supernatant. Higher speeds are required for smaller components.  
- **Organelle Characteristics**:  
  - **Nuclei**: Large, dense organelles with a protective nuclear envelope.  
  - **Secretory Vesicles**: Small membrane-bound vesicles involved in transport.  
  - **Golgi Apparatus and ER**: Both membranous organelles; ER is a network of tubules/sheets, while the Golgi is a stack of flattened cisternae. Their sizes overlap.  
  - **Lysosomes and Endosomes**: Similar in size and density as small vesicles.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (DNA and mRNA)**: Both are nucleic acids. DNA is double-stranded and typically associated with proteins, while mRNA is single-stranded. However, their sizes overlap (e.g., mRNA can be very long), and they are not significantly different in density. Low-speed centrifugation would not effectively separate them.  
- **Option 2 (Nuclei and Secretory Vesicles)**: **Nuclei are large and dense**, pelleting at low speeds (e.g., 1,000 × g). **Secretory vesicles** are smaller and would remain in the supernatant. This pair can be separated by low-speed centrifugation.  
- **Option 3 (Golgi and ER)**: Both are membranous organelles with overlapping sizes. The ER is more extensive but fragments into smaller pieces during cell lysis, similar in size to Golgi cisternae. Low-speed centrifugation cannot distinguish them; higher speeds are required.  
- **Option 4 (Lysosomes and Endosomes)**: Both are small vesicles (lysosomes are ~0.1–1 µm; endosomes are similar). Their sizes and densities are too similar for low-speed centrifugation to separate them.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  

Nuclei are large and dense enough to pellet at low speeds, while secretory vesicles remain in the supernatant. This distinction aligns with standard cell fractionation protocols, where nuclei are separated first using low-speed centrifugation. The other pairs lack sufficient size/density differences to be separated by this method.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which pair of cellular components can be separated via low-speed centrifugation. This hinges on understanding how centrifugation separates particles based on size, density, and mass. Larger/denser components pellet first at low speeds, while smaller/less dense components require higher speeds.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Centrifugation principles**: Low-speed centrifugation isolates larger/heavier structures (e.g., nuclei), leaving smaller components (e.g., vesicles) in the supernatant.  
- **Organelle size/density**:  
  - Nuclei (~5–10 µm) are significantly larger than secretory vesicles (~0.1–1 µm).  
  - Golgi and ER fragments are similar in size and require higher speeds.  
  - Lysosomes and endosomes are comparable in size/density, needing high-speed separation.  
  - DNA and mRNA (free in solution) are not separated by centrifugation alone.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (DNA and mRNA)**: Both are soluble nucleic acids; centrifugation alone cannot separate them. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 2 (Nuclei and secretory vesicles)**: Nuclei pellet at low speeds, while secretory vesicles remain suspended. **Correct**.  
- **Option 3 (Golgi and ER)**: Both form smaller vesicles upon cell lysis, requiring higher speeds. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 4 (Lysosomes and endosomes)**: Similar size/density; high-speed centrifugation is needed. **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  
Nuclei are large and dense, pelleting at low-speed centrifugation, whereas secretory vesicles are small and remain in the supernatant. This distinction makes Option 2 the only viable answer.
