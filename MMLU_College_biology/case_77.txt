**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is inquiring about the specific type of tropism exhibited by a plant that grows along a trellis. Tropism refers to the directional growth response of plants to external stimuli. Identifying the correct type of tropism requires understanding how plants interact with their environment to support growth patterns.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Tropism**: Plant growth responses directed towards or away from environmental stimuli.
- **Thigmotropism**: A directional growth response to touch or physical contact. Common in climbing plants that wrap around structures for support.
- **Phototropism**: Growth response to light, where plants grow towards light sources to maximize photosynthesis.
- **Gravitropism (likely referred to as gravidotropism)**: Growth response to gravity, helping plants orient their roots downward and stems upward.
- **Negative Gravitropism**: Growth in the opposite direction of gravitational pull, often seen in stems growing upwards.

Understanding these definitions helps in identifying that a plant growing along a trellis is responding to touch or physical support structures.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Thigmotropism**  
   - **Correct**. Thigmotropism is the growth response of plants to physical contact or touch. Climbing plants grow along trellises by sensing and responding to the support structure, making this the appropriate term.
2. **Phototropism**  
   - **Incorrect**. Phototropism involves growth in response to light direction. While it is relevant to overall plant growth, it does not specifically describe the plant's interaction with a trellis.
3. **Gravidotropism**  
   - **Incorrect**. The term "gravidotropism" is not commonly recognized in botanical sciences. It is likely a misrepresentation of "gravitropism," which relates to growth in response to gravity, not to physical supports like a trellis.
4. **Negative Gravidotropism**  
   - **Incorrect**. Assuming it refers to "negative gravitropism," this describes growth opposite to gravity, such as stems growing upwards. However, it does not pertain to the plant's interaction with a trellis structure.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which tropism a plant exhibits when growing along a trellis. Tropisms are directional growth responses in plants caused by environmental stimuli. The key here is identifying the stimulus associated with a trellis, which provides physical contact and structural support.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Thigmotropism**: Growth response to touch. Examples include tendrils coiling around a support or stems growing along a structure.  
- **Phototropism**: Growth response to light direction (e.g., stems bending toward light).  
- **Gravitropism**: Growth response to gravity (positive = downward, negative = upward).  
- **Negative Gravitropism**: Growth against gravity, typically seen in shoots growing upward.  

The question focuses on a plant interacting physically with a trellis, making touch (thigmotropism) the most relevant stimulus. Light and gravity are less directly tied to the trellis itself.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Thigmotropism)**: Correct. The plant’s growth along the trellis is a direct response to physical contact, which defines thigmotropism.  
- **Option 2 (Phototropism)**: Incorrect. Phototropism involves directional light, not physical contact with a structure like a trellis.  
- **Option 3 (Gravidotropism)**: Incorrect. Gravitropism refers to growth in response to gravity, not structural contact.  
- **Option 4 (Negative Gravidotropism)**: Incorrect. While shoots exhibit negative gravitropism (growing upward), this does not explain the interaction with the trellis.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**  
Thigmotropism is the correct answer because the plant’s growth along the trellis is directly caused by physical contact with the structure, which is the definition of this tropism. The other options describe responses to light or gravity, which are unrelated to the trellis’s role as a physical support.

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks to identify the type of tropism exhibited by a plant growing along a trellis. Tropism refers to directional growth in response to an external stimulus. The key is to determine which stimulus (touch, light, gravity) drives the plant's growth along the trellis.  

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Thigmotropism**: Growth response to physical touch or mechanical contact (e.g., vines coiling around a support).  
- **Phototropism**: Growth toward or away from light (e.g., stems bending toward a light source).  
- **Gravitropism**: Growth response to gravity. Positive gravitropism (roots growing downward) and negative gravitropism (stems growing upward).  
- The term "gravidotropism" is non-standard; the correct term is gravitropism. The options likely intend "gravitropism" but include a typo.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Thigmotropism)**: Correct. A trellis provides physical contact, and plants like vines exhibit thigmotropism by wrapping around or growing along surfaces they touch.  
- **Option 2 (Phototropism)**: Incorrect. The scenario does not mention light as the stimulus; the growth is tied to contact with the trellis, not light direction.  
- **Option 3 (Gravidotropism)**: Incorrect. "Gravidotropism" is not a recognized term. If interpreted as gravitropism, it would not apply here, as the plant’s growth along the trellis is not primarily gravity-dependent.  
- **Option 4 (Negative gravidotropism)**: Incorrect. Even if interpreted as negative gravitropism (upward growth against gravity), this does not explain directional growth along a trellis, which is contact-driven.  

**4. Final Selection**  
- The plant’s growth along the trellis is a direct response to tactile stimuli, making **thigmotropism** the correct answer.  

**My final selection is: Option 1**
