**1. Question Analysis**
- The question is asking for a characteristic that is exclusively found in angiosperms (flowering plants) and not present in other plant groups. It requires distinguishing features that set angiosperms apart from other plant classifications.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**
- **Angiosperms** are a group of plants known for having flowers and seeds enclosed within a fruit. They exhibit several unique biological processes and structures.
- **Double fertilization** is a distinctive process in angiosperms where one sperm fertilizes the egg cell to form a zygote, and the other sperm fuses with two polar nuclei to form the endosperm, which nourishes the developing embryo. This process is not found in other plant groups.
- Other plant groups, such as gymnosperms, also have a dominant sporophyte life cycle and alternation of generations, but they do not undergo double fertilization. Additionally, wind-borne pollen is common in gymnosperms and some angiosperms but is not unique to angiosperms.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Wind-borne pollen**
   - **Incorrect.** Wind-borne pollen is a reproductive strategy found in both gymnosperms and some angiosperms. It is not exclusive to angiosperms.
2. **A dominant sporophyte life cycle**
   - **Incorrect.** A dominant sporophyte generation is a characteristic of all land plants, including mosses, ferns, gymnosperms, and angiosperms. It is not unique to angiosperms.
3. **Alteration of generations**
   - **Incorrect.** Alternation of generations is a fundamental life cycle pattern in all plants, including non-angiosperms. It is not specific to angiosperms.
4. **Double fertilization**
   - **Correct.** Double fertilization is a unique feature of angiosperms, distinguishing them from other plant groups. It involves the fusion of one sperm with the egg and another sperm with the central cell, leading to the formation of both the zygote and endosperm.

**4. Final Selection**
- **My final selection is: Option 4**  
Double fertilization is a characteristic unique to angiosperms, making Option 4 the most accurate answer.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks for a characteristic unique to angiosperms (flowering plants). The options include reproductive and life cycle traits, requiring an understanding of plant diversity and angiosperm-specific features.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Angiosperm Characteristics**: Angiosperms are defined by their flowers, seeds enclosed in ovaries (forming fruits), and unique reproductive processes like double fertilization.  
- **Sporophyte Dominance**: All vascular plants (including gymnosperms, ferns, and angiosperms) have a dominant sporophyte phase in their life cycle.  
- **Alternation of Generations**: All plants, including bryophytes, ferns, gymnosperms, and angiosperms, exhibit this alternation between haploid gametophyte and diploid sporophyte stages.  
- **Double Fertilization**: A process unique to angiosperms where two sperm cells fertilize the egg (forming the embryo) and the polar nuclei (forming the endosperm).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Wind-borne pollen)**: Incorrect. Many plants, including gymnosperms (e.g., conifers) and some angiosperms, use wind pollination. This is not unique to angiosperms.  
- **Option 2 (Dominant sporophyte life cycle)**: Incorrect. All vascular plants (ferns, gymnosperms, angiosperms) have a dominant sporophyte. This is not unique to angiosperms.  
- **Option 3 (Alteration of generations)**: Incorrect. All plants, including non-angiosperms, undergo alternation of generations.  
- **Option 4 (Double fertilization)**: Correct. This process occurs only in angiosperms and is absent in all other plant groups.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks for a characteristic exclusive to angiosperms (flowering plants). It requires distinguishing angiosperm-specific traits from those shared with other plant groups (e.g., gymnosperms, ferns, mosses).  

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Angiosperm uniqueness**: Traits like flowers, fruits, and double fertilization distinguish them.  
- **Comparative biology**: Contrasting angiosperms with gymnosperms (e.g., fertilization mechanisms, life cycles) and other plant groups is critical.  
- **Double fertilization**: A process where one sperm fertilizes the egg (forming a zygote) and another fuses with two polar nuclei (forming triploid endosperm). This is absent in non-angiosperms.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Wind-borne pollen**  
  Incorrect. Wind pollination occurs in gymnosperms (e.g., conifers) and some angiosperms (e.g., grasses). Not unique.  
- **Option 2: A dominant sporophyte life cycle**  
  Incorrect. Vascular plants (ferns, gymnosperms, angiosperms) all have dominant sporophytes. Common trait, not unique.  
- **Option 3: Alteration of generations**  
  Incorrect. All plants exhibit alternation of generations (sporophyte and gametophyte phases). Universal plant feature.  
- **Option 4: Double fertilization**  
  Correct. Exclusive to angiosperms. Gymnosperms undergo single fertilization; the second sperm fusion to form triploid endosperm is absent in other groups.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  
Double fertilization is a defining feature of angiosperms, absent in all other plant lineages. While other options describe traits shared with gymnosperms or broader plant groups, double fertilization is unique to flowering plants.
