问题: 
In Sweden, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) severely limits populations of its prey, including hares. However, red fox populations are sometimes attacked by a fatal parasite, the mange mite. As mite population sizes increase at a given site, how are hare and fox populations most likely to respond at the same site? (Assume that hares have no major predators at this site other than foxes.)
选项: 
1. Both fox and hare populations will decrease.
2. Both fox and hare populations will increase.
3. Fox populations will decrease and hare populations will increase.
4. Fox populations will increase and hare populations will decrease.

**1. Question Analysis**
- The question examines the interaction between predator (red fox) and prey (hares) populations in the context of an additional factor: the presence of a fatal parasite (mange mite) affecting the predator. It seeks to understand the combined effect of parasite pressure on foxes and the resulting impact on hare populations, assuming hares have no other major predators.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**
- **Predator-Prey Dynamics:** Typically, if a predator population decreases, the prey population may increase due to reduced predation pressure.
- **Parasitic Impact:** The mange mite negatively affects red fox populations by increasing mortality or decreasing their health and reproductive success.
- **Ecological Balance:** In ecosystems, changes affecting one species often have cascading effects on others. Here, a decline in foxes could lead to an increase in hare populations.
- **Population Regulation:** Natural checks like disease (mange mite) can regulate predator populations, indirectly influencing prey populations.

**3. Analysis of Options**

1. **Both fox and hare populations will decrease.**
   - **Incorrect.** While fox populations may decrease due to the parasite, hare populations are likely to increase as a result of reduced predation.

2. **Both fox and hare populations will increase.**
   - **Incorrect.** This scenario is unlikely as the parasite negatively impacts foxes, making simultaneous increases in both populations improbable.

3. **Fox populations will decrease and hare populations will increase.**
   - **Correct.** The parasite reduces fox numbers, leading to decreased predation on hares, allowing hare populations to grow.

4. **Fox populations will increase and hare populations will decrease.**
   - **Incorrect.** This is contrary to the expected outcome since the parasite would reduce fox populations, not increase them.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question examines the interplay between predator-prey dynamics and the impact of a parasitic pathogen on population sizes. Specifically, it asks how increasing populations of a fatal parasite (mange mites) in red foxes will affect both fox and hare populations, given that foxes are the primary predators of hares.  

---

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Predator-Prey Relationships**: Foxes (predators) regulate hare (prey) populations through predation. If fox populations decline, predation pressure on hares decreases, leading to an increase in hare populations.  
- **Parasite Impact on Host Populations**: The mange mite is described as fatal to foxes, so an increase in mite populations will directly reduce fox survival and reproduction, thereby decreasing fox population size.  
- **Trophic Cascades**: Changes in predator populations (e.g., foxes) can trigger cascading effects on prey (hares) and other ecosystem components. Here, reduced fox predation should relieve top-down pressure on hares.  
- **Absence of Alternative Predators**: The question specifies that hares have no major predators besides foxes, eliminating confounding factors like other predators compensating for fox declines.  

---

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Both decrease):** Incorrect. If fox populations decline due to mites, hare populations should *increase* because predation pressure is reduced. Both populations decreasing would require an external factor harming hares, which is not stated.  
- **Option 2 (Both increase):** Incorrect. Fox populations are directly harmed by mites, so their numbers will decrease. Hares might increase due to reduced predation, but foxes cannot increase if mites are fatal.  
- **Option 3 (Foxes decrease, hares increase):** Correct. Mites reduce fox populations, leading to decreased predation on hares and allowing hare populations to grow.  
- **Option 4 (Foxes increase, hares decrease):** Incorrect. Mites are fatal to foxes, so their population cannot increase. The inverse relationship between fox and hare populations is also reversed here.  

---

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  

The mange mite’s fatal impact on foxes reduces their population. With fewer foxes preying on hares (their only major predator), hare populations will increase due to reduced predation pressure. This aligns with fundamental predator-prey dynamics and trophic cascade principles.

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question examines predator-prey dynamics and the indirect effects of a parasitic infection on trophic interactions. Specifically, it asks how increasing mange mite populations (which kill foxes) will impact fox (predator) and hare (prey) populations.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Predator-prey relationships**: Foxes suppress hare populations through predation. Reduced fox numbers typically relieve predation pressure, allowing hare populations to rise.  
- **Parasite-host dynamics**: Mange mites act as a density-dependent limiting factor on foxes. Increased mite populations would increase fox mortality, reducing fox numbers.  
- **Trophic cascade**: A decline in fox populations (due to mites) should indirectly benefit hares by reducing predation, assuming no other predators are present (as stated in the question).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1** (Both populations decrease): Incorrect. Reduced fox numbers would alleviate predation on hares, leading to hare population growth, not decline.  
- **Option 2** (Both populations increase): Incorrect. Increasing mite populations would harm foxes, causing their decline. Foxes cannot increase under heightened parasitic pressure.  
- **Option 3** (Foxes decrease, hares increase): Correct. Mite-induced fox mortality reduces predation on hares, allowing hare populations to rebound.  
- **Option 4** (Foxes increase, hares decrease): Incorrect. Increased mite populations would suppress foxes, contradicting the premise of the question.  

**4. Final Selection**  
- The parasite-driven decline in foxes directly reduces predation pressure on hares, enabling hare populations to grow. This aligns with classic trophic cascade principles.  

**My final selection is: Option 3**
