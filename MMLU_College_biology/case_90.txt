问题: 
Hybrids between some related species of plants are sterile because the parent plants had different chromosome numbers. Occasionally the chromosome number of such a hybrid plant doubles spontaneously. Which of the following best describes the descendants of those plants with the double chromosome number?
选项: 
1. The plant with the double chromosome number would be genetically defective and have no descendants.
2. The descendants would be at a selective advantage because of the increased ability to introgress.
3. The descendants would be reproductively successful because they could backcross with the parental species.
4. The descendants would regain the ability to reproduce sexually because chromosomes could pair normally.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question addresses why hybrids between related plant species are often sterile due to differing chromosome numbers in parent plants. It further explores the scenario where a hybrid plant undergoes spontaneous chromosome doubling and asks about the reproductive viability of its descendants.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Hybrid Sterility:** Hybrid plants may be sterile if the parent species have different chromosome numbers, leading to problems during meiosis where chromosomes fail to pair correctly.
- **Chromosome Doubling (Polyploidy):** Doubling the chromosome number in a hybrid can restore balanced chromosome pairing during meiosis, potentially restoring fertility.
- **Reproductive Success:** If chromosome pairing is normalized, the plant can undergo regular sexual reproduction, producing viable gametes.
- **Backcrossing Potential:** A fertile hybrid with doubled chromosomes may be able to cross back with parent species, facilitating gene flow and introgression.
- **Genetic Defects:** While chromosomal abnormalities can cause defects, chromosome doubling in sterile hybrids often resolves pairing issues rather than introducing defects.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Incorrect.** Chromosome doubling often restores fertility rather than causing genetic defects leading to no descendants.
2. **Partially Correct but Not the Best Choice.** While increased chromosome numbers can facilitate introgression, the primary effect is the restoration of fertility.
3. **Incorrect.** Backcrossing is a potential outcome, but the key reason for reproductive success is the restoration of normal meiosis, not specifically the ability to backcross.
4. **Correct.** Doubling the chromosome number can allow chromosomes to pair normally during meiosis, restoring the ability to reproduce sexually.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question examines the consequences of polyploidy in hybrid plants with mismatched parental chromosome numbers. Hybrids between species with different chromosome counts often face meiotic failure due to unpaired chromosomes, leading to sterility. The question asks what happens when such a hybrid undergoes spontaneous chromosome doubling and how its descendants fare reproductively.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Hybrid Sterility**: Hybrids with mismatched chromosome numbers (e.g., triploid offspring of diploid parents with different base numbers) cannot pair chromosomes properly during meiosis, resulting in non-viable gametes.  
- **Polyploidy**: Spontaneous doubling of chromosomes (e.g., from 3n to 6n or 2n to 4n) can restore fertility. In tetraploid hybrids, chromosomes can pair homologously within duplicated sets, enabling normal meiosis.  
- **Meiotic Pairing**: Proper pairing requires homologous chromosomes. Doubling the chromosome number creates homologous sets, allowing chromosomes to pair and form viable gametes.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Incorrect. Chromosome doubling restores fertility, so the plant can produce descendants.  
- **Option 2**: Incorrect. Introgression (gene flow between species) requires backcrossing with parental species, but polyploid hybrids are often reproductively isolated from their diploid parents. The question does not address selective advantage.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. Backcrossing between tetraploid hybrids and diploid parents would produce sterile triploid offspring, not viable descendants.  
- **Option 4**: Correct. Doubling the chromosome number allows homologous pairing during meiosis, enabling normal sexual reproduction and viable offspring.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  
The doubled chromosome number resolves the pairing issue during meiosis, allowing chromosomes to pair normally and produce viable gametes. This restores sexual reproduction in the descendants, making Option 4 the most accurate answer.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question addresses hybrid sterility in plants due to differing parental chromosome numbers and explores the outcome when chromosome doubling occurs. It requires understanding of hybrid infertility mechanisms, polyploidy, and restoration of fertility.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- Hybrid sterility often arises from mismatched chromosome numbers (e.g., odd ploidy levels like triploids), preventing homologous pairing during meiosis.  
- Chromosome doubling (polyploidization) converts hybrids to even ploidy (e.g., tetraploid, hexaploid), restoring homologous pairing and enabling normal meiosis.  
- Sexual reproduction viability depends on homologous chromosome pairing during gamete formation. Polyploid hybrids with even chromosome numbers can form viable gametes and reproduce sexually.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Incorrect. Doubling chromosomes resolves pairing issues, making the plant fertile. Such polyploids (e.g., tetraploids) are common in plants and can produce descendants.  
- **Option 2**: Incorrect. Introgress (gene flow between species via backcrossing) is irrelevant here. The doubled hybrid forms a reproductively isolated lineage, not relying on parental species.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. Backcrossing with parental species is unlikely. A tetraploid hybrid (4n) crossed with diploid parents (2n) would produce sterile triploids (3n), limiting reproductive success.  
- **Option 4**: Correct. Chromosome doubling provides homologous pairs, enabling normal meiosis. This restores fertility, allowing sexual reproduction without reliance on parental species.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  
Chromosome doubling resolves hybrid sterility by restoring homologous pairing during meiosis. This enables viable gamete formation and sexual reproduction in descendants, making Option 4 the most accurate.
