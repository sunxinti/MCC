**1. Question Analysis**
- The question asks for a comparison between air and water, specifically identifying which statement correctly describes a characteristic of air relative to water. This involves understanding the physical and chemical properties of both mediums and how they influence biological processes.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**
- **Physical Support:** In biological contexts, physical support refers to the medium's ability to sustain or resist the movement and structure of organisms.
- **Oxygen Concentration:** Oxygen levels are critical for respiration in organisms, and the solubility of oxygen differs between air and water.
- **Resistance to Motion:** This relates to the viscosity and density of the medium, affecting how organisms move within it.
- **Thermal Inertia:** This is the medium's capacity to store and retain heat, influencing temperature stability in biological environments.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Air provides more physical support.**
   - *Incorrect.* Water is denser and provides greater physical support to organisms, helping maintain structural integrity. Air, being less dense, offers less physical support.
   
2. **Air has a higher O₂ concentration.**
   - *Correct.* Atmospheric air contains approximately 21% oxygen, whereas dissolved oxygen in water is much lower, depending on temperature and other factors. This higher concentration in air is significant for aerobic respiration in terrestrial organisms.
   
3. **Air offers more resistance to motion.**
   - *Incorrect.* Water is more viscous and offers greater resistance to movement. Air, being less viscous, provides less resistance, allowing for easier movement.
   
4. **Air has more thermal inertia.**
   - *Incorrect.* Water has a higher thermal inertia compared to air, meaning it can absorb and retain more heat. Air, with lower thermal inertia, heats up and cools down more quickly.

**4. Final Selection**
- **My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question compares air and water based on four properties: physical support, O₂ concentration, resistance to motion, and thermal inertia. It requires understanding the physical and chemical differences between air and water relevant to biological systems.  

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Physical Support**: Water’s higher density and buoyancy provide more structural support to organisms compared to air.  
- **O₂ Concentration**: While both contain oxygen, air has a much higher concentration (21% by volume), whereas dissolved oxygen in water is significantly lower (typically 6-8 mg/L).  
- **Resistance to Motion**: Water’s higher viscosity creates greater resistance to movement than air.  
- **Thermal Inertia**: Water has a higher specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity, allowing it to retain heat longer and resist temperature changes better than air.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Incorrect. Water provides more physical support due to its density and buoyancy, which help organisms maintain structure and reduce gravitational stress.  
- **Option 2**: Correct. Air has a much higher O₂ concentration (21%) compared to dissolved O₂ in water (~6-8 mg/L). Organisms in water require specialized structures (e.g., gills) to extract oxygen efficiently.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. Water offers greater resistance to motion due to its higher viscosity. Moving through air requires less energy than moving through water.  
- **Option 4**: Incorrect. Water has higher thermal inertia, meaning it resists temperature fluctuations better than air. Air’s low thermal inertia causes rapid temperature changes.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  
Air has a significantly higher oxygen concentration than water, making this the only true statement. Water’s dissolved oxygen levels are far lower, necessitating adaptations for aquatic organisms to extract oxygen efficiently. The other options contradict fundamental properties of air and water.

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question compares the physical and chemical properties of air and water in a biological context, focusing on how these differences impact organisms. Key aspects include buoyancy/support, gas concentration, resistance to motion, and thermal properties.  

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Buoyancy**: Water is denser than air, providing greater physical support to organisms.  
- **O₂ Concentration**: Air has ~21% O₂ by volume, while water holds dissolved O₂ at much lower concentrations (e.g., ~0.001% in freshwater).  
- **Resistance to Motion**: Water is more viscous than air, creating greater drag.  
- **Thermal Inertia**: Water has a higher specific heat capacity than air, meaning it resists temperature changes more effectively.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Air provides more physical support)**: **Incorrect**. Water’s higher density provides buoyancy, reducing the need for structural support in aquatic organisms (e.g., marine vs. terrestrial animals).  
- **Option 2 (Air has a higher O₂ concentration)**: **Correct**. Atmospheric O₂ is far more concentrated (~21%) compared to dissolved O₂ in water (e.g., ~8 mg/L in freshwater at 20°C, equivalent to ~0.001% by volume).  
- **Option 3 (Air offers more resistance to motion)**: **Incorrect**. Water’s viscosity creates higher resistance; terrestrial organisms expend less energy overcoming drag compared to aquatic ones.  
- **Option 4 (Air has more thermal inertia)**: **Incorrect**. Water’s high specific heat capacity gives it greater thermal inertia, stabilizing temperatures in aquatic environments.  

**4. Final Selection**  
- **Option 2** is the only statement supported by biological principles. Air’s higher O₂ concentration directly impacts gas exchange efficiency, driving evolutionary adaptations like lungs in terrestrial organisms.  

**My final selection is: Option 2**
