**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question seeks to determine the proportion of the human genome that is responsible for encoding proteins. Specifically, it asks for an approximate fraction representing the percentage of the entire genome that translates into protein-coding sequences.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- The human genome comprises both coding and non-coding regions. Coding regions, known as exons, are transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) and then translated into proteins, which perform various functions in the body.
- Non-coding regions include introns within genes and vast stretches of DNA between genes (intergenic regions). These areas were once considered "junk DNA," but research has revealed they play roles in gene regulation, structural organization of chromosomes, and other cellular processes.
- Comparative genomic studies have estimated that only a small percentage of the human genome consists of protein-coding genes, while the majority serves regulatory and structural functions or remains untranslated.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1. 2%**  
  - This option aligns closely with current scientific estimates. Approximately 1-2% of the human genome consists of protein-coding genes. This small fraction is responsible for encoding the roughly 20,000-25,000 proteins in the human body.
- **Option 2. 25%**  
  - This significantly overestimates the protein-coding portion of the genome. While there are regulatory elements and non-coding RNAs within this percentage, only about 2% directly encode proteins.
- **Option 3. 50%**  
  - This is an inaccurate representation. Half of the genome is non-coding, serving various other functions, but only a small fraction is dedicated to protein coding.
- **Option 4. 90%**  
  - This option vastly overstates the non-coding portion of the genome. While non-coding DNA is substantial, it does not constitute 90% of the genome designated for protein encoding.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks for the approximate fraction of the human genome that encodes proteins. This requires knowledge of genome composition, specifically distinguishing between protein-coding regions (exons) and non-coding regions (introns, regulatory elements, repetitive sequences, etc.).

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- The human genome consists of approximately 3 billion base pairs.  
- Protein-coding regions correspond to the exons within genes, which are the portions transcribed into mRNA and subsequently translated into proteins.  
- The Human Genome Project (2003) revealed that only ~1.5-2% of the genome directly encodes proteins.  
- The remaining ~98% includes non-coding RNAs (e.g., rRNA, tRNA, miRNA), regulatory sequences, introns, and repetitive elements (e.g., transposons).  
- It is critical to note that the question specifically refers to *protein-encoding* regions, excluding non-coding RNAs and other non-protein-coding DNA.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (2%):** Correct. Matches the established finding that ~1.5-2% of the genome encodes proteins.  
- **Option 2 (25%):** Incorrect. This overestimates the protein-coding fraction by an order of magnitude. Such a value might mistakenly include non-coding RNAs or misinterpret gene count (20,000-25,000 genes) as a percentage of the genome.  
- **Option 3 (50%):** Incorrect. This would imply half the genome codes for proteins, which contradicts all genomic data.  
- **Option 4 (90%):** Incorrect. This is the inverse of reality, as most of the genome is non-coding.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks for the approximate fraction of the human genome that directly encodes proteins. This requires understanding the distinction between coding and non-coding DNA, as well as the proportion of the genome dedicated to protein synthesis.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- The human genome comprises ~3 billion base pairs.  
- Protein-coding regions (exons) are transcribed into mRNA and translated into proteins.  
- Non-coding DNA includes introns (spliced out during mRNA processing), regulatory sequences, repetitive elements (e.g., transposons), and pseudogenes.  
- Historically, only ~1-2% of the genome is estimated to encode proteins, based on exon sequences. This accounts for <20,000 protein-coding genes.  
- The ENCODE project identified biochemical activity in ~80% of the genome, but "functional" regions (e.g., regulatory elements) are distinct from protein-coding regions.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (2%)**: Correct. Exons (protein-coding sequences) constitute ~1-2% of the genome. Even including untranslated regions (UTRs) in exons, this remains the widely accepted estimate.  
- **Option 2 (25%)**: Incorrect. This far exceeds the coding fraction. Non-coding functional elements (e.g., regulatory regions) may occupy ~10-15%, but not protein-coding regions.  
- **Option 3 (50%)**: Incorrect. Overestimates coding capacity by ~25x. Repetitive elements and other non-coding DNA dominate the genome.  
- **Option 4 (90%)**: Incorrect. This would imply nearly the entire genome is coding, which contradicts established genomic studies.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The correct answer aligns with the consensus that protein-coding exons represent ~2% of the human genome. Non-coding DNA dominates, with regulatory and structural roles.  

**My final selection is: Option 1**
