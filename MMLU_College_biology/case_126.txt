**1. Question Analysis**  
The question pertains to the process of double fertilization in flowering plants. It specifically asks about the outcome of the second sperm cell uniting with the polar nuclei, following the initial fertilization event where a sperm cell fuses with the egg to form a zygote.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
Double fertilization is a distinctive feature of angiosperms (flowering plants). In this process:
- The first sperm cell fertilizes the egg cell, resulting in the formation of a diploid zygote, which will develop into the embryo.
- The second sperm cell fuses with the two polar nuclei located in the central cell of the embryo sac. This fusion leads to the creation of a triploid cell, which develops into the endosperm, a nutrient-rich tissue that supports embryo development.

Understanding the roles of the zygote and endosperm is crucial, as well as recognizing that the other options listed do not directly relate to the products of double fertilization.

**3. Analysis of Options**

1. **Megagametophyte**  
   - *Incorrect.* The megagametophyte, also known as the embryo sac, is the female gametophyte in flowering plants where fertilization occurs. It is not a product of fertilization.

2. **Endodermis**  
   - *Incorrect.* The endodermis is a layer of cells in plant roots that regulates the flow of substances into the vascular system. It is unrelated to the process of fertilization or double fertilization.

3. **Embryo**  
   - *Partially Correct.* The embryo is indeed formed from the zygote resulting from the first fertilization event. However, the question specifically asks about the product of the second fertilization event involving the polar nuclei.

4. **Endosperm**  
   - *Correct.* The endosperm is formed from the fusion of the second sperm cell with the polar nuclei during double fertilization. It serves as a nutrient source for the developing embryo.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question focuses on the outcome of the second sperm's fusion during double fertilization in flowering plants. It requires knowledge of plant reproduction, specifically the process of double fertilization and the structures involved.  

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Double Fertilization**: A unique process in angiosperms where two sperm cells from a pollen grain fuse with two cells in the ovule.  
  - The first sperm fuses with the egg cell to form a **zygote** (diploid, 2n), which develops into the **embryo**.  
  - The second sperm fuses with the **polar nuclei** (two nuclei within the central cell of the megagametophyte) to form a **triploid endosperm** (3n), which serves as a nutrient storage tissue for the developing embryo.  
- **Megagametophyte**: The female gametophyte (7 cells, 4 nuclei) within the ovule, including the egg and central cell. It is the site of fertilization but not the direct product of the second sperm's fusion.  
- **Endosperm**: A nutritive tissue formed by the fusion of the second sperm and the polar nuclei, critical for embryo development.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Megagametophyte**  
  - Incorrect. The megagametophyte is the structure within the ovule that contains the egg and polar nuclei. It is not formed by the second sperm's fusion but is the location where fertilization occurs.  

- **Option 2: Endodermis**  
  - Incorrect. The endodermis is a layer of cells in roots and stems that regulates water flow. It is unrelated to double fertilization or its products.  

- **Option 3: Embryo**  
  - Incorrect. The embryo develops from the zygote formed by the first sperm and the egg. This option refers to the product of the *first* sperm, not the second.  

- **Option 4: Endosperm**  
  - Correct. The second sperm fuses with two polar nuclei (from the central cell of the megagametophyte) to form the triploid endosperm, which nourishes the embryo.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question focuses on the outcome of the second fertilization event in double fertilization, a process unique to flowering plants. Specifically, it asks which structure is formed when the second sperm fuses with the polar nuclei.  

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Double fertilization** involves two sperm cells:  
  1. One sperm fertilizes the **egg cell** (haploid), forming a diploid **zygote** (future embryo).  
  2. The second sperm fuses with the **two polar nuclei** (typically haploid each) in the central cell of the female gametophyte, resulting in a triploid (3n) cell.  
- The triploid cell divides to form the **endosperm**, a nutrient-rich tissue that nourishes the developing embryo.  
- **Megagametophyte**: The female gametophyte (embryo sac) itself, which houses the egg and polar nuclei. It is not a product of fertilization.  
- **Endodermis**: A root tissue layer involved in selective nutrient transport; unrelated to fertilization.  
- **Embryo**: Derived from the zygote (first fertilization event), not the second.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (megagametophyte)**: Incorrect. The megagametophyte is the pre-existing structure (embryo sac) that contains the egg and polar nuclei. It is not formed during fertilization.  
- **Option 2 (endodermis)**: Incorrect. The endodermis is a root tissue unrelated to reproductive processes.  
- **Option 3 (embryo)**: Incorrect. The embryo originates from the zygote (first sperm-egg fusion), not the second fertilization event.  
- **Option 4 (endosperm)**: Correct. The second sperm’s fusion with the polar nuclei produces the triploid endosperm, which supports embryonic growth.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  
The second fertilization event in angiosperms specifically generates the endosperm, a critical tissue for embryonic nutrition. This aligns with the biological definition of double fertilization and the roles of the involved structures.
