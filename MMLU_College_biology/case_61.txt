**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is asking to identify which of the provided biological facts was known and established before the year 1859, the publication year of Charles Darwin's *On the Origin of Species*. This involves understanding historical developments in biological sciences up to that time.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **DNA and Heredity:** The role of DNA as the genetic material was discovered in the 20th century, well after 1859.
- **Mendelian Principles:** Gregor Mendel's work on genetics was published in 1866, which is after 1859.
- **Prokaryotes Classification:** The division of life into Bacteria and Archaea domains is a relatively recent development in microbiology, established in the late 20th century.
- **Fossilized Extinct Species:** The existence of extinct species evidenced by fossils was recognized before Darwin's time, with paleontology already an established field.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Incorrect.** The understanding of DNA as the basis of heredity was not established until the 20th century.
2. **Incorrect.** Mendelian genetics was formulated after 1859.
3. **Incorrect.** The classification of prokaryotes into Bacteria and Archaea was developed in the late 20th century.
4. **Correct.** Fossil evidence of extinct species was known and studied before 1859.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which biological fact was known before 1859, the year Darwin published *On the Origin of Species*. This requires assessing the historical timelines of key biological discoveries.  

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **DNA as the hereditary basis (Option 1):** Discovered in the late 19th century but its role in heredity was not established until the mid-20th century (e.g., Avery’s 1944 experiments).  
- **Mendelian principles (Option 2):** Gregor Mendel published his work in 1865, *after* 1859, and it was not widely recognized until the early 1900s.  
- **Prokaryotic domains (Option 3):** The three-domain system (Bacteria, Archaea, Eukarya) was proposed by Carl Woese in 1977, based on molecular evidence.  
- **Fossilized extinct species (Option 4):** Fossils of extinct organisms (e.g., dinosaurs, prehistoric mammals) were well-documented by the early 19th century. Georges Cuvier established the concept of extinction in the early 1800s.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1:** Incorrect. The chemical nature and role of DNA in heredity were unknown before the 20th century.  
- **Option 2:** Incorrect. Mendel’s work postdates 1859, and Mendelian genetics was not recognized until later.  
- **Option 3:** Incorrect. The classification of prokaryotes into Bacteria and Archaea occurred long after 1859.  
- **Option 4:** Correct. Fossils of extinct species were widely accepted as evidence of past life by the 1800s, predating Darwin’s publication.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  

Fossilized remains of extinct species were a well-established concept by the early 19th century, decades before Darwin’s *Origin of Species*. This knowledge was foundational to discussions of natural history and evolution, including Darwin’s own work. The other options all postdate 1859 by significant margins.

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks which biological fact was established before 1859, the year Darwin published *On the Origin of Species*. This requires evaluating the historical timeline of scientific discoveries related to heredity, genetics, taxonomy, and paleontology.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Option 1**: DNA's role in heredity was discovered in the 20th century (Avery, 1944; Watson and Crick, 1953).  
- **Option 2**: Mendel's work on inheritance (1865) was published post-1859 and remained obscure until the early 1900s.  
- **Option 3**: Archaea were recognized as a distinct domain in 1977 (Carl Woese).  
- **Option 4**: Fossil evidence of extinct species was documented by Georges Cuvier (late 18th–early 19th century) and widely accepted before Darwin.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Incorrect. DNA's role in heredity was unknown before 1859.  
- **Option 2**: Incorrect. Mendel’s principles were published in 1866 and not established until decades later.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. Prokaryotic domains were classified in the late 20th century.  
- **Option 4**: Correct. Fossil evidence of extinction was well-documented by paleontologists like Cuvier prior to 1859.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  
- **Reasoning**: Fossil evidence of extinct species was established by early 19th-century paleontologists, predating Darwin’s 1859 publication. The other options involve discoveries made decades or centuries later.
