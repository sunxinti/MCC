**1. Question Analysis**
- The question is addressing a concept in population biology related to the dynamics of population growth. Specifically, it is asking for the term that describes the scenario where the birth rate (natality) and death rate (mortality) are equal, resulting in a stable population size.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**
- In population biology, several terms describe different population growth scenarios:
  - **Natality (Birth Rate):** The number of births in a population over a specific period.
  - **Mortality (Death Rate):** The number of deaths in a population over a specific period.
  - **Zero Population Growth (ZPG):** This occurs when the number of births equals the number of deaths, leading to a stable population size.
  - **Exponential Growth:** When the population size increases rapidly because the birth rate exceeds the death rate.
  - **Population Crash:** A sudden and significant decline in population size.
  - **Population Explosion:** A rapid and substantial increase in population size.
- Understanding these terms helps in identifying the correct term that matches the scenario where natality and mortality rates are equal.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **A Population Crash**
   - *Incorrect.* A population crash refers to a sudden and dramatic decrease in population size, not a scenario where birth and death rates are equal.
2. **A Population Explosion**
   - *Incorrect.* A population explosion describes a rapid and substantial increase in population size, typically when birth rates significantly exceed death rates.
3. **Zero Population Growth**
   - *Correct.* Zero population growth (ZPG) occurs when the birth rate equals the death rate, resulting in a stable population size.
4. **Exponential Growth**
   - *Incorrect.* Exponential growth refers to a situation where the population size increases rapidly because the birth rate exceeds the death rate.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks about the term used when the natality (birth rate) and mortality (death rate) of a population are equal. This relates to population dynamics and the phases of population growth models (e.g., exponential vs. logistic growth).  

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Natality and Mortality Balance**: When these rates are equal, the population size stabilizes because the number of new individuals entering the population (births) matches the number leaving (deaths).  
- **Population Growth Models**:  
  - **Exponential Growth**: Occurs when resources are unlimited, and birth rates exceed death rates.  
  - **Logistic Growth**: Accounts for limited resources, leading to a carrying capacity where growth slows and stops. The point where birth and death rates equalize is critical here.  
- **Zero Population Growth (ZPG)**: A demographic term where the number of births equals the number of deaths, resulting in no net population growth.  
- **Population Crash/Explosion**: These terms describe abrupt declines or rapid increases, respectively, and are not applicable when rates are balanced.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **a population crash**: Incorrect. A crash refers to a sharp decline in population, typically due to high mortality exceeding natality. This contradicts the question’s condition of equal rates.  
2. **a population explosion**: Incorrect. This describes rapid population growth (e.g., exponential growth), where natality far exceeds mortality. The question specifies equilibrium, not imbalance.  
3. **zero population growth (ZPG)**: Correct. ZPG explicitly defines the state where natality equals mortality, resulting in no net population change.  
4. **exponential growth**: Incorrect. Exponential growth occurs when natality exceeds mortality, leading to rapid population increase. The question requires equilibrium, not growth.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks for the term describing the point in population growth where natality (birth rate) equals mortality (death rate). This involves understanding population dynamics and terminology related to growth phases.

**2. Key Biological Considerations**  
- **Natality and Mortality Balance**: When birth rates equal death rates, the population's net growth rate is zero.  
- **Population Growth Phases**:  
  - **Exponential Growth**: Occurs when resources are abundant, and birth rates exceed death rates.  
  - **Zero Population Growth (ZPG)**: Equilibrium state with no net population change.  
  - **Population Crash/Explosion**: Terms for abrupt decline or rapid increase, respectively.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Population Crash)**: Incorrect. A crash implies a sudden decline, often due to mortality exceeding natality.  
- **Option 2 (Population Explosion)**: Incorrect. An explosion occurs when natality far exceeds mortality.  
- **Option 3 (Zero Population Growth)**: Correct. ZPG occurs precisely when births and deaths are balanced.  
- **Option 4 (Exponential Growth)**: Incorrect. Exponential growth requires sustained natality > mortality.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The term "zero population growth" directly corresponds to the equilibrium state where births and deaths are equal. Other options describe deviations from this equilibrium.  

**My final selection is: Option 3**
