问题: 
A 7-month-old infant, who was recently discharged from the hospital following an episode of enteritis and dehydration, has persistent watery diarrhea. His mother feeds him cow-milk formula and a variety of strained fruits and vegetables. On physical examination, his temperature is 37.4°C (99.3°F), his mucous membranes are dry, and his abdomen is slightly distended. No other abnormalities are seen. The problem is most likely related to which of the following?
选项: 
1. Fructose intolerance
2. Transient lactase deficiency
3. Magnesium deficiency
4. Regional enteritis

**1. Question Analysis**
- The question presents a clinical scenario involving a 7-month-old infant with persistent watery diarrhea following an episode of enteritis and dehydration. The infant is on a cow-milk formula and consumes strained fruits and vegetables. The physical examination reveals dry mucous membranes and a slightly distended abdomen. The question aims to identify the most likely underlying problem causing the persistent diarrhea from the given options.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**
- **Post-Enteritis Lactase Deficiency:** After an episode of enteritis (inflammation of the intestine), especially viral gastroenteritis, there can be a temporary reduction in the activity of lactase, the enzyme responsible for breaking down lactose in milk. This transient lactase deficiency can lead to lactose intolerance, resulting in osmotic diarrhea when lactose is inadequately absorbed and fermented in the colon.
- **Fructose Intolerance:** This is a condition where the body cannot properly metabolize fructose, leading to gastrointestinal symptoms. However, it is typically congenital (hereditary) fructose intolerance, which presents earlier in life when fructose is introduced into the diet.
- **Magnesium Deficiency:** While magnesium plays various roles in the body, deficiency is less likely to present primarily with watery diarrhea, especially in the acute post-enteritis setting.
- **Regional Enteritis (Crohn's Disease):** This is a type of inflammatory bowel disease characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. It usually presents with symptoms like abdominal pain, weight loss, and growth failure, and is less likely to present acutely following an episode of enteritis.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Fructose intolerance:** Incorrect. Typically presents earlier in life when fructose is introduced and is less likely to be a direct consequence of recent enteritis.
2. **Transient lactase deficiency:** Correct. Following an episode of enteritis, the intestinal mucosa can be damaged, leading to temporary lactase deficiency and subsequent lactose intolerance, causing persistent diarrhea.
3. **Magnesium deficiency:** Incorrect. Not commonly associated with acute watery diarrhea in this context.
4. **Regional enteritis:** Incorrect. This condition is chronic and does not typically present immediately after an acute episode of enteritis.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
This question focuses on identifying the cause of persistent watery diarrhea in a 7-month-old infant following hospitalization for enteritis and dehydration. The infant is fed cow-milk formula and strained fruits/vegetables. The clinical context suggests a post-infectious etiology or a condition related to dietary intake.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Post-infectious transient lactase deficiency**: Gastrointestinal infections (like enteritis) can damage intestinal villi, reducing lactase production. This leads to lactose malabsorption, causing osmotic diarrhea.  
- **Fructose intolerance**: A genetic disorder impairing fructose metabolism, causing diarrhea and bloating, but typically presents earlier and is less likely after a recent infection.  
- **Magnesium deficiency**: Can occur in prolonged diarrhea but is usually a secondary effect rather than the primary cause.  
- **Regional enteritis (Crohn’s disease)**: Rare in infants, typically presents with chronic inflammation, weight loss, and bloody diarrhea, which are absent here.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Fructose intolerance)**: Unlikely. While fruits might contain fructose, this condition is genetic and usually presents earlier, not after an infection.  
- **Option 2 (Transient lactase deficiency)**: Highly plausible. The recent enteritis likely damaged intestinal lactase, causing lactose malabsorption. Cow’s milk formula (lactose-containing) would exacerbate diarrhea.  
- **Option 3 (Magnesium deficiency)**: Less likely. Magnesium deficiency may develop *due to* diarrhea but is not the primary cause here.  
- **Option 4 (Regional enteritis)**: Very unlikely. The infant’s age and lack of chronic inflammatory symptoms (e.g., weight loss, blood in stool) make this improbable.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  

Transient lactase deficiency is the most likely diagnosis. The infant’s recent enteritis damaged intestinal villi, reducing lactase production. Continued consumption of cow’s milk formula (containing lactose) leads to lactose malabsorption, causing persistent watery diarrhea. This aligns with the clinical presentation and post-infectious context. Other options are inconsistent with the age, symptoms, or timeline.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question involves a 7-month-old infant with persistent watery diarrhea following hospitalization for enteritis and dehydration. The infant is fed cow-milk formula and strained fruits/vegetables. Key findings include dry mucous membranes (indicating dehydration) and abdominal distension. The task is to identify the most likely underlying cause from the options provided, focusing on post-enteritis complications and dietary factors.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Post-enteritis pathophysiology**: Viral or bacterial enteritis (e.g., rotavirus) can damage intestinal villi, leading to temporary loss of brush-border enzymes like lactase.  
- **Lactase deficiency**: Results in undigested lactose causing osmotic diarrhea, abdominal distension, and gas. Transient lactase deficiency is common after enteritis.  
- **Fructose intolerance**: Hereditary fructose intolerance causes symptoms upon fructose introduction (vomiting, hypoglycemia), but acquired intolerance is rare.  
- **Magnesium deficiency**: Causes neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., seizures) rather than diarrhea. Diarrhea may exacerbate magnesium loss, but deficiency itself is not a primary cause.  
- **Regional enteritis (Crohn’s disease)**: Extremely rare in infants; typically presents later in life with systemic symptoms (e.g., weight loss, growth failure).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Fructose intolerance)**: Unlikely. Hereditary fructose intolerance manifests earlier with severe symptoms (vomiting, hypoglycemia) upon fructose exposure. Acquired fructose malabsorption is rare in infants and less likely than lactase deficiency post-enteritis.  
- **Option 2 (Transient lactase deficiency)**: Highly plausible. Post-enteritis lactase deficiency is common, and continued lactose intake (cow-milk formula) exacerbates osmotic diarrhea and abdominal distension.  
- **Option 3 (Magnesium deficiency)**: Incorrect. Magnesium deficiency does not directly cause diarrhea; it is more likely a consequence of chronic fluid/electrolyte losses.  
- **Option 4 (Regional enteritis)**: Unlikely. Crohn’s disease is rare in infants and lacks hallmark features (e.g., growth failure, hematochezia).  

**4. Final Selection**  
The infant’s history of recent enteritis, ongoing lactose exposure via formula, and clinical features (watery diarrhea, abdominal distension) align with transient lactase deficiency. This condition resolves with lactose avoidance or enzyme recovery.  

**My final selection is: Option 2**
