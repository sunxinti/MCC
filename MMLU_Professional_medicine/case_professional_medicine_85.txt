问题: 
A 54-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe jaw pain since undergoing a painful dental procedure 1 day ago. The patient was prescribed codeine after the procedure and instructed to take the medication every 4 hours, but she has continued pain despite adherence to this analgesic regimen. Other members of her family also have experienced poor pain control with codeine. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this therapeutic failure?
选项: 
1. Decreased absorption of codeine
2. Decreased metabolism of codeine to morphine
3. Deficiency of κ receptors
4. Increased plasma protein-binding of codeine

GPT的完整回答:
================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question assesses the reasons behind the failure of codeine to provide adequate pain relief in a patient and her family members. It focuses on understanding the pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics of codeine metabolism.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Codeine Metabolism:** Codeine is a prodrug that requires conversion to morphine by the enzyme CYP2D6 to exert its analgesic effects.
- **Pharmacogenomics:** Genetic variations in CYP2D6 can lead to different metabolizer statuses:
  - **Poor Metabolizers:** Have reduced or non-functional CYP2D6, leading to insufficient conversion of codeine to morphine and inadequate pain relief.
  - **Ultra-Rapid Metabolizers:** Convert codeine to morphine more quickly, increasing the risk of toxicity.
- **Family History:** The fact that other family members also experience poor pain control with codeine suggests a hereditary factor affecting metabolism, such as a CYP2D6 polymorphism.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Decreased absorption of codeine**
   - *Incorrect.* Decreased absorption would reduce the overall availability of codeine, but the familial pattern suggests a genetic metabolic issue rather than an absorption problem.
2. **Decreased metabolism of codeine to morphine**
   - *Correct.* This aligns with CYP2D6 poor metabolizer status, leading to inadequate conversion of codeine to its active form, morphine, resulting in poor pain control.
3. **Deficiency of κ receptors**
   - *Incorrect.* Codeine primarily acts on μ-opioid receptors, not κ receptors. A deficiency in κ receptors would not directly explain the poor response to codeine.
4. **Increased plasma protein-binding of codeine**
   - *Incorrect.* Increased protein binding would decrease free codeine levels, but this is less likely to be the cause of inadequate pain control compared to impaired metabolism, especially given the family history.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question addresses therapeutic failure of codeine in a patient with a family history of poor pain control using the same medication. The focus is on understanding why codeine is ineffective despite proper adherence, with a genetic component likely involved.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Codeine Metabolism**: Codeine is a prodrug that requires biotransformation by the enzyme CYP2D6 into morphine to exert its analgesic effects. Only about 10% of codeine’s analgesic effect is due to codeine itself; the majority relies on its conversion to morphine.  
- **Genetic Variability**: CYP2D6 activity varies widely due to genetic polymorphisms. Poor metabolizers (due to CYP2D6 gene mutations) convert little codeine to morphine, leading to inadequate pain relief. This trait is hereditary, explaining the family history noted in the question.  
- **Receptor Specificity**: Morphine primarily acts on μ-opioid receptors, not κ receptors (option 3).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Decreased absorption of codeine)**: Unlikely. Absorption issues (e.g., GI problems) would not explain the familial pattern. Codeine is well-absorbed orally, and the question does not suggest malabsorption etiologies.  
- **Option 2 (Decreased metabolism of codeine to morphine)**: Correct. Poor CYP2D6 metabolism (a genetic deficiency) prevents codeine from converting to morphine, resulting in therapeutic failure. The family history strongly supports this mechanism.  
- **Option 3 (Deficiency of κ receptors)**: Incorrect. Codeine’s analgesic effect depends on morphine’s action at μ receptors, not κ receptors. A κ receptor deficiency would not explain the lack of pain relief.  
- **Option 4 (Increased plasma protein-binding of codeine)**: Unlikely. While protein-binding affects drug availability, this is not hereditary and does not directly impair codeine’s conversion to morphine.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  

**Explanation**: The patient’s poor response to codeine and family history point to a genetic deficiency in CYP2D6 enzyme activity. This enzyme is critical for converting codeine to morphine, the active analgesic. Without sufficient CYP2D6 activity, codeine cannot be metabolized effectively, leading to therapeutic failure. The hereditary nature of CYP2D6 polymorphisms aligns with the family’s shared experience of inadequate pain control. Other options do not account for the genetic component or the pharmacokinetic pathway of codeine.

DeepSeek的完整回答:
================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question explores why codeine fails to relieve pain in a patient and her family, focusing on pharmacogenetic mechanisms affecting codeine metabolism. Key concepts include prodrug activation, CYP2D6 polymorphisms, and opioid receptor biology.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Codeine Pharmacology**: Codeine is a prodrug requiring conversion to morphine (via CYP2D6) for analgesic effects.  
- **CYP2D6 Polymorphisms**: Genetic variations (e.g., poor metabolizers) reduce morphine production, diminishing efficacy.  
- **Hereditary Patterns**: Family history of poor codeine response suggests a genetic basis, commonly CYP2D6 deficiency.  
- **Receptor Specificity**: Codeine-derived morphine primarily acts on μ-opioid receptors, not κ receptors.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Decreased absorption**: Unlikely. Codeine is well-absorbed orally, and no clinical evidence (e.g., GI disorders) supports malabsorption. Familial pattern is better explained by genetics.  
2. **Decreased metabolism to morphine**: Correct. Poor CYP2D6 activity (common in ~10% of Caucasians) prevents codeine activation, explaining therapeutic failure and familial occurrence.  
3. **κ receptor deficiency**: Irrelevant. Codeine’s analgesia depends on μ receptors, not κ receptors. Receptor deficiencies are rare and not typically familial.  
4. **Increased plasma protein-binding**: Unlikely. Codeine has low protein binding (~7%), and altered binding is not a recognized cause of familial resistance.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The patient and her family likely have reduced CYP2D6 activity (poor metabolizers), impairing codeine’s conversion to morphine. This aligns with genetic inheritance and explains therapeutic failure.  

**My final selection is: Option 2**
