问题: 
A 17-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after being found with a "blank stare" and flat facial expression at a party. His pulse is 72/min, and blood pressure is 104/68 mm Hg. He is sitting upright and appears catatonic. Physical examination shows rigidity. During the examination, he becomes hostile and attempts to assault the physician. This patient most likely ingested which of the following drugs?
选项: 
1. Diazepam

**1. Question Analysis**
- The question presents a clinical scenario of a 17-year-old boy exhibiting acute behavioral and physical changes after a party. The patient displays a "blank stare," flat facial expression, catatonia, rigidity, and suddenly becomes hostile. The task is to identify the most likely ingested drug from the provided options based on these symptoms.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**
- **Catatonia and Rigidity:** These symptoms suggest alterations in the central nervous system (CNS), potentially due to substance ingestion.
- **Autonomic Signs:** A pulse of 72/min and blood pressure of 104/68 mm Hg indicate relatively stable vital signs, which can help differentiate between sympathomimetic and sedative substances.
- **Behavioral Changes:** Sudden aggression and hostility may indicate stimulant use or dissociative agents.
- **Onset and Context:** The acute presentation (30 minutes after ingestion) at a party setting is consistent with recreational drug use.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Diazepam:**
   - *Classification:* Benzodiazepine.
   - *Effects:* Primarily causes CNS depression, leading to drowsiness, muscle relaxation, and sedation.
   - *Symptoms in Overdose:* Respiratory depression, hypotonia, but not typically aggression or rigidity.
   - *Conclusion:* Incorrect.

2. **Methamphetamine:**
   - *Classification:* Stimulant.
   - *Effects:* Increases alertness, euphoria, elevated heart rate, and blood pressure.
   - *Symptoms in Overdose:* Agitation, hyperthermia, tachycardia, hypertension.
   - *Patient’s Vitals:* Presenting with a lower pulse and blood pressure contradicts typical methamphetamine effects.
   - *Conclusion:* Incorrect.

3. **Oxycodone:**
   - *Classification:* Opioid analgesic.
   - *Effects:* Causes CNS and respiratory depression, euphoria, and analgesia.
   - *Symptoms in Overdose:* Miosis (pinpoint pupils), respiratory depression, sedation.
   - *Conclusion:* Incorrect, as opioids typically cause miosis and not aggression or rigidity.

4. **PCP (Phencyclidine):**
   - *Classification:* Dissociative anesthetic.
   - *Effects:* Causes hallucinations, altered perceptions, agitation, and aggressive behavior.
   - *Symptoms in Use/Overdose:* Nystagmus, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia or bradycardia, rigidity, and violent behavior.
   - *Conclusion:* Correct, as the patient's symptoms align well with PCP intoxication.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks to identify the drug most likely responsible for a 17-year-old patient presenting with catatonia (blank stare, flat affect, rigidity) followed by sudden hostility and assaultive behavior. The scenario involves acute drug intoxication with characteristic neuropsychiatric symptoms.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **PCP Intoxication**: Known to cause a dissociative state with catatonia (stupor, rigidity, unresponsiveness) initially, followed by agitation, paranoia, and violence. Vital signs may vary but can include normal or elevated blood pressure.  
- **Benzodiazepines (e.g., Diazepam)**: Typically cause CNS depression, leading to sedation, hypotension, and respiratory suppression, not hostility or rigidity. Paradoxical reactions (agitation) are rare but possible in children.  
- **Methamphetamine**: A stimulant causing hyperactivity, tachycardia, hypertension, and aggression. However, it does not typically cause initial catatonia or rigidity.  
- **Oxycodone (Opioid)**: Causes CNS depression, including sedation, miosis, and respiratory depression. Aggression or rigidity are atypical unless in withdrawal.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Diazepam)**: Incorrect. Benzodiazepines like diazepam suppress the CNS, leading to sedation and muscle relaxation, not rigidity or hostility. The sudden shift to aggression is inconsistent with benzodiazepine effects.  
- **Option 2 (Methamphetamine)**: Incorrect. Methamphetamine intoxication typically presents with hyperadrenergic symptoms (tachycardia, hypertension) and agitation, but not catatonia or rigidity. The patient’s normal blood pressure also makes this less likely.  
- **Option 3 (Oxycodone)**: Incorrect. Opioids like oxycodone cause CNS depression, sedation, and potential respiratory compromise. Hostility and rigidity are not typical unless in withdrawal, which does not align with the described presentation.  
- **Option 4 (PCP)**: Correct. PCP intoxication is characterized by a dissociative state with catatonia (stupor, rigidity, blank expression) followed by abrupt shifts to violent or aggressive behavior. The vital signs (normal blood pressure) and the sequence of symptoms (initial catatonia progressing to hostility) are classic for PCP.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  
PCP intoxication is the most accurate answer because it uniquely explains the combination of initial catatonia (blank stare, rigidity) and subsequent hostility/aggression. Benzodiazepines, methamphetamine, and oxycodone do not present with this specific symptom progression. PCP’s dissociative effects and potential for violent behavioral shifts make it the best fit.

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks to identify the drug causing a combination of **catatonia, rigidity, and sudden aggression** in a teenager with normal vital signs. The key clinical features are the progression from a blank stare/catatonic state to violent behavior.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Catatonia with rigidity** suggests altered sensorimotor processing.  
- **Hostility/aggression** points to a substance causing disinhibition or psychosis.  
- **Normal vitals** (pulse, BP) help exclude sympathomimetic drugs (e.g., methamphetamine) or severe CNS depressants (e.g., opioids, benzodiazepines).  
- **PCP** is notorious for causing dissociative states, catatonic features, rigidity, and violent outbursts.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Diazepam**  
  - Benzodiazepines cause sedation, muscle relaxation, and respiratory depression. **Rigidity and aggression are inconsistent**. Incorrect.  
- **Option 2: Methamphetamine**  
  - Causes hypertension, tachycardia, hyperalertness, and agitation. **No catatonia or rigidity**. Incorrect.  
- **Option 3: Oxycodone**  
  - Opioids cause miosis, respiratory depression, and sedation. **Rigidity and aggression are absent**. Incorrect.  
- **Option 4: PCP (phencyclidine)**  
  - Induces **dissociation, catatonia, nystagmus, rigidity, and unpredictable aggression**. Matches the clinical presentation. Correct.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  
PCP explains the catatonic rigidity, flat affect, and sudden hostility. Other drugs lack the combination of dissociation, motor abnormalities, and aggression seen here.
