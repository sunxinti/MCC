问题: 
A 77-year-old man is brought to the physician because of a 12-hour history of word-finding difficulty and weakness and sensory loss of the right arm and leg. He has no history of similar symptoms. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. Current medications include metformin, lisinopril, and aspirin. He is alert. His pulse is 80/min and irregular, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 170/90 mm Hg. He follows commands but has nonfluent aphasia. There is moderate weakness and decreased sensation of the right upper and lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Babinski sign is present on the right. His serum glucose concentration is 162 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?
选项: 
1. Carotid duplex ultrasonography
2. CT scan of the head
3. EEG
4. Lumbar puncture

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question presents a clinical scenario involving a 77-year-old man with acute neurological symptoms, including word-finding difficulty (nonfluent aphasia), right-sided weakness and sensory loss, and the presence of Babinski sign. The question asks for the most appropriate next diagnostic step given his presentation and medical history.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Acute Stroke Evaluation:** The patient's sudden onset of neurological deficits suggests a cerebrovascular event, such as ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke.
- **Risk Factors:** His history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation (irregular pulse), diabetes mellitus, and age are significant risk factors for stroke.
- **Clinical Signs:** Nonfluent aphasia indicates involvement of Broca's area, likely in the left hemisphere. Right-sided weakness and sensory loss, along with a Babinski sign, suggest an upper motor neuron lesion affecting the contralateral side.
- **Immediate Management:** Rapid differentiation between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke is crucial for appropriate treatment, especially if thrombolytic therapy is being considered.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Carotid duplex ultrasonography:** This imaging modality assesses carotid artery stenosis, which is a risk factor for ischemic stroke but is not the immediate diagnostic step in the acute setting.
2. **CT scan of the head:** A non-contrast CT scan is the standard initial imaging study to differentiate between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, guiding further management.
3. **EEG:** Electroencephalography is used to evaluate seizure activity, which is not the primary concern in this clinical presentation.
4. **Lumbar puncture:** This procedure is indicated if a subarachnoid hemorrhage is suspected and the CT scan is inconclusive, which is not the first-line approach in this scenario.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question involves a patient presenting with acute neurological deficits (aphasia, right-sided weakness/sensory loss) and risk factors for cerebrovascular disease (hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation). The task is to determine the most appropriate next diagnostic step to evaluate for stroke or other neurological emergencies.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Stroke Workup**: In acute neurological deficits, the immediate priority is to differentiate ischemic stroke from hemorrhagic stroke because treatment differs drastically (e.g., thrombolytics contraindicated in hemorrhage).  
- **Time Frame**: Symptoms started 12 hours prior. While beyond the typical 4.5-hour window for alteplase (tPA), imaging remains critical to confirm ischemia/hemorrhage and guide management.  
- **Clinical Features**: Left hemisphere involvement (aphasia, right-sided deficits) suggests a stroke. Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of cardioembolic stroke.  
- **Differential Diagnoses**: Exclude hemorrhage, tumor, or posterior fossa stroke. Lumbar puncture (e.g., for subarachnoid hemorrhage) is contraindicated without first ruling out intracranial hemorrhage via imaging.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Carotid duplex ultrasonography):** Useful for evaluating carotid artery stenosis, but not the first-line test in acute stroke. It addresses etiology rather than immediate diagnosis.  
- **Option 2 (CT scan of the head):** **Correct.** CT is the initial imaging modality for acute stroke to rule out hemorrhage and assess for ischemic changes. It is safe, rapid, and widely available.  
- **Option 3 (EEG):** EEG is not useful for acute stroke diagnosis. It evaluates electrical activity and is indicated for seizure or encephalopathy, which are not suggested here.  
- **Option 4 (Lumbar puncture):** Contraindicated in acute stroke until CT excludes hemorrhage. LP could be considered if subarachnoid hemorrhage is suspected *after* CT, but this is not the case here.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  

The head CT is the most appropriate next step to rapidly differentiate ischemic from hemorrhagic stroke, guide acute management, and exclude other critical diagnoses. Other options are either contraindicated (lumbar puncture), non-urgent (carotid ultrasound), or irrelevant (EEG) in this clinical scenario.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question involves a patient presenting with acute focal neurological deficits (nonfluent aphasia, right-sided weakness/sensory loss, and Babinski sign), suggesting a stroke. The task is to identify the most appropriate initial diagnostic step among imaging, vascular studies, neurophysiology, or cerebrospinal fluid analysis.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Stroke Evaluation**: Acute focal neurological deficits require immediate imaging to distinguish ischemic stroke from hemorrhagic stroke.  
- **Atrial Fibrillation**: A major risk factor for cardioembolic stroke.  
- **Time Sensitivity**: CT scan is the first-line imaging modality in acute stroke to rule out hemorrhage and guide treatment (e.g., thrombolysis).  
- **Other Diagnostics**: Carotid imaging (for arterial stenosis), EEG (seizures), and LP (subarachnoid hemorrhage/infection) are secondary to initial CT in this context.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Carotid duplex ultrasonography**: Assesses carotid stenosis but is not urgent here. Atrial fibrillation suggests a cardioembolic source, making carotid imaging less immediate. **Incorrect**.  
2. **CT scan of the head**: Critical to exclude hemorrhage and confirm ischemic stroke. Required before any intervention. **Correct**.  
3. **EEG**: Indicated for suspected seizures, but the patient lacks episodic or seizure-like features. **Incorrect**.  
4. **Lumbar puncture**: Used if subarachnoid hemorrhage is suspected despite normal CT or for infection. No clinical signs (e.g., headache, fever) support this. **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The patient’s presentation and comorbidities strongly suggest an acute ischemic stroke. Immediate CT head is mandatory to exclude hemorrhage and establish a diagnosis, guiding further management (e.g., thrombolysis eligibility).  

**My final selection is: Option 2**
