**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question presents a scenario involving a knee injury in a 19-year-old male, specifically after being hit from behind below the right knee during football. Key findings include lack of fluid motion in gait, negative standing flexion test, intact cruciate and collateral knee ligaments, and the presence of foot drop on the right side. The question seeks to identify the most likely diagnosis based on these clinical findings.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Foot Drop:** This condition is characterized by difficulty in dorsiflexing the foot, leading to dragging of the foot during walking. It is often caused by dysfunction of the common peroneal nerve.
- **Common Peroneal Nerve Anatomy:** The nerve wraps around the neck of the fibula near the fibular head. Trauma or deviation of the fibular head can compress or injure the nerve, leading to foot drop.
- **Mechanism of Injury:** Being hit from behind below the knee suggests a potential impact on the structures near the fibular head rather than the knee ligaments.
- **Other Options Consideration:**
  - **Anteriorly Deviated Distal Femur:** This is uncommon and not typically associated with foot drop.
  - **Plantar Flexed Cuboid:** Issues with the cuboid bone usually affect foot mechanics but are not directly linked to nerve injury causing foot drop.
  - **Unilateral Sacral Shear:** This pertains to pelvic injuries and does not correlate with foot drop.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Anteriorly Deviated Distal Femur:** Incorrect. Deviation of the distal femur is rare and does not directly impact the common peroneal nerve responsible for foot drop.
2. **Plantar Flexed Cuboid:** Incorrect. While the cuboid bone plays a role in foot mechanics, its plantar flexion does not cause foot drop.
3. **Posteriorly Deviated Fibular Head:** Correct. Deviation of the fibular head can compress or injure the common peroneal nerve, leading to foot drop.
4. **Unilateral Sacral Shear:** Incorrect. This relates to pelvic injuries and has no direct connection to foot drop.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question involves evaluating a patient with a traumatic injury to the right lower leg/knee after a football injury. Key findings include gait abnormalities (lack of fluid motion), intact cruciate and collateral ligaments, negative standing flexion test, and foot drop. The task is to identify the underlying anatomical or mechanical issue causing these symptoms.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Mechanism of Injury**: A posterior impact below the knee could affect structures near the fibular head, such as the common peroneal nerve or fibula itself.  
- **Foot Drop**: Indicates weakness in dorsiflexion, which is caused by injury to the **common peroneal nerve** (innervates tibialis anterior and other dorsiflexors). This nerve wraps around the fibular neck, making it vulnerable to injury from trauma or compression in that region.  
- **Standing Flexion Test**: Negative result rules out meniscal tears, as the test is used to detect joint line tenderness or effusion.  
- **Intact Ligaments**: Rules out ACL/PCL or collateral ligament injuries.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Anteriorly deviated distal femur**:  
   - An anterior deviation of the distal femur would affect knee alignment but is unrelated to foot drop. This is more associated with malunion or congenital deformities, not trauma to the posterior knee. **Incorrect**.  

2. **Plantar flexed cuboid**:  
   - A plantar flexed cuboid (Cuboid syndrome) causes lateral foot pain and altered gait but does not directly cause foot drop. Foot drop requires nerve/muscle dysfunction, not a foot bone malposition. **Incorrect**.  

3. **Posteriorly deviated fibular head**:  
   - The common peroneal nerve runs around the fibular neck. A posterior deviation of the fibular head (e.g., due to a fracture or dislocation from trauma) could compress or stretch this nerve, leading to foot drop. This directly aligns with the mechanism (posterior knee injury) and symptom (dorsiflexion weakness). **Correct**.  

4. **Unilateral sacral shear**:  
   - Sacral shear injuries involve the pelvic region and typically cause low back pain or radiculopathy. They do not explain isolated foot drop from a lower leg injury. **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  

The posteriorly deviated fibular head is the most likely diagnosis. The patient’s mechanism of injury (posterior impact below the knee) and foot drop (common peroneal nerve dysfunction) are classically linked to nerve injury at the fibular neck. This injury site directly compresses or damages the nerve, causing the observed weakness in dorsiflexion. The other options fail to explain the specific anatomical and neurological findings.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question involves a traumatic injury below the knee leading to foot drop, gait abnormalities, and intact knee ligaments. The goal is to identify the structural injury most likely causing these findings, focusing on nerve involvement and biomechanical principles.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Foot drop**: Typically caused by weakness/paralysis of dorsiflexors (anterior tibialis, extensor digitorum longus), innervated by the **common peroneal (fibular) nerve**.  
- **Common peroneal nerve anatomy**: Wraps superficially around the **fibular neck**, making it susceptible to compression or trauma from fibular head displacement.  
- **Mechanism of injury**: A direct blow posteriorly below the knee could displace the fibular head posteriorly, compressing the nerve.  
- **Standing flexion test**: Negative result suggests no sacroiliac joint dysfunction, ruling out sacral involvement.  
- **Intact knee ligaments**: Excludes ligamentous knee injuries as the cause of symptoms.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Anteriorly deviated distal femur**  
  The distal femur is proximal to the knee joint. An anterior deviation would disrupt knee mechanics or ligaments, which are intact. Unrelated to foot drop. **Incorrect**.  

- **Option 2: Plantar flexed cuboid**  
  The cuboid is a midfoot bone. Plantar flexion here could cause midfoot instability or pain but does not affect the common peroneal nerve. **Incorrect**.  

- **Option 3: Posteriorly deviated fibular head**  
  Posterior displacement of the fibular head directly compresses the common peroneal nerve at its vulnerable fibular neck location. This explains foot drop and aligns with the injury mechanism. **Correct**.  

- **Option 4: Unilateral sacral shear**  
  Sacral shear affects sacroiliac joints or lumbosacral nerves. A negative standing flexion test and the injury location (below the knee) make this unlikely. **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The mechanism (direct blow below the knee), foot drop (common peroneal nerve injury), and exclusion of other causes (intact ligaments, negative sacroiliac testing) confirm **posteriorly deviated fibular head** as the diagnosis.  

**My final selection is: Option 3**
