问题: 
A 40-year-old man comes to the office for a preemployment physical examination. The patient has been generally healthy. Medical history is unremarkable and he takes no routine medications. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination shows a palpable nodule in the right lobe of the thyroid gland. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration is within the reference range. Ultrasonography of the thyroid gland confirms a solid, 1-cm nodule. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
选项: 
1. CT scan of the neck
2. Fine-needle aspiration of the nodule
3. Radionuclide thyroid scan
4. Thyroidectomy

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question focuses on the appropriate next step in evaluating a thyroid nodule identified during a routine physical examination. It presents a scenario of a generally healthy 40-year-old man with a solid, 1-cm thyroid nodule confirmed by ultrasonography and a normal serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Thyroid Nodules:** Common in the general population, especially in adults. The primary concern is distinguishing between benign and malignant nodules.
- **TSH Levels:** A normal TSH suggests that the nodule is not hyperfunctioning. If TSH were low, a radionuclide thyroid scan might be indicated to assess for a benign hyperfunctioning nodule.
- **Nodule Size and Characteristics:** Nodules ≥1 cm with suspicious features on ultrasound typically warrant further evaluation due to a higher risk of malignancy.
- **Fine-Needle Aspiration (FNA):** Considered the gold standard for evaluating thyroid nodules larger than 1 cm, especially when there are concerning features on imaging or patient history.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: CT scan of the neck**  
  - *Assessment:* Not typically the first-line investigation for a thyroid nodule. CT scans are more useful for evaluating the extent of disease if malignancy is suspected based on prior findings.
  - *Conclusion:* Incorrect.

- **Option 2: Fine-needle aspiration of the nodule**  
  - *Assessment:* Aligns with clinical guidelines for nodules ≥1 cm, especially when discovered incidentally. FNA allows for cytological evaluation to assess the risk of cancer.
  - *Conclusion:* Correct.

- **Option 3: Radionuclide thyroid scan**  
  - *Assessment:* Indicated primarily when TSH is low to determine if the nodule is hyperfunctioning (hot) or non-functioning (cold). With a normal TSH, this scan is not the next appropriate step.
  - *Conclusion:* Incorrect.

- **Option 4: Thyroidectomy**  
  - *Assessment:* An invasive procedure that should only be considered after confirming malignancy or if the nodule causes compressive symptoms. It is premature without further evaluation.
  - *Conclusion:* Incorrect.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question involves evaluating a thyroid nodule in an asymptomatic patient with normal thyroid function. The key is determining the appropriate next diagnostic step based on nodule characteristics and evidence-based guidelines.  

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Thyroid Nodule Evaluation Guidelines**: The American Thyroid Association (ATA) recommends fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy for solid nodules ≥1 cm in size, regardless of thyroid function tests (TSH levels), due to the risk of malignancy.  
- **Ultrasound Features**: A solid nodule is more concerning than a cystic one. The size (1 cm) meets the threshold for FNA.  
- **Role of Radionuclide Scan**: Such scans categorize nodules as "hot" (functioning, low-risk) or "cold" (non-functioning, higher-risk). However, ATA guidelines prioritize ultrasound and FNA over radionuclide scans for initial evaluation in most cases.  
- **Indications for Surgery**: Thyroidectomy is reserved for confirmed malignancy or symptomatic nodules, not as an initial step.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (CT scan of the neck)**: Unnecessary unless there is suspicion of invasion, lymph node involvement, or other structural abnormalities, which are not indicated here.  
- **Option 2 (Fine-needle aspiration)**: Correct. FNA is the standard initial diagnostic test for solid thyroid nodules ≥1 cm to assess for malignancy.  
- **Option 3 (Radionuclide thyroid scan)**: Less prioritized in current guidelines. Even if the nodule were "hot" (unlikely given it is solid), FNA is still recommended for solid lesions ≥1 cm.  
- **Option 4 (Thyroidectomy)**: Inappropriate as an initial step. Surgery is only considered after diagnostic confirmation of malignancy or in cases of significant symptoms.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  
Fine-needle aspiration is the most appropriate next step. It directly evaluates the nodule’s cytology to assess for malignancy, aligning with guidelines for solid nodules ≥1 cm. Other options are either unnecessary (CT, thyroidectomy) or secondary (radionuclide scan).

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question addresses the evaluation of a thyroid nodule in a euthyroid patient. Key elements include a solid 1-cm nodule confirmed by ultrasound and normal TSH. The task is to determine the appropriate next diagnostic step based on current guidelines.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Thyroid Nodule Workup**: Initial evaluation includes TSH measurement. If TSH is normal (euthyroid), ultrasound is the primary imaging modality.  
- **ATA Guidelines**: For euthyroid patients, fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is indicated for nodules ≥1 cm with suspicious ultrasound features (e.g., solid composition, hypoechogenicity, irregular margins). Even in the absence of high-risk features, solid nodules ≥1 cm typically warrant FNA.  
- **Radionuclide Scan**: Reserved for nodules with suppressed TSH (suspected hyperfunctioning nodules).  
- **Imaging/Surgery**: CT is not preferred for initial evaluation. Thyroidectomy requires prior cytologic confirmation of malignancy or compressive symptoms.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **CT scan of the neck**: Not indicated. Ultrasound is superior for thyroid nodule characterization, and CT adds radiation without diagnostic benefit in this scenario.  
2. **Fine-needle aspiration of the nodule**: Correct. A solid 1-cm nodule in a euthyroid patient meets criteria for FNA per guidelines, regardless of additional ultrasound features.  
3. **Radionuclide thyroid scan**: Unnecessary. Radionuclide scans are used when TSH is low to assess for hyperfunctioning nodules, which are rarely malignant.  
4. **Thyroidectomy**: Premature. Surgery requires prior cytologic evidence of malignancy or significant clinical suspicion.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  
FNA is the standard next step for a solid 1-cm thyroid nodule in a euthyroid patient. This aligns with evidence-based guidelines to exclude malignancy, while other options are either inappropriate (CT, radionuclide scan) or invasive without prior diagnostic confirmation (thyroidectomy).
