问题: 
A study is conducted to assess the effectiveness of a new drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. A total of 1000 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are enrolled. Patients are randomly assigned to receive the new drug or standard treatment. The alpha and beta values for calculating probability are 0.05 and 0.20, respectively. Results show that the new drug is significantly better than standard treatment. If this study had been performed in a population of only 500 patients, which of the following would have been most likely to increase?
选项: 
1. Chance of a type I error
2. Chance of a type II error
3. Power of the study
4. Sensitivity of the study

**1. Question Analysis**
- The question examines the impact of reducing the sample size in a clinical study on statistical errors and study power. Specifically, it assesses how decreasing the number of participants from 1000 to 500 affects the probabilities of type I and type II errors, as well as the study's power and sensitivity.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**
- **Type I Error (α):** The probability of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. It is typically set at 0.05.
- **Type II Error (β):** The probability of failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false. It is related to the study's power, which is 1 - β.
- **Study Power:** The probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false. Higher power reduces the likelihood of a type II error.
- **Sensitivity:** In diagnostic studies, sensitivity refers to the test's ability to correctly identify those with the disease. However, in the context of this study, sensitivity is less directly relevant.
- Reducing the sample size generally decreases the study's power, increasing the likelihood of a type II error, while the probability of a type I error remains unchanged if the alpha level is maintained.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Chance of a type I error:** The alpha value (0.05) determines the probability of a type I error. Reducing the sample size does not inherently change the alpha level; thus, the chance of a type I error remains the same.
2. **Chance of a type II error:** With a smaller sample size, the study has less power to detect a true effect, increasing the probability of a type II error.
3. **Power of the study:** Power decreases with a smaller sample size, making it less likely to detect a true effect.
4. **Sensitivity of the study:** Sensitivity is not directly impacted by the sample size in this context, as it pertains more to diagnostic test characteristics.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question examines the impact of reducing sample size on statistical errors and study power in a clinical trial comparing a new drug to standard treatment for type 2 diabetes. The key concepts involve understanding Type I and Type II errors, statistical power, and how sample size influences these parameters.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Type I Error (α):** Probability of falsely rejecting a true null hypothesis (e.g., concluding the new drug works when it does not). Set at 0.05 in this study.  
- **Type II Error (β):** Probability of failing to reject a false null hypothesis (e.g., missing a true effect of the new drug). Set at 0.20, giving the study 80% power (1 - β).  
- **Statistical Power:** The probability of correctly detecting an effect if it exists. Power increases with larger sample sizes, lower variability, and larger effect sizes.  
- **Sample Size:** Reducing sample size decreases statistical power, making it harder to detect true effects (increasing β) and increasing the risk of Type II errors.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Chance of a Type I Error (α):**  
   - α is fixed at 0.05 by design. Unless the significance threshold is changed, reducing sample size does not directly affect Type I error probability.  
   - **Incorrect.**  

2. **Chance of a Type II Error (β):**  
   - With fewer patients (500 vs. 1000), the study’s power decreases, leading to a higher probability of missing a true effect (increased β).  
   - **Correct.**  

3. **Power of the Study:**  
   - Power is directly tied to sample size. Halving the sample size would reduce power (since power = 1 - β), not increase it.  
   - **Incorrect.**  

4. **Sensitivity of the Study:**  
   - Sensitivity refers to a diagnostic test’s ability to correctly identify true positives. This term is unrelated to statistical power or error rates in clinical trials.  
   - **Incorrect.**  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  

Reducing the sample size from 1000 to 500 decreases the study’s power, which directly increases the probability of a Type II error (β). The Type I error rate (α) remains fixed at 0.05 unless explicitly altered. Power and sensitivity are unrelated to the question’s parameters in this context.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks how reducing the sample size from 1000 to 500 in a clinical trial affects statistical outcomes (type I/II errors, power, sensitivity). It focuses on understanding the relationship between sample size, statistical power, and error probabilities in hypothesis testing.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Type I error (α)**: Probability of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis (false positive). Fixed at 0.05 in this study.  
- **Type II error (β)**: Probability of failing to reject a false null hypothesis (false negative). β = 0.20 in the original study.  
- **Power (1 - β)**: Probability of correctly detecting a true effect. Initially 80% (1 - 0.20).  
- **Sample size impact**: Smaller samples reduce power (increase β) but do not directly affect α (preset by the researcher). Sensitivity, often used in diagnostic testing, is irrelevant here.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Type I error)**: Incorrect. α is predetermined (0.05) and independent of sample size.  
- **Option 2 (Type II error)**: Correct. Reducing sample size decreases power, increasing β (type II error risk).  
- **Option 3 (Power)**: Incorrect. Power decreases with smaller samples (opposite of what is asked).  
- **Option 4 (Sensitivity)**: Incorrect. Sensitivity pertains to diagnostic tests, not study power or error rates.  

**4. Final Selection**  
Reducing the sample size reduces the study's ability to detect true effects (lower power), directly increasing the likelihood of a type II error. Sensitivity is not applicable, and type I error remains unchanged.  

**My final selection is: Option 2**
