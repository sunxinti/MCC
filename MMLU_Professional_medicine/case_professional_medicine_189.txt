**1. Question Analysis**
- The question describes a 17-year-old female patient presenting with primary amenorrhea (never having had a menstrual period). Physical examination reveals a normal female body habitus, normal breast development, and normal-appearing external genitalia. Notably, she lacks axillary and pubic hair. The question seeks the most likely medical explanation for this clinical presentation from four provided options.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**
- **Primary Amenorrhea**: Defined as the absence of menstruation by age 15 in girls with secondary sexual characteristics or by 13 without them.
- **Secondary Sexual Characteristics**: Normal breast development suggests adequate estrogen levels.
- **Absent Axillary and Pubic Hair**: Typically androgen-dependent; their absence may indicate a lack of androgen action or production.
- **Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS)**: A condition where individuals with a 46,XY karyotype have a partial or complete inability to respond to androgens, leading to feminization of external genitalia.
- **Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)**: A group of genetic conditions limiting hormone production in the adrenal glands, often leading to excess androgen production, which usually causes virilization, including pubic and axillary hair.
- **Ectodermal Dysplasia**: A disorder affecting the development of ectodermal structures like hair, teeth, and sweat glands, which could explain absent pubic and axillary hair but not necessarily primary amenorrhea.
- **Psychiatric Disorders**: Can lead to functional amenorrhea, but do not typically affect pubic and axillary hair growth directly.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Androgen insensitivity**: 
   - **Correct**. AIS explains primary amenorrhea with normal female external genitalia and breast development due to peripheral aromatization of androgens to estrogens. The absence of pubic and axillary hair is consistent with the body's inability to respond to androgens.
   
2. **Congenital adrenal hyperplasia**:
   - **Incorrect**. CAH usually results in excess androgen production, leading to the development of pubic and axillary hair, which is contrary to the patient's presentation.
   
3. **Ectodermal dysplasia**:
   - **Incorrect**. While it can result in absent hair, it does not typically cause primary amenorrhea with normal breast development and external genitalia without other ectodermal anomalies.
   
4. **A psychiatric disorder**:
   - **Incorrect**. Psychiatric conditions may lead to functional amenorrhea but do not explain the absence of pubic and axillary hair, which suggests an underlying physiological issue.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question involves a case of primary amenorrhea in a 17-year-old with normal female body habitus, breast development, and external genitalia but absent axillary/pubic hair. The key is to identify the underlying condition causing the absence of menstruation and androgen insensitivity despite estrogen-driven secondary sexual characteristics.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Primary Amenorrhea**: Absence of menstruation by age 16 with normal breast development or by age 14 without breast development.  
- **Normal Breast Development**: Indicates functional estrogen, which requires either endogenous estrogen production or androgen-to-estrogen conversion (e.g., via aromatase).  
- **Absent Axillary/Pubic Hair**: Suggests impaired androgen action or production.  
- **Normal External Genitalia**: Rules out severe virilization (e.g., congenital adrenal hyperplasia) but does not exclude conditions like androgen insensitivity.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Androgen Insensitivity (AI)**  
  - **Correct**: Complete AI (CAIS) is caused by mutations in the androgen receptor gene. Affected individuals are genetically male (46,XY) but develop female external genitalia. Breast development occurs due to estrogen production (testosterone aromatized to estradiol). Lack of pubic/axillary hair stems from androgen resistance. The normal external genitalia and breast development align with CAIS.  
- **Option 2: Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)**  
  - **Incorrect**: Classic CAH (e.g., 21-hydroxylase deficiency) causes ambiguous genitalia in females due to excess androgens. Non-classic CAH typically does not cause primary amenorrhea or absent pubic/axillary hair.  
- **Option 3: Ectodermal Dysplasia**  
  - **Incorrect**: This condition causes hypohidrosis, sparse hair, and dental abnormalities but does not explain normal breast development or primary amenorrhea. Amenorrhea would require additional defects (e.g., Müllerian agenesis), which are not implied here.  
- **Option 4: Psychiatric Disorder**  
  - **Incorrect**: Psychosocial stress or eating disorders can delay puberty but would not explain normal breast development with absent androgenic signs (pubic/axillary hair).  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**  

Androgen insensitivity syndrome (Option 1) is the most likely diagnosis. The patient’s normal breast development (indicative of estrogen action) and absent pubic/axillary hair (indicative of androgen resistance) align with CAIS. In CAIS, individuals are genetically male (46,XY), have functional ovaries/testes, and develop breasts due to estrogen from aromatized testosterone, while androgen resistance explains the lack of secondary hair. The normal external genitalia and absence of menstrual periods further support this diagnosis.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question focuses on determining the cause of primary amenorrhea in a 17-year-old girl with normal female body habitus, breast development, and external genitalia but absent axillary/pubic hair. Key concepts include hormonal regulation of puberty, androgen sensitivity, and structural/genetic causes of amenorrhea.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Primary amenorrhea** requires evaluation of hormonal, anatomical, and genetic factors.  
- **Breast development** (thelarche) is estrogen-dependent, indicating functional ovaries.  
- **Pubic/axillary hair** (adrenarche) is androgen-dependent. Absence suggests androgen deficiency or resistance.  
- **Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS):** XY individuals with androgen receptor defects develop female external genitalia, normal breast development (due to aromatization of testosterone to estrogen), but lack pubic/axillary hair and have no uterus (causing amenorrhea).  
- **Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH):** Typically causes virilization in females due to excess androgens (e.g., 21-hydroxylase deficiency). Absent pubic hair contradicts this.  
- **Ectodermal dysplasia:** Affects ectodermal structures (hair, nails) but does not explain amenorrhea.  
- **Psychiatric disorders:** Hypothalamic dysfunction (e.g., anorexia) may cause amenorrhea but would not explain absent pubic hair or normal breast development.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Androgen insensitivity):** Matches the clinical picture. Normal breast development (estrogen activity), absent pubic/axillary hair (androgen resistance), and primary amenorrhea (absent uterus) align with complete AIS.  
- **Option 2 (Congenital adrenal hyperplasia):** Classic CAH causes virilization and excess hair, not absent hair. Rare forms (e.g., 17-hydroxylase deficiency) cause hypogonadism but would impair breast development.  
- **Option 3 (Ectodermal dysplasia):** Explains hair absence but not amenorrhea.  
- **Option 4 (Psychiatric disorder):** Does not account for absent pubic/axillary hair or normal breast development.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**  
The clinical presentation—normal breast development (estrogen-sufficient), absent pubic/axillary hair (androgen resistance), and primary amenorrhea (absent uterus)—is pathognomonic for complete androgen insensitivity syndrome. Other options fail to explain the combination of findings.
