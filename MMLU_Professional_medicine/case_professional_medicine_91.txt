问题: 
A randomized controlled trial is conducted to assess the effectiveness of a new combination-drug antihypertensive therapy (Drug X) compared with a standard antihypertensive single-drug therapy. Study participants include 140 women (70%) and 60 men (30%) ages 30 to 60 years, with baseline blood pressure measurements of 150/95 mm Hg or higher. The investigators defined antihypertensive therapy as effective if the treatment resulted in a blood pressure measurement below 140/90 mm Hg. When designing the study, the investigators set the probability of wrongly finding that Drug X is more effective than the standard therapy as 1%; they set the probability of wrongly finding that the effectiveness of the two drugs is the same as 10%. Which of the following is the most accurate estimate of the statistical power in this study?
选项: 
1. 1%
2. 10%
3. 40%
4. 90%

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question assesses the understanding of statistical power in the context of a randomized controlled trial comparing a new antihypertensive therapy (Drug X) with a standard therapy.
- It provides information about the study design, including sample size, participant demographics, baseline measurements, and outcome criteria.
- It specifically mentions the probabilities set by the investigators for wrong conclusions: a 1% chance of falsely claiming Drug X is more effective (Type I error) and a 10% chance of falsely concluding there is no difference between the drugs (Type II error).
- The question asks for the most accurate estimate of the statistical power of the study based on this information.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Statistical Power**: The probability that a study will detect an effect if there is an actual effect to be detected. It is calculated as 1 minus the probability of a Type II error (Power = 1 - β).
- **Type I Error (α)**: The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true (false positive). In this study, α is set at 1%.
- **Type II Error (β)**: The probability of failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false (false negative). In this study, β is set at 10%.
- **Clinical Significance**: Understanding statistical power is crucial in clinical trials to ensure that the study is adequately powered to detect meaningful differences between treatments.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1. 1%**
  - This represents the Type I error rate (α), not the power. Therefore, incorrect.
- **Option 2. 10%**
  - This represents the Type II error rate (β). Power is calculated as 1 - β, so this is not the correct estimate of power. Therefore, incorrect.
- **Option 3. 40%**
  - While possible in some studies, based on the given β of 10%, the power would be higher. Therefore, incorrect.
- **Option 4. 90%**
  - Power is calculated as 1 - β. Given that β is 10%, the power would be 90%. This aligns with standard statistical calculations for power. Therefore, correct.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks for the statistical power of a randomized controlled trial comparing a new antihypertensive therapy (Drug X) with a standard therapy. The key is to identify the statistical power based on the defined error probabilities (Type I and Type II errors).  

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Statistical Power**: Defined as the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis (i.e., detecting a true effect). It is calculated as **1 - β**, where β is the probability of a Type II error (failing to detect a true effect).  
- **Type I Error (α)**: The probability of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis (concluding Drug X is more effective when it is not). The question specifies this as 1% (α = 0.01).  
- **Type II Error (β)**: The probability of incorrectly failing to reject the null hypothesis (concluding no difference when there is one). The question specifies this as 10% (β = 0.10).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (1%)**: This represents the **Type I error rate (α)**, not the statistical power. Incorrect.  
- **Option 2 (10%)**: This represents the **Type II error rate (β)**, not the statistical power. Incorrect.  
- **Option 3 (40%)**: This value is not mentioned or implied in the question. Incorrect.  
- **Option 4 (90%)**: Calculated as **1 - β (1 - 0.10 = 0.90)**, which matches the question’s description of β = 10%. Correct.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  

Statistical power is defined as the probability of correctly detecting a true effect, calculated as **1 - β**. Since the question specifies the Type II error rate (β) as 10%, the power is **90%**. The other options incorrectly reference α (Type I error) or β directly, or an unrelated value.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks for the statistical power of a study based on predefined probabilities of Type I (α) and Type II (β) errors. Understanding the relationship between these errors and statistical power (1 - β) is critical.  

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Type I error (α)**: Probability of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis (here, set at 1% or 0.01).  
- **Type II error (β)**: Probability of failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false (here, set at 10% or 0.10).  
- **Statistical power**: Defined as 1 - β, representing the probability of correctly detecting a true effect.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (1%)**: Incorrect. This represents α (Type I error rate), not power.  
- **Option 2 (10%)**: Incorrect. This represents β (Type II error rate), not power.  
- **Option 3 (40%)**: Incorrect. No connection to the given parameters (α = 1%, β = 10%).  
- **Option 4 (90%)**: Correct. Power = 1 - β = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90 (90%).  

**4. Final Selection**  
The statistical power is directly derived from the pre-specified β (10%). Subtracting β from 1 gives 90%, aligning with Option 4.  

**My final selection is: Option 4**
