问题: 
A 5-year-old boy is admitted to the hospital because of a 1-week history of fever and increasingly severe abdominal discomfort. At the age of 7 months, he was treated for osteomyelitis caused by Aspergillus fumigatus. He has been admitted to the hospital three times during the past 4 years for severe pneumonia. He appears moderately ill. His temperature is 39°C (102.2°F). Abdominal examination shows an enlarged, tender liver. Ultrasonography of the abdomen shows an intrahepatic abscess. Culture of the abscess fluid grows Staphylococcus aureus. Further analysis shows failure of the neutrophils to undergo an oxidative burst when exposed to S. aureus. This patient has an increased susceptibility to infection as a result of which of the following abnormalities?
选项: 
1. Failure of leukocytes to migrate between endothelial cells
2. Failure of leukocytes to roll along the endothelial surface
3. Inability of leukocytes to ingest microorganisms
4. Inability of leukocytes to kill intracellular microorganisms

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question presents a 5-year-old boy with a history of recurrent severe infections, including osteomyelitis caused by *Aspergillus fumigatus* and severe pneumonia. Currently, he has an intrahepatic abscess cultured with *Staphylococcus aureus*. Laboratory findings indicate a failure of neutrophils to undergo an oxidative burst when exposed to *S. aureus*. The question asks which abnormality leads to his increased susceptibility to infections.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
The patient's recurrent and severe infections, especially with organisms like *S. aureus* and *Aspergillus*, suggest an underlying defect in the immune system, particularly in phagocyte function. The oxidative burst is a crucial mechanism by which neutrophils kill ingested pathogens, involving the production of reactive oxygen species via the NADPH oxidase complex. A failure in this process is characteristic of Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD), leading to an inability to effectively kill intracellular microorganisms after phagocytosis.

**3. Analysis of Options**  

1. **Failure of leukocytes to migrate between endothelial cells**  
   - This pertains to the diapedesis step of leukocyte extravasation. While important for immune response, it is not related to the oxidative burst mechanism.

2. **Failure of leukocytes to roll along the endothelial surface**  
   - This involves the initial rolling step mediated by selectins. This process is unrelated to the leukocytes' ability to kill pathogens after ingestion.

3. **Inability of leukocytes to ingest microorganisms**  
   - This refers to phagocytosis. The patient's issue is not with ingestion but with the subsequent killing of ingested pathogens.

4. **Inability of leukocytes to kill intracellular microorganisms**  
   - This directly relates to the oxidative burst mechanism. A defect here, as seen in CGD, aligns with the patient's failure to kill *S. aureus* effectively after phagocytosis.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question focuses on identifying the underlying immunodeficiency causing recurrent severe infections in a child. The key clinical and laboratory findings include a history of Aspergillus osteomyelitis, recurrent pneumonia, S. aureus liver abscess, and a defect in neutrophil oxidative burst. The question asks which abnormality explains the patient's increased susceptibility to infections.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Neutrophil Function**: Neutrophils are critical for fighting bacterial and fungal infections. Their antimicrobial activity involves several steps: chemotaxis, adhesion, phagocytosis, and intracellular killing via the respiratory (oxidative) burst.  
- **Oxidative Burst Defect**: A failure of the oxidative burst impairs the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are essential for killing phagocytosed pathogens. This defect leads to an inability to eradicate intracellular microbes despite normal phagocytosis.  
- **Clinical Correlation**: Recurrent infections with pyogenic organisms (e.g., S. aureus, Aspergillus) and abscess formation are hallmark features of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), a primary immunodeficiency caused by defects in the NADPH oxidase complex, which mediates the oxidative burst.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Failure of leukocytes to migrate between endothelial cells**  
   - This refers to defects in diapedesis, such as seen in leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD), which involves impaired integrin function. The question specifies a defect in oxidative burst, not migration, so this is **incorrect**.  

2. **Failure of leukocytes to roll along the endothelial surface**  
   - Rolling is mediated by selectins (e.g., E-selectin, P-selectin). Defects here (e.g., in congenital disorders of glycosylation) would impair early leukocyte-endothelium interaction. The oxidative burst is unrelated, so this is **incorrect**.  

3. **Inability of leukocytes to ingest microorganisms**  
   - This describes a phagocytosis defect (e.g., chronic neutropenia or Chediak-Higashi syndrome). However, the question states that oxidative burst failure occurs *after* exposure to S. aureus, implying phagocytosis is intact. Thus, this is **incorrect**.  

4. **Inability of leukocytes to kill intracellular microorganisms**  
   - The oxidative burst is required for intracellular killing. A defective oxidative burst directly prevents neutrophils from eliminating phagocytosed pathogens, leading to persistent infections. This aligns with the patient’s clinical and laboratory findings, making this **correct**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  

The patient’s defective neutrophil oxidative burst directly impairs the ability to kill intracellular pathogens after phagocytosis. This explains recurrent severe bacterial and fungal infections (e.g., S. aureus abscess, Aspergillus osteomyelitis) and is the hallmark of chronic granulomatous disease. The other options address defects in earlier steps of the immune response (migration, rolling, phagocytosis), which are not supported by the described defect in oxidative metabolism.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question assesses the underlying immune defect causing recurrent infections in a child with neutrophil oxidative burst failure. It requires understanding the steps in neutrophil function and correlating clinical findings with specific immunodeficiency disorders.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Neutrophil Function Steps**:  
  1. **Rolling** (selectin-mediated), **adhesion** (integrin-mediated), **migration** (transendothelial).  
  2. **Phagocytosis** (requires opsonization and receptors).  
  3. **Killing** via oxidative burst (NADPH oxidase generates ROS).  
- **Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD)**: Defective NADPH oxidase prevents oxidative burst, impairing killing of catalase-positive organisms (e.g., *S. aureus*, *Aspergillus*). Diagnosed by abnormal oxidative burst tests (e.g., NBT).  
- **Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency (LAD)**: Defects in migration (e.g., CD18 integrin deficiency in LAD I) cause impaired pus formation and recurrent infections without abscesses.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Migration failure)**: Incorrect. Impaired migration (e.g., LAD I) would prevent neutrophils from reaching infection sites, leading to absent pus. Here, abscess formation indicates successful migration.  
- **Option 2 (Rolling failure)**: Incorrect. Defective rolling (e.g., LAD II) causes recurrent infections but does not affect oxidative burst.  
- **Option 3 (Phagocytosis failure)**: Incorrect. Inability to ingest microbes would prevent pathogen internalization, but oxidative burst defects occur post-ingestion.  
- **Option 4 (Killing failure)**: Correct. Oxidative burst failure (CGD) allows ingested pathogens to survive intracellularly, causing recurrent abscesses and infections with catalase-positive organisms.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  
The patient’s history of *Aspergillus* osteomyelitis, *S. aureus* liver abscess, and oxidative burst failure align with CGD. This defect specifically impairs neutrophil killing of intracellular pathogens, making Option 4 the most accurate.
