问题: 
A 1-year-old male is brought to the emergency department with blistered fresh burns over his hands and feet in a stocking and glove distribution. His mother reports that he was accidentally burned when he turned on the hot water in the bathtub while she was answering the telephone in the bedroom. In addition to debridement of the burns, pain management, a thorough history and physical examination, and baseline laboratory studies, the most appropriate next step is to
选项: 
1. administer a 5% albumin infusion
2. administer intravenous steroids
3. contact child protective services
4. discharge the patient home with his parents

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question presents a clinical scenario involving a young child with specific burn patterns and asks for the most appropriate next step in management beyond standard medical care. The focus is on determining whether the burns are accidental or may suggest non-accidental injury (child abuse).

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Burn Patterns:** Burns in a "stocking and glove" distribution are atypical for accidental injuries, especially in young children. Such patterns can indicate forced immersion burns, a common sign of non-accidental trauma.
- **History Consistency:** The mother's explanation must be consistent with the clinical findings. Discrepancies between the reported mechanism and injury pattern raise suspicion for abuse.
- **Child Protection:** Healthcare providers have a duty to report suspected child abuse to appropriate authorities to ensure the safety of the child.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Administer a 5% albumin infusion:** This is not a standard treatment for burns unless there are specific indications such as hypoalbuminemia. It does not address the underlying concern of potential abuse.
2. **Administer intravenous steroids:** Steroids are not indicated for burn management and have no role in addressing suspected child abuse.
3. **Contact child protective services:** Given the suspicious burn pattern and potential for non-accidental injury, this is the appropriate action to ensure the child's safety.
4. **Discharge the patient home with his parents:** This would neglect the potential risk of ongoing abuse and fails to address the safety concerns raised by the injury pattern.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question involves evaluating a pediatric burn case with a specific anatomical distribution ("stocking and glove") and determining the most appropriate next step in management. Key considerations include assessing the mechanism of injury, potential for non-accidental trauma, and standard protocols for suspected child abuse.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Burn Pattern Analysis**: Burns in a stocking-and-glove distribution (symmetrical involvement of hands and feet) can occur in accidental injuries (e.g., splashing hot water), but they may also suggest intentional immersion in hot water, especially in young children.  
- **Mechanism of Injury**: A 1-year-old’s ability to independently turn on a hot water faucet is questionable, raising concerns about parental supervision or intentional harm.  
- **Child Abuse Considerations**: Immersion injuries often present with circumferential burns on extremities, sparing areas like the buttocks (doughnut-shaped pattern). However, asymmetrical or atypical distributions may still warrant suspicion.  
- **Standard Protocols**: In suspected abuse, contacting Child Protective Services (CPS) is mandatory to protect the child and investigate potential neglect or intentional harm.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (5% albumin infusion)**: Albumin is not first-line for burn resuscitation. Crystalloids (e.g., lactated Ringer’s) are preferred. Albumin may be considered in severe burns, but this is not the immediate next step here.  
- **Option 2 (IV steroids)**: Steroids are contraindicated in burn patients due to risks of immunosuppression, delayed healing, and increased mortality.  
- **Option 3 (Contact CPS)**: Mandatory when there is suspicion of non-accidental injury, especially with atypical burn patterns or inconsistent histories. The child’s age and the questionable mechanism warrant immediate CPS involvement.  
- **Option 4 (Discharge home)**: Inappropriate given the severity of burns (blistering, requiring debridement) and the need for further evaluation of the injury’s etiology.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  
The burns’ distribution and the questionable mechanism of injury (a 1-year-old independently turning on a hot faucet) necessitate a thorough investigation for non-accidental trauma. Contacting CPS is critical to ensure the child’s safety and comply with legal and ethical obligations. Other options are either contraindicated (steroids), unnecessary (albumin in this context), or premature (discharge).

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question involves a 1-year-old with burns in a "stocking and glove" distribution, a pattern suggestive of non-accidental trauma. The task is to determine the most appropriate next step in management after addressing immediate medical needs, with a focus on recognizing potential child abuse.  

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Burn Patterns**: Symmetrical burns involving hands/feet (stocking-glove distribution) are highly suspicious for intentional immersion in hot water. Accidental burns typically involve irregular patterns (e.g., splash burns).  
- **Developmental Milestones**: A 1-year-old lacks the motor skills to independently turn on a faucet and sustain such symmetrical burns.  
- **Child Abuse Evaluation**: Discrepancies between the reported history and injury pattern mandate suspicion of abuse. Medical providers are legally obligated to report suspected abuse to child protective services (CPS).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Albumin infusion)**: Incorrect. Albumin is used for fluid resuscitation in major burns (>20% body surface area). The question does not specify extensive burns requiring colloid therapy.  
- **Option 2 (IV steroids)**: Incorrect. Steroids are contraindicated in burns; they impair wound healing and increase infection risk.  
- **Option 3 (Contact CPS)**: Correct. The injury pattern and inconsistent history strongly suggest abuse, necessitating CPS involvement to ensure child safety.  
- **Option 4 (Discharge home)**: Incorrect. Discharging without further evaluation risks leaving the child in a harmful environment.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The injury pattern and developmental mismatch with the caregiver’s account indicate potential abuse. Mandatory reporting to CPS is critical.  

**My final selection is: Option 3**
