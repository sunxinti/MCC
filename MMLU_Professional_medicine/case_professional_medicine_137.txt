**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is assessing knowledge of psychological defense mechanisms in the context of adolescent behavioral changes following a significant family event (parents' separation). It requires identifying which defense mechanism best explains the patient's shift from exemplary behavior to rebellious and risky activities.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Defense Mechanisms**: These are unconscious psychological strategies used to cope with reality and maintain self-image. They are commonly discussed in psychoanalytic theory.
- **Acting Out**: Involves expressing unconscious emotional conflicts or feelings through actions rather than words, often in socially inappropriate ways.
- **Displacement**: Redirecting emotions or reactions from the original source to a safer or substitute target.
- **Projection**: Attributing one’s own unacceptable feelings or thoughts to others.
- **Reaction Formation**: Behaving in a way that is opposite to one’s true feelings or impulses, often to conceal them.
- **Adolescence and Stress**: Adolescents may use defense mechanisms to handle the stress of significant life changes, such as parental separation, which can lead to behavioral issues.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Acting out**  
  - The patient is engaging in risky sexual behavior, smoking, defiance, and rebellion, which can be seen as a way to express and manage underlying emotional distress due to her parents' separation.
  - This aligns with the concept of acting out, where internal conflicts are expressed through actions.
  
- **Option 2: Displacement**  
  - This involves shifting emotions from the real source to another object or person. While possible, the behaviors described seem more like direct expressions of inner turmoil rather than redirected emotions.
  
- **Option 3: Projection**  
  - Projection would involve the patient attributing her own feelings or thoughts to others, which is not explicitly indicated in the scenario.
  
- **Option 4: Reaction formation**  
  - This would involve behaving in a way that is directly opposite to her actual feelings. The patient was previously high-achieving, and her current behavior is a deviation, but it seems more about expressing distress than being the opposite of her true feelings.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks to identify the defense mechanism underlying the behavioral changes in a 14-year-old girl following her parents' separation. Her new behaviors include rebellion, defiance, risky sexual activity, smoking, and school truancy. The key is to match these manifestations to the listed defense mechanisms.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
Defense mechanisms are psychological strategies to cope with stress, anxiety, or internal/external conflict. The options provided are common defense mechanisms:  
- **Acting out**: Expressing unconscious conflicts or emotions through impulsive actions rather than verbal or reflective processing.  
- **Displacement**: Redirecting emotions (e.g., anger) from the original source (e.g., parents) to a safer target (e.g., peers, rules).  
- **Projection**: Attributing one’s own unacceptable feelings or impulses to others.  
- **Reaction formation**: Behaving in the opposite way of one’s true feelings (e.g., excessive affection masking hatred).  

The patient’s sudden rebellious and risk-taking behaviors directly correlate with unresolved emotional distress from her parents' separation. These actions are not redirected (displacement) or projected onto others (projection), nor are they the opposite of her true feelings (reaction formation).

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Acting out)**: Correct. The patient’s defiant, rebellious, and risk-taking behaviors (e.g., unsafe sex, smoking, truancy) are direct manifestations of inner turmoil and unresolved emotions. This aligns with acting out as a defense mechanism.  
- **Option 2 (Displacement)**: Incorrect. Displacement involves redirecting emotions to a substitute target. The patient’s defiance is not redirected but is a direct response to her stressor (parents’ separation).  
- **Option 3 (Projection)**: Incorrect. Projection involves attributing one’s own feelings to others. There is no evidence the patient is misattributing emotions to others.  
- **Option 4 (Reaction formation)**: Incorrect. Reaction formation involves behaving oppositely to one’s true feelings. The patient’s actions align with her inner distress, not the suppression of opposing emotions.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks to identify the defense mechanism used by a 14-year-old girl exhibiting risky and defiant behaviors (e.g., unprotected sex, truancy, smoking) following parental separation. Defense mechanisms are unconscious psychological strategies to manage stress or emotional conflict. The task requires distinguishing between mechanisms like acting out, displacement, projection, and reaction formation.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Acting out**: Expressing unresolved emotions through impulsive or destructive actions (e.g., defiance, substance use) to avoid confronting internal distress.  
- **Displacement**: Redirecting emotions from a threatening target to a safer one (e.g., anger at a parent directed toward a peer).  
- **Projection**: Attributing one’s unacceptable feelings/impulses to others (e.g., accusing others of hostility while denying one’s own).  
- **Reaction formation**: Adopting behaviors/attitudes opposite to one’s true feelings (e.g., excessive kindness masking resentment).  

The patient’s sudden engagement in high-risk behaviors (sexual activity, truancy) aligns with maladaptive coping to externalize emotional pain rather than internal reflection.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Acting out**  
  Correct. Her behaviors (defiance, unprotected sex, smoking) directly externalize distress from her parents’ separation without addressing the underlying emotional conflict.  
- **Option 2: Displacement**  
  Incorrect. No evidence of redirected emotions (e.g., anger toward a substitute target). Her actions target her own life/safety, not a displaced object.  
- **Option 3: Projection**  
  Incorrect. No indication she attributes her own feelings to others (e.g., blaming others for her actions).  
- **Option 4: Reaction formation**  
  Incorrect. Her rebellious actions reflect her true feelings (anger, sadness), not opposing behaviors (e.g., exaggerated compliance).  

**4. Final Selection**  
The patient’s behaviors exemplify **acting out**, as she externalizes unresolved emotional turmoil through destructive actions to avoid confronting her distress.  

**My final selection is: Option 1**
