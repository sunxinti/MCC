问题: 
A 10-year-old girl is brought to the office by her mother because her school nurse thinks that she may have Marfan syndrome. She is at the 95th percentile for height and 25th percentile for weight. Physical examination shows a narrow palate with dental crowding, long slender extremities, and joint laxity. Molecular testing for FBN1 shows a single nucleotide difference that does not change the amino acid at that locus. Her mother is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall. There is no clinical evidence of Marfan syndrome in the mother, but she has the same single nucleotide change as the patient. The same nucleotide change is found in 15 of 200 individuals without Marfan syndrome. Which of the following best describes the single nucleotide change in the patient and her mother?
选项: 
1. It is a disease-causing mutation in the patient and her mother
2. It is a polymorphism
3. It is a sequence variant of unknown significance
4. It will change the folding of the protein

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question presents a clinical scenario involving a 10-year-old girl suspected of having Marfan syndrome based on physical characteristics. Molecular testing reveals a single nucleotide change in the FBN1 gene that does not alter the amino acid sequence (a synonymous mutation). Her mother carries the same nucleotide change but shows no clinical signs of Marfan syndrome. Additionally, the same nucleotide change is found in 15 out of 200 individuals without the condition. The question asks for the best description of this single nucleotide change.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Marfan Syndrome:** A genetic disorder affecting connective tissue, primarily caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene.
- **FBN1 Gene:** Encodes fibrillin-1, essential for the structural integrity of connective tissues.
- **Synonymous Mutation:** A change in the DNA sequence that does not result in a change in the amino acid sequence of the protein. Often considered benign but can sometimes affect gene expression or splicing.
- **Polymorphism:** A genetic variation that is common in the population (typically >1%) and usually does not cause disease.
- **Sequence Variant of Unknown Significance (VUS):** A genetic alteration whose impact on disease risk is not clearly established.
- **Protein Folding:** Changes in amino acid sequence can affect protein structure and function, but synonymous mutations typically do not alter the amino acid sequence.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **It is a disease-causing mutation in the patient and her mother:**  
   - **Incorrect.** The variant is present in multiple healthy individuals and the mother shows no clinical signs, making it unlikely to be pathogenic.

2. **It is a polymorphism:**  
   - **Correct.** The variant is found in 7.5% of the control population (15/200), fitting the definition of a polymorphism, which is a common genetic variation not typically associated with disease.

3. **It is a sequence variant of unknown significance:**  
   - **Incorrect.** While synonymous mutations can sometimes be VUS, the presence of the variant in a significant portion of the healthy population suggests it is benign rather than of unknown significance.

4. **It will change the folding of the protein:**  
   - **Incorrect.** Since the mutation does not alter the amino acid sequence, it is unlikely to affect protein folding.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks about interpreting a genetic finding in a patient suspected of having Marfan syndrome. The key issue is determining the nature of a single nucleotide change in the FBN1 gene that does not alter the amino acid (silent mutation), given its presence in both the patient and her asymptomatic mother, as well as its frequency in unaffected individuals.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Marfan Syndrome**: Caused by pathogenic variants in the FBN1 gene, typically leading to fibrillin-1 protein dysfunction.  
- **Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP)**: A common genetic variant that does not change the amino acid (synonymous mutation) and is usually benign.  
- **Variant Interpretation**:  
  - Pathogenic variants are typically rare and associated with disease.  
  - Benign variants (polymorphisms) are common in the population and do not cause disease.  
  - Variants of unknown significance (VUS) lack sufficient evidence to classify as pathogenic or benign.  
- **Clinical Context**: The mother’s lack of symptoms and the variant’s presence in 7.5% of unaffected individuals suggest it is not pathogenic.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Incorrect. A pathogenic mutation would cause disease in carriers. The mother does not have Marfan syndrome, and the variant is common in the general population, ruling out pathogenicity.  
- **Option 2**: Correct. The variant is synonymous (no amino acid change), common in unaffected individuals (15/200), and does not correlate with disease. This fits the definition of a benign polymorphism.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. The evidence (frequency in controls and absence of disease in the mother) strongly suggests the variant is benign, so it is not a variant of unknown significance.  
- **Option 4**: Incorrect. Since the nucleotide change does not alter the amino acid, there is no basis to conclude it affects protein folding.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  

The variant is a polymorphism because it is a silent mutation (no amino acid change), present in 7.5% of unaffected individuals, and does not cause disease in the mother. This meets the criteria for a benign polymorphism rather than a pathogenic mutation or a variant of unknown significance.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks to determine the nature of a single nucleotide change in the *FBN1* gene found in a patient with suspected Marfan syndrome and her unaffected mother. Key considerations include genetic principles (e.g., mutations vs. polymorphisms), clinical relevance of the variant, and population data.  

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Marfan Syndrome**: Autosomal dominant disorder caused by pathogenic variants in *FBN1*. Clinical diagnosis requires systemic features (e.g., aortic root dilation, ectopia lentis, skeletal manifestations).  
- **Genetic Variants**:  
  - **Disease-causing mutations**: Alter protein function (e.g., missense, frameshift) and correlate with clinical disease.  
  - **Polymorphisms**: Common, benign genetic variations (>1% population frequency) not associated with disease.  
  - **Sequence variants of unknown significance (VUS)**: Variants lacking sufficient evidence to classify as pathogenic or benign.  
- **Silent Mutations**: Synonymous nucleotide changes that do not alter amino acids. Rarely pathogenic unless affecting splicing.  
- **Population Data**: A variant found in 7.5% (15/200) of unaffected individuals strongly suggests a polymorphism.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Disease-causing mutation)**: Incorrect. The variant does not alter the amino acid, is present in unaffected individuals (including the mother), and lacks segregation with disease. Autosomal dominant Marfan would require the mother to exhibit symptoms if the variant were pathogenic.  
- **Option 2 (Polymorphism)**: Correct. The variant is common in the general population (15/200) and does not correlate with clinical disease in the mother or population.  
- **Option 3 (VUS)**: Incorrect. Population and familial data (variant present in unaffected individuals) classify it as benign, not a VUS.  
- **Option 4 (Changes protein folding)**: Incorrect. Silent mutations do not alter the protein sequence. No evidence suggests splicing disruption or structural impact.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  
The single nucleotide change is a polymorphism. It is a benign, population-level variant with no evidence of pathogenicity, supported by its presence in unaffected individuals (including the mother) and lack of amino acid alteration. The patient’s features may reflect another etiology or overlap with Marfan-like phenotypes.
