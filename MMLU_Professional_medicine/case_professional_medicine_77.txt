**1. Question Analysis**  
The question presents a clinical scenario of a 29-year-old male experiencing psychological and somatic symptoms following a significant life change (relocating for a job promotion). The task is to determine the most accurate psychiatric diagnosis from the provided options based on his symptoms and recent life events.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
When diagnosing psychiatric conditions, it's essential to consider the context of symptom onset, duration, and relation to external stressors.  
- **Adjustment Disorder:** Develops in response to an identifiable stressor within three months of the onset of symptoms. Symptoms are clinically significant and cause marked distress or impairment in functioning.  
- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** Characterized by excessive anxiety and worry occurring more days than not for at least six months, about various domains.  
- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** Involves persistent sadness or loss of interest, along with other symptoms like changes in weight, sleep, and concentration, lasting at least two weeks.  
- **Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD):** A long-standing pattern of preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and control, which can impair flexibility and efficiency.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Adjustment Disorder with Anxious Mood:**  
   - **Correct.** The patient's symptoms emerged after a specific stressor (relocation and increased job responsibilities) within two months. The anxiety symptoms are significant and impact his functioning (e.g., calling in sick), aligning with this diagnosis.
2. **Generalized Anxiety Disorder:**  
   - **Incorrect.** GAD requires a minimum of six months of excessive anxiety and worry across multiple domains, not directly tied to a specific stressor.
3. **Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Moderate:**  
   - **Incorrect.** While the patient exhibits some symptoms like poor sleep and difficulty concentrating, the primary features are anxiety-related, and there's no mention of depressive symptoms such as persistent sadness or loss of interest.
4. **Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder:**  
   - **Incorrect.** OCPD is characterized by chronic patterns of perfectionism and control, not acute anxiety in response to a recent stressor.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question requires identifying the most likely psychiatric diagnosis for a patient presenting with anxiety symptoms (pounding heart, restlessness, poor sleep) and functional impairment (difficulty concentrating, calling in sick) triggered by a specific life stressor (relocation and increased job responsibilities). The key focus is differentiating between adjustment disorders, anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and personality disorders based on symptom duration, context, and diagnostic criteria.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Adjustment Disorder with Anxious Mood**: Symptoms develop within 3 months of a stressor, are maladaptive, and cause significant distress/impairment. Duration is typically <6 months unless stressor persists.  
- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)**: Chronic excessive anxiety about multiple topics for ≥6 months, with physical symptoms like restlessness or fatigue. No direct link to a specific stressor.  
- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)**: Requires depressed mood or anhedonia plus ≥4 other symptoms (e.g., sleep/appetite changes, fatigue) for ≥2 weeks. The patient’s primary symptoms here are anxiety-related, not depressive.  
- **Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD)**: Rigidity, perfectionism, and preoccupation with order/control. Symptoms are chronic and not stressor-specific.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Adjustment Disorder with Anxious Mood)**:  
  - **Support**: Symptoms began 2 months after relocation/promotion (stressor), duration <3 months, and include anxiety/restlessness. Impairment (calling in sick) aligns with maladaptive response.  
  - **Conclusion**: Likely correct.  

- **Option 2 (GAD)**:  
  - **Contradiction**: Requires ≥6 months of symptoms. The 2-month timeframe here is insufficient.  
  - **Conclusion**: Incorrect.  

- **Option 3 (MDD)**:  
  - **Contradiction**: Patient’s primary symptoms are anxiety/restlessness, not depressed mood or anhedonia. No mention of low mood or loss of interest.  
  - **Conclusion**: Incorrect.  

- **Option 4 (OCPD)**:  
  - **Contradiction**: OCPD involves longstanding personality traits (e.g., perfectionism, rigidity), not acute stressor-linked anxiety. Symptoms here are situational and time-limited.  
  - **Conclusion**: Incorrect.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**  

The patient’s symptoms (anxiety, restlessness, impaired functioning) emerged within 3 months of a specific stressor (relocation and job change) and do not meet criteria for chronic disorders like GAD or MDD. Adjustment disorder with anxious mood is the most accurate diagnosis given the temporal relationship to stress and symptom profile.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question assesses the ability to diagnose a psychiatric disorder characterized by anxiety symptoms and impaired functioning following a stressful life event (job promotion/relocation). Key elements include the **timing of symptom onset** (2 months post-stressor), **anxiety symptoms** (pounding heart, restlessness, insomnia, poor concentration), and **functional impairment** (absenteeism, difficulty adapting to responsibilities).

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Adjustment Disorder**: Symptoms arise within 3 months of a stressor, are disproportionate to its severity, and impair functioning. Symptoms resolve within 6 months of stressor termination.  
- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)**: Requires ≥6 months of pervasive, excessive worry about multiple domains, not tied to a specific stressor.  
- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)**: Requires ≥2 weeks of depressed mood or anhedonia, alongside neurovegetative symptoms (e.g., weight changes, suicidal ideation). Anxiety symptoms alone are insufficient.  
- **Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD)**: A chronic, inflexible pattern of perfectionism and control, not triggered by acute stressors.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Adjustment disorder with anxious mood**  
  Correct. Symptoms (anxiety, insomnia, impaired functioning) directly follow a stressor (relocation/promotion) and persist for 2 months. No evidence of chronic anxiety (as in GAD) or depressive criteria (as in MDD).  
- **Option 2: Generalized anxiety disorder**  
  Incorrect. GAD requires ≥6 months of generalized, non-specific worry. This patient’s anxiety is situational and acute, linked to a recent stressor.  
- **Option 3: Major depressive disorder**  
  Incorrect. No core depressive symptoms (e.g., depressed mood, anhedonia, guilt, or suicidal ideation). Anxiety is the primary complaint.  
- **Option 4: Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder**  
  Incorrect. OCPD involves lifelong maladaptive traits (e.g., rigid perfectionism), not acute stress-related symptoms.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**  
The patient’s symptoms align with **adjustment disorder with anxious mood**, as they occur within 3 months of a stressor, cause significant impairment, and lack features of GAD, MDD, or OCPD. The time-limited nature of symptoms and clear stressor linkage make this the most accurate diagnosis.
