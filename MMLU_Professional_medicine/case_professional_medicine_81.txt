问题: 
An investigator is studying the incidence of the common cold among medical students at various time points during the school year. Results show an increased incidence of upper respiratory tract infections among these students during finals week. It is hypothesized that the stress of studying for examinations adversely affects the immune system, making the students more susceptible to infection. Which of the following laboratory findings in these students during examination week is most likely to support this hypothesis?
选项: 
1. Decreased AM serum cortisol concentration
2. Decreased macrophage activity
3. Increased basophil count
4. Increased lymphocyte count

**1. Question Analysis**
- The question examines the relationship between psychological stress (specifically during finals week) and the immune system's ability to resist infections among medical students. It seeks to identify a laboratory finding that would support the hypothesis that stress impairs the immune system, increasing susceptibility to upper respiratory tract infections.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**
- **Stress and the Immune System**: Chronic stress activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, leading to increased production of cortisol, a glucocorticoid hormone.
- **Cortisol Effects**: Elevated cortisol levels can suppress various aspects of the immune system, including reducing the activity of immune cells like macrophages and lymphocytes.
- **Immune Cells**:
  - **Macrophages**: Innate immune cells responsible for phagocytosis and cytokine production; their activity can be suppressed by cortisol.
  - **Lymphocytes**: Part of the adaptive immune system; cortisol can lead to lymphopenia (reduced lymphocyte count).
  - **Basophils**: Involved in allergic responses; not directly linked to stress-induced immunosuppression.
- **Cortisol Levels**: Acute stress increases cortisol, but chronic stress may disrupt normal cortisol rhythms, though typically it is associated with elevated, not decreased, cortisol levels.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Decreased AM serum cortisol concentration**
   - **Incorrect**: Stress typically increases cortisol levels. A decrease would not support the hypothesis that stress is suppressing the immune system.
2. **Decreased macrophage activity**
   - **Correct**: Cortisol suppresses macrophage function, leading to diminished phagocytosis and cytokine production, which supports increased susceptibility to infections.
3. **Increased basophil count**
   - **Incorrect**: Basophil counts are not directly related to stress-induced immunosuppression and are more associated with allergic responses.
4. **Increased lymphocyte count**
   - **Incorrect**: Stress-induced cortisol typically decreases lymphocyte counts, not increases them.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question examines the relationship between psychological stress (during finals week) and immune function in medical students. It asks which laboratory finding would support the hypothesis that stress weakens immunity, increasing susceptibility to infections like the common cold.  

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Stress and Immunity**: Chronic or acute stress elevates cortisol levels, which suppresses immune function. Cortisol inhibits inflammatory responses and reduces the activity of immune cells (e.g., lymphocytes, macrophages).  
- **Immune System Components**:  
  - **Macrophages**: Key players in innate immunity; they phagocytose pathogens and activate other immune cells. Reduced activity would impair defense against infections.  
  - **Lymphocytes**: Decreased counts (lymphopenia) are typically seen with prolonged stress due to cortisol-induced redistribution or suppression of lymphocyte proliferation.  
  - **Basophils**: Involved in allergic responses; their count is not a primary marker of immune suppression.  
  - **Cortisol**: Elevated during stress, with peak levels in the morning (AM).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1. Decreased AM serum cortisol concentration**:  
  Stress typically increases cortisol, especially in the morning. Lower AM cortisol would contradict the expected stress response, making this **incorrect**.  

- **Option 2. Decreased macrophage activity**:  
  Cortisol suppresses macrophage phagocytic activity and cytokine production. Reduced macrophage function directly aligns with impaired immunity and increased infection risk, making this **correct**.  

- **Option 3. Increased basophil count**:  
  Basophils are not a primary marker of immune suppression. Stress-induced leukocytosis primarily involves neutrophils, not basophils. This is **incorrect**.  

- **Option 4. Increased lymphocyte count**:  
  Chronic stress typically causes lymphopenia (due to cortisol effects). Elevated lymphocytes would not support immune suppression, making this **incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  

Decreased macrophage activity directly supports the hypothesis that stress impairs immune function. Cortisol, elevated during stress, suppresses macrophage activity, reducing the body’s ability to combat infections like the common cold. This finding aligns with the proposed mechanism of stress-induced immune suppression.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question examines the link between stress-induced immune suppression and increased susceptibility to upper respiratory infections. The task is to identify a laboratory finding that supports the hypothesis that stress during exams weakens the immune system.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Stress and the HPA Axis**: Acute stress activates the HPA axis, increasing cortisol secretion. Cortisol has immunosuppressive effects, such as reducing inflammation and inhibiting immune cell activity.  
- **Immune Suppression Mechanisms**: Elevated cortisol decreases macrophage activity (phagocytosis, antigen presentation) and lymphocyte proliferation. Chronic stress may dysregulate cortisol levels, but acute stress typically raises them.  
- **Infection Susceptibility**: Reduced innate immune cell function (e.g., macrophages) increases vulnerability to pathogens like viruses causing the common cold.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Decreased AM serum cortisol concentration**  
  Incorrect. Acute stress (e.g., exams) should elevate cortisol, which suppresses immunity. Lower cortisol during stress contradicts expected physiological responses.  

- **Option 2: Decreased macrophage activity**  
  Correct. Cortisol and catecholamines released during stress directly inhibit macrophage functions (e.g., pathogen clearance, cytokine production), impairing innate immunity and increasing infection risk.  

- **Option 3: Increased basophil count**  
  Incorrect. Basophils mediate allergic responses and parasitic infections, not viral upper respiratory infections. Stress does not directly increase basophil counts in this context.  

- **Option 4: Increased lymphocyte count**  
  Incorrect. Acute stress may transiently redistribute lymphocytes, but chronic stress or high cortisol typically reduces lymphocyte proliferation and counts. Increased lymphocytes would not align with immunosuppression.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  
Decreased macrophage activity directly reflects stress-induced immunosuppression via cortisol and catecholamines, weakening innate defenses against pathogens. This finding supports the hypothesis that stress during exams compromises immune function, leading to higher infection rates.
