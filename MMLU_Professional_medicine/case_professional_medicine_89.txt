问题: 
A 15-year-old girl comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of acne. Breast and pubic hair development began at the age of 12 years. Menarche occurred at the age of 14 years. Physical examination shows scattered open and closed comedones over the cheeks and forehead. Breast and pubic hair development are Tanner stage 5. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's acne?
选项: 
1. Increased estrogen stimulation of the sebaceous glands
2. Increased responsiveness of the sebaceous glands to follicle-stimulating hormone
3. Increased sympathetic stimulation to the sebaceous glands
4. Stimulation of the sebaceous glands by androgens

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question presents a 15-year-old female patient with a 3-month history of acne. She has normal pubertal development, evidenced by Tanner stage 5 for breast and pubic hair, and her menarche occurred at age 14. The physical examination reveals scattered open and closed comedones on the cheeks and forehead. The question seeks to identify the most likely underlying cause of her acne from the given options.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Acne Pathophysiology:** Acne is primarily caused by increased sebum production, follicular hyperkeratinization, bacterial colonization (especially *Cutibacterium acnes*), and inflammation.  
- **Hormonal Influence:** Androgens play a crucial role in stimulating sebaceous glands to produce sebum. Elevated androgen levels or increased sensitivity of sebaceous glands to androgens can lead to acne.  
- **Puberty and Hormones:** During puberty, there is an increase in androgen levels, which contributes to the development of secondary sexual characteristics and can lead to acne.  
- **Tanner Staging:** Tanner stage 5 indicates full sexual maturity, suggesting that the patient's hormonal environment is mature and stable.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Increased estrogen stimulation of the sebaceous glands**  
   - *Incorrect.* Estrogens generally have a **reductive** effect on sebaceous gland activity and sebum production. They can help in reducing acne severity.  
2. **Increased responsiveness of the sebaceous glands to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)**  
   - *Incorrect.* FSH primarily regulates reproductive processes such as follicular development in ovaries and spermatogenesis in testes. It does not have a direct stimulatory effect on sebaceous glands related to acne.  
3. **Increased sympathetic stimulation to the sebaceous glands**  
   - *Incorrect.* While the sympathetic nervous system can influence various skin functions, it is not the primary mediator of sebum production related to acne.  
4. **Stimulation of the sebaceous glands by androgens**  
   - *Correct.* Androgens, such as testosterone, directly stimulate sebaceous glands to increase sebum production, which is a key factor in the development of acne.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks for the most likely underlying cause of acne in a 15-year-old girl with typical pubertal development. The key is to identify the hormonal mechanism driving sebaceous gland activity, as acne is primarily linked to hormonal influences on sebum production.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
Acne vulgaris is driven by androgenic stimulation of sebaceous glands, leading to increased sebum production and follicular plugging. During puberty, androgen levels rise, which is a major contributor to acne in adolescents. Estrogen, in contrast, tends to suppress sebaceous gland activity. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) primarily regulates ovarian follicular development and is not directly involved in sebaceous gland function. Sympathetic nervous system activity may influence sebaceous glands but is not a primary driver of acne in this context.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Increased estrogen stimulation of the sebaceous glands**  
  Incorrect. Estrogen inhibits sebaceous gland activity. Higher estrogen levels are associated with decreased sebum production, making this an unlikely cause of acne.  

- **Option 2: Increased responsiveness of the sebaceous glands to follicle-stimulating hormone**  
  Incorrect. FSH does not directly stimulate sebaceous glands. Its primary role is in ovarian follicle maturation, not sebum production.  

- **Option 3: Increased sympathetic stimulation to the sebaceous glands**  
  Incorrect. While stress (sympathetic activation) may exacerbate acne indirectly, it is not the primary underlying cause. The question focuses on hormonal mechanisms, not neurogenic factors.  

- **Option 4: Stimulation of the sebaceous glands by androgens**  
  Correct. Androgens (e.g., testosterone, dihydrotestosterone) are the primary hormonal drivers of sebaceous gland activity. During puberty, rising androgen levels lead to increased sebum production, which is a hallmark of acne vulgaris in adolescents.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks for the underlying hormonal cause of acne in a post-pubertal adolescent female. Key elements include the patient’s Tanner stage 5 development (indicating completion of puberty), normal menarche timing, and the presence of comedonal acne. The focus is on linking hormonal mechanisms to sebaceous gland activity.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Acne Pathophysiology**: Acne arises from androgen-driven sebum overproduction, follicular hyperkeratinization, bacterial proliferation, and inflammation.  
- **Hormonal Influence**: Androgens (e.g., testosterone, DHT) directly stimulate sebaceous glands to increase sebum production. This process is central to acne development during puberty.  
- **Tanner Stage 5**: Indicates full sexual maturity, with androgen levels stabilized but still active in maintaining sebaceous gland activity.  
- **Estrogen vs. Androgens**: Estrogen generally suppresses sebum production, while androgens enhance it.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Increased estrogen stimulation)**: Incorrect. Estrogen does not stimulate sebaceous glands; it may reduce sebum production. High estrogen states (e.g., pregnancy) often improve acne.  
- **Option 2 (FSH responsiveness)**: Incorrect. FSH primarily regulates ovarian follicles and estrogen synthesis. There is no established role for FSH in sebaceous gland stimulation.  
- **Option 3 (Sympathetic stimulation)**: Incorrect. Sympathetic nerves regulate stress responses, not sebum secretion. Sebaceous glands are hormonally, not neurally, controlled.  
- **Option 4 (Androgen stimulation)**: Correct. Androgens directly increase sebaceous gland size and sebum production, driving acne pathogenesis. This aligns with the patient’s post-pubertal status and acne presentation.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The patient’s acne is most likely due to androgen-mediated sebaceous gland activation, a hallmark of acne vulgaris in adolescents.  

**My final selection is: Option 4**
