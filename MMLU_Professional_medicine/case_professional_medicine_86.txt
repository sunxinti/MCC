**1. Question Analysis**

The question presents a clinical scenario of a healthy 4-year-old girl with specific heart murmur findings during a well-child examination. The key focus is to determine the most likely cardiac diagnosis based on the described auscultatory findings:
- Grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along the upper left sternal border.
- Widely split S2 that does not vary with respiration.
- Soft mid-diastolic murmur along the lower left sternal border.
- No other physical abnormalities.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**

- **Heart Murmurs in Pediatrics:** Understanding the timing, location, and quality of murmurs is essential for differential diagnosis. 
  - **Systolic Ejection Murmur:** Often associated with increased flow across semilunar valves or outflow tracts.
  - **Widely Split S2:** Suggests delayed pulmonic valve closure relative to the aortic valve. A fixed split that does not vary with respiration is particularly indicative.
  - **Mid-Diastolic Murmur:** May indicate increased flow across the tricuspid or mitral valves or the presence of an atrial septal defect.

- **Atrial Septal Defect (ASD):** A congenital heart defect characterized by a left-to-right shunt due to a hole in the atrial septum. Leads to increased right atrial and ventricular volume, causing a fixed splitting of S2 and a systolic ejection murmur due to increased flow across the pulmonic valve.

- **Differential Diagnoses:**
  - **Aortic Stenosis:** Typically presents with a systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border.
  - **Coarctation of the Aorta:** Often associated with upper extremity hypertension and decreased femoral pulses.
  - **Mitral Valve Prolapse:** Usually characterized by a mid-systolic click and possible late systolic murmur.

**3. Analysis of Options**

1. **Aortic Stenosis**
   - **Incorrect.** This condition usually presents with a systolic ejection murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border, often radiating to the neck. It is not typically associated with a fixed split S2 or a mid-diastolic murmur.

2. **Atrial Septal Defect**
   - **Correct.** ASD is characterized by a fixed splitting of S2 due to the continuous left-to-right shunt, leading to volume overload of the right heart chambers. The systolic ejection murmur results from increased flow across the pulmonic valve, and the mid-diastolic murmur can be due to increased flow across the tricuspid valve.

3. **Coarctation of the Aorta**
   - **Incorrect.** Coarctation presents with differential blood pressures between upper and lower extremities and characteristic murmurs in the back or left infraclavicular area, not typically with fixed splitting of S2.

4. **Mitral Valve Prolapse**
   - **Incorrect.** This condition is usually identified by a mid-systolic click and a possible late systolic murmur, not by a fixed split S2 or the described systolic ejection murmur.

**4. Final Selection**

**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question requires identifying the most likely congenital heart defect in a 4-year-old with specific cardiac findings: a systolic ejection murmur at the upper left sternal border, fixed splitting of S2, and a mid-diastolic murmur at the lower left sternal border.  

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Systolic Ejection Murmur (Grade 2/6, Upper Left Sternal Border):**  
  - This location corresponds to the pulmonary valve area. A soft ejection murmur here is often functional (e.g., increased pulmonary flow due to a left-to-right shunt).  
- **Fixed Splitting of S2:**  
  - Normally, S2 splitting varies with respiration (widely split during inspiration). Fixed splitting suggests prolonged right ventricular ejection time, commonly seen in atrial septal defect (ASD) due to continuous left-to-right shunting.  
- **Mid-Diastolic Murmur (Lower Left Sternal Border):**  
  - This corresponds to the mitral valve area. A mid-diastolic murmur here can arise from increased flow across the mitral valve (e.g., volume overload from left-to-right shunt in ASD).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Aortic Stenosis):**  
  - Aortic stenosis causes a harsh systolic ejection murmur at the *right upper sternal border*, not the left. Fixed splitting of S2 is not typical here. **Incorrect.**  
- **Option 2 (Atrial Septal Defect):**  
  - ASD is characterized by a left-to-right shunt, leading to increased pulmonary flow (soft systolic ejection murmur at the pulmonary area) and fixed splitting of S2. The mid-diastolic mitral murmur is due to increased flow across the mitral valve. **Most consistent with findings.**  
- **Option 3 (Coarctation of the Aorta):**  
  - Coarctation typically presents with a systolic ejection murmur in the suprasternal notch, upper back, or femoral arteries, along with blood pressure discrepancies. Fixed splitting of S2 is absent. **Incorrect.**  
- **Option 4 (Mitral Valve Prolapse):**  
  - Mitral valve prolapse causes a mid-systolic click and late systolic murmur, not a mid-diastolic murmur. Fixed splitting of S2 is unrelated. **Incorrect.**  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question assesses the ability to diagnose a congenital heart defect based on auscultatory findings in a pediatric patient. Key features include specific murmur characteristics (location, timing, intensity) and a fixed split S2.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Atrial Septal Defect (ASD):**  
  - **S2:** Fixed splitting (due to constant right ventricular volume overload, delaying pulmonary valve closure).  
  - **Murmurs:**  
    - Systolic ejection murmur at the upper left sternal border (pulmonary area) from increased pulmonary flow.  
    - Mid-diastolic murmur at the lower left sternal border (tricuspid area) from increased tricuspid valve flow.  
- **Other Conditions:**  
  - **Aortic stenosis:** Harsh systolic murmur at upper right sternal border; S2 may be single or paradoxically split.  
  - **Coarctation of the aorta:** Systolic murmur over the back/left infraclavicular area; hypertension in upper extremities.  
  - **Mitral valve prolapse:** Late systolic murmur ± click at the apex.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Aortic stenosis):** Incorrect. Murmur location (upper right sternal border) and S2 findings (no fixed split) do not match.  
- **Option 2 (Atrial septal defect):** Correct. Fixed split S2, pulmonary systolic murmur, and tricuspid diastolic murmur align with ASD.  
- **Option 3 (Coarctation of the aorta):** Incorrect. Exam lacks hypertension, radio-femoral delay, or characteristic murmurs.  
- **Option 4 (Mitral valve prolapse):** Incorrect. Murmur location (apex) and timing (late systolic) are inconsistent.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  
The fixed split S2, pulmonary systolic ejection murmur, and tricuspid diastolic murmur are pathognomonic for ASD. No other option explains all findings.
