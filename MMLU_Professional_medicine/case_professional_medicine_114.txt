问题: 
A 25-year-old woman who is 19 weeks pregnant comes to the office for a prenatal examination. Her father had classic hemophilia. A karyotype obtained from an amniotic fluid sample of the patient shows that the fetus is XY. Which of the following should you tell the patient regarding her infant?
选项: 
1. The infant will neither have hemophilia nor be a carrier
2. The infant has a 50% risk for hemophilia
3. The infant has a 50% risk for being a carrier
4. The infant has a 75% risk for hemophilia

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question assesses the genetic risk of hemophilia in a male fetus, considering the mother's carrier status. Specifically, it examines the probability that the infant will inherit hemophilia based on the genetic background of the parents and the fetal sex.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Hemophilia Genetics**: Hemophilia is typically an X-linked recessive disorder. Males (XY) with a defective X chromosome will express the disease, while females (XX) must inherit two defective X chromosomes to express the disease; otherwise, they are carriers.
- **Carrier Status**: A female carrier has one normal X chromosome and one mutated X chromosome (XᴴX). Each son has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutated X (resulting in hemophilia) and a 50% chance of inheriting the normal X.
- **Fetal Sex Determination**: The fetus is identified as male (XY), meaning he inherits the Y chromosome from the father and either the Xᴴ or X chromosome from the mother.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **The infant will neither have hemophilia nor be a carrier**  
   *Incorrect.* Since the fetus is male (XY) and the mother is a carrier (XᴴX), there is a 50% chance the infant inherits the mutated X chromosome, resulting in hemophilia.
   
2. **The infant has a 50% risk for hemophilia**  
   *Correct.* As a male fetus, there is a 50% chance he inherits the mutated X chromosome from his carrier mother, leading to hemophilia.
   
3. **The infant has a 50% risk for being a carrier**  
   *Incorrect.* Male infants cannot be carriers of X-linked recessive disorders; they are either affected or not, based on their single X chromosome.
   
4. **The infant has a 75% risk for hemophilia**  
   *Incorrect.* The risk is 50%, not 75%, based on the inheritance pattern of X-linked recessive traits in males.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question involves understanding X-linked recessive inheritance patterns, specifically for hemophilia.  
- The key points are:  
  - The patient’s father has classic hemophilia (an X-linked recessive disorder).  
  - The fetus is male (XY), so its X chromosome comes from the mother.  
  - The patient (mother) is a carrier if her father had hemophilia.  

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Hemophilia Inheritance**: Hemophilia A and B are X-linked recessive disorders.  
  - Affected males inherit the defective X chromosome from their mother.  
  - A father with hemophilia passes his X chromosome (defective) to all his daughters, making them carriers, but cannot pass it to his sons (since sons receive his Y chromosome).  
  - A carrier mother (heterozygous for the defective X) has a 50% chance of passing the defective X to each child. Sons who inherit the defective X will be affected; daughters will be carriers.  
- **Patient’s Carrier Status**: Since the patient’s father has hemophilia, she inherited his X chromosome, making her a carrier.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Incorrect. The infant (male) has a 50% chance of inheriting the defective X from the mother, so he could have hemophilia.  
- **Option 2**: Correct. The fetus has a 50% chance of inheriting the defective X chromosome from the mother, leading to hemophilia.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. Males cannot be carriers of X-linked recessive disorders; they are either affected or unaffected.  
- **Option 4**: Incorrect. A 75% risk would imply an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern with both parents contributing a defective allele, which is not the case here.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  
The infant is male and has a 50% chance of inheriting the defective X chromosome from the carrier mother, resulting in hemophilia. This aligns with X-linked recessive inheritance principles.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question assesses understanding of X-linked recessive inheritance (specifically Hemophilia A) in a prenatal scenario. Key elements include the patient’s father having hemophilia, the fetus being male (XY), and determining the infant’s risk for hemophilia or carrier status.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Hemophilia Inheritance**: Hemophilia A is X-linked recessive. Males (XY) inherit their X from the mother and Y from the father. A single defective X (Xᵉ) causes the disease.  
- **Patient’s Genetic Status**: The patient’s father has hemophilia (XᵉY), so the patient inherited his Xᵉ (obligate carrier: XᵉX).  
- **Fetal Risk**: As the fetus is male (XY), it inherits either the Xᵉ or normal X from the carrier mother. There is a 50% chance of inheriting Xᵉ (leading to hemophilia) or a normal X (unaffected).

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Incorrect. A 50% risk of hemophilia exists; "neither have nor be a carrier" applies only if the fetus inherited the normal X.  
- **Option 2**: Correct. The fetus has a 50% risk of inheriting Xᵉ from the carrier mother, resulting in hemophilia.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. Males cannot be carriers (carrier status applies to females with one Xᵉ).  
- **Option 4**: Incorrect. A 75% risk is inconsistent with X-linked recessive inheritance in this scenario.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The fetus, as a male, has a 50% chance of inheriting the Xᵉ allele from the carrier mother, directly leading to hemophilia. Carriers are female, so this terminology does not apply.  

**My final selection is: Option 2**
