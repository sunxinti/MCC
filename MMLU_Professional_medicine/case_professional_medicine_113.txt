问题: 
A 65-year-old man who is quadriplegic as a result of multiple sclerosis is hospitalized for treatment of left lower lobe pneumonia. His temperature is 38.1°C (100.5°F), pulse is 95/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. He appears malnourished. Rhonchi are heard at the left lower lobe of the lung on auscultation. Examination of the heart, lymph nodes, abdomen, and extremities shows no abnormalities. There is a 1-cm area of erythema over the sacrum with intact skin and no induration. Neurologic examination shows quadriparesis. Test of the stool for occult blood is negative. Which of the following is the most effective intervention for this patient's skin lesion?
选项: 
1. Frequent turning
2. Use of wet to dry dressings
3. Whirlpool therapy
4. Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question presents a clinical scenario involving a quadriplegic patient with multiple sclerosis hospitalized for pneumonia, who also has a 1-cm area of erythema over the sacrum. The focus is on determining the most effective intervention for the identified skin lesion, which appears to be an early-stage pressure ulcer.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Pressure Ulcers (Decubitus Ulcers):** These are injuries to skin and underlying tissue resulting from prolonged pressure, often over bony prominences. They are staged based on severity:
  - **Stage 1:** Non-blanchable erythema of intact skin.
  - **Stage 2:** Partial-thickness skin loss.
  - **Stage 3:** Full-thickness skin loss.
  - **Stage 4:** Full-thickness skin and tissue loss.
- **Risk Factors:** Immobility (e.g., quadriplegia), malnutrition, moisture, and friction.
- **Prevention and Treatment:** Frequent repositioning to alleviate pressure, maintaining skin hygiene, ensuring adequate nutrition, and using support surfaces.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Frequent turning**
   - **Correctness:** This is a primary preventive measure for pressure ulcers, especially in immobile patients. It redistributes pressure, reducing the risk of skin breakdown.
   - **Relevance:** Directly addresses the prevention and management of pressure-related skin lesions.
2. **Use of wet to dry dressings**
   - **Correctness:** Typically used for wound debridement in more advanced ulcers; not appropriate for an intact skin lesion without open wounds.
   - **Relevance:** Not suitable for Stage 1 ulcers.
3. **Whirlpool therapy**
   - **Correctness:** Used for certain musculoskeletal conditions; not indicated for pressure ulcer prevention or treatment.
   - **Relevance:** Irrelevant to the management of pressure ulcers.
4. **Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy**
   - **Correctness:** Indicated for infected wounds; the lesion has intact skin with no signs of infection.
   - **Relevance:** Unnecessary and inappropriate in this scenario.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question focuses on identifying the most effective intervention for a skin lesion in a quadriplegic patient with multiple sclerosis. The skin lesion is described as a 1-cm erythematous area over the sacrum with intact skin and no induration. The key considerations involve recognizing the type of skin lesion and determining the appropriate management strategy.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Skin Lesion Identification**: The description (erythema, intact skin, no induration) suggests a **Stage 1 pressure injury** (formerly pressure ulcer). This stage is characterized by non-blanchable erythema without skin breakdown.  
- **Quadriplegia and Immobility**: The patient’s immobility due to quadriplegia places them at high risk for pressure injuries, particularly over bony prominences like the sacrum.  
- **Management Principles**: For Stage 1 pressure injuries, the primary goal is **pressure relief** to prevent progression. Advanced interventions (e.g., debridement or antibiotics) are unnecessary at this stage.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Frequent turning)**:  
  **Correct**. Frequent repositioning (e.g., every 2 hours) is the cornerstone of managing Stage 1 pressure injuries. It alleviates pressure on the affected area, preventing further tissue damage.  
- **Option 2 (Wet-to-dry dressings)**:  
  **Incorrect**. Wet-to-dry dressings are used for debriding necrotic tissue in **Stage III or IV ulcers** with exposed tissue. They are unnecessary here because the skin is intact.  
- **Option 3 (Whirlpool therapy)**:  
  **Incorrect**. Whirlpool therapy is typically used for cleaning or managing **deep ulcers with necrosis**. It is not indicated for Stage 1 lesions.  
- **Option 4 (Broad-spectrum antibiotics)**:  
  **Incorrect**. Antibiotics are reserved for confirmed bacterial infections. There is no evidence of infection (e.g., induration, purulence, systemic signs) in this Stage 1 lesion.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**  

**Explanation**: The patient’s sacral erythema represents a Stage 1 pressure injury. The most effective intervention is **pressure relief via frequent turning**, which prevents progression to more severe stages. Other options address advanced wound care or infection, which are not applicable here.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks for the most effective intervention for a sacral skin lesion in a quadriplegic patient with pneumonia. The lesion is described as a 1-cm area of erythema with intact skin and no induration, consistent with a stage 1 pressure injury. The focus is on preventing progression and promoting healing through appropriate management.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Pressure injury staging**: Stage 1 involves non-blanchable erythema with intact skin. Management prioritizes pressure redistribution.  
- **Risk factors**: Quadriplegia, immobility, and malnutrition increase pressure injury risk.  
- **Intervention goals**: Offloading pressure, maintaining skin integrity, and avoiding interventions that could harm intact skin (e.g., excessive moisture, unnecessary antibiotics).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Frequent turning**  
  Correct. Repositioning every 2 hours is the cornerstone of pressure injury prevention and management. It reduces prolonged pressure on the sacrum, addressing the primary cause of the lesion.  
- **Option 2: Wet to dry dressings**  
  Incorrect. These are used for debriding necrotic tissue in open wounds. The skin here is intact, making this intervention unnecessary and potentially damaging.  
- **Option 3: Whirlpool therapy**  
  Incorrect. Typically used for wound cleansing in advanced stages (e.g., stage 3/4). Intact skin and early-stage injury do not require this, and prolonged moisture may cause maceration.  
- **Option 4: Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy**  
  Incorrect. No signs of infection (e.g., purulence, induration, fever localized to the lesion). Systemic antibiotics are unnecessary for stage 1 pressure injuries.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The most effective intervention is **frequent turning**, as it directly addresses the etiology of pressure injuries by redistributing pressure and preventing progression. Other options are either inappropriate for intact skin or lack evidence of benefit in this scenario.  

**My final selection is: Option 1**
