**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question requires interpreting the relative risk (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) from a cohort study to determine the effect of regular exercise on the risk of hip fractures in elderly women.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Relative Risk (RR):** RR of 1.2 indicates that those who exercise regularly have a 20% higher risk of hip fractures compared to those who do not exercise.
- **Confidence Interval (CI):** A 95% CI of 1.1 to 1.8 means we can be 95% confident that the true RR lies within this range. Since the CI does not include 1.0, the result is statistically significant.
- **Statistical Significance:** If the CI does not cross 1.0, the association is considered statistically significant, implying that the observed effect is unlikely due to chance.
- **Cohort Study Nature:** This observational study design can identify associations but cannot definitively establish causation.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1. Statistically nonsignificant increase in risk**
  - *Incorrect.* The CI (1.1 to 1.8) does not include 1.0, indicating the increase is statistically significant.
  
- **Option 2. Statistically nonsignificant overall decrease in risk**
  - *Incorrect.* The RR is greater than 1, indicating an increased risk, not a decrease. Additionally, the result is statistically significant.
  
- **Option 3. Statistically significant overall decrease in risk**
  - *Incorrect.* The RR suggests an increased risk, not a decrease.
  
- **Option 4. Statistically significant overall increase in risk**
  - *Correct.* The RR of 1.2 with a CI of 1.1 to 1.8 indicates a statistically significant increase in the risk of hip fractures among those who exercise regularly.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks about interpreting the results of a cohort study examining the association between regular exercise and hip fracture risk in elderly women. The focus is on understanding the meaning of a relative risk (RR) of 1.2 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.1 to 1.8.  

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Relative Risk (RR):** A measure of association between an exposure (regular exercise) and an outcome (hip fracture). An RR >1 indicates increased risk in the exposed group (those who exercise), while <1 indicates decreased risk.  
- **Confidence Interval (CI):** A range of values that likely contains the true effect. If the CI does not include 1, the association is statistically significant.  
- **Statistical Significance:** A result is statistically significant if the 95% CI excludes 1 for RR or odds ratios.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Statistically nonsignificant increase in risk**  
  - Incorrect. The 95% CI (1.1–1.8) does not include 1, meaning the association is statistically significant. The RR of 1.2 indicates an increase in risk, but the nonsignificant claim is false.  
- **Option 2: Statistically nonsignificant overall decrease in risk**  
  - Incorrect. The RR is >1 (1.2), indicating an increased risk, not a decrease. The nonsignificant claim is also incorrect because the CI excludes 1.  
- **Option 3: Statistically significant overall decrease in risk**  
  - Incorrect. The RR is >1, indicating an increased risk, not a decrease. Even if the CI excluded 1, the direction is wrong.  
- **Option 4: Statistically significant overall increase in risk**  
  - Correct. The RR of 1.2 indicates an increased risk, and the 95% CI (1.1–1.8) excludes 1, confirming statistical significance.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  
The relative risk of 1.2, with a 95% CI that does not include 1 (1.1–1.8), indicates a statistically significant increase in hip fracture risk among elderly women who exercise regularly. The direction of the RR (>1) confirms an increased risk, and the exclusion of 1 in the CI confirms statistical significance.

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question assesses the ability to interpret epidemiological study results, specifically a relative risk (RR) ratio and its 95% confidence interval (CI), to determine the statistical significance and direction of an association (here, regular exercise and hip fracture risk in elderly women).  

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Relative Risk (RR)**:  
  - RR = 1: No association.  
  - RR > 1: Increased risk in the exposed group (exercise group).  
  - RR < 1: Decreased risk in the exposed group.  
- **95% Confidence Interval (CI)**:  
  - If the CI does not include 1 (e.g., 1.1–1.8), the result is **statistically significant** (p < 0.05).  
  - If the CI includes 1 (e.g., 0.9–1.5), the result is **nonsignificant**.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: "Nonsignificant increase in risk" → Incorrect. The CI (1.1–1.8) excludes 1, indicating statistical significance.  
- **Option 2**: "Nonsignificant decrease in risk" → Incorrect. RR > 1 indicates increased risk, not a decrease.  
- **Option 3**: "Significant decrease in risk" → Incorrect. RR > 1 contradicts a decrease.  
- **Option 4**: "Significant increase in risk" → Correct. RR = 1.2 (>1) and CI excludes 1, confirming a statistically significant increase.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  
The RR of 1.2 (95% CI 1.1–1.8) demonstrates a statistically significant 20% increased risk of hip fractures among elderly women who exercise regularly. The CI excludes 1, confirming significance. Biological plausibility (e.g., exercise increasing fall risk in certain populations) is secondary to the statistical interpretation here.
