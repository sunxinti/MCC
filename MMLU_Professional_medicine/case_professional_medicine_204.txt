问题:

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question presents a clinical scenario involving a 14-year-old boy with acute onset of sore throat, fever, fatigue, and specific physical examination findings. The task is to determine the most likely diagnosis from the provided options based on the combination of symptoms and clinical signs.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Age and Demographics:** The patient is an adolescent male, which can influence the prevalence of certain infections.
- **Symptoms Duration:** Acute presentation (2 days) with progressive fatigue over a week.
- **Fever Pattern:** High fever peaking in the late afternoon.
- **Physical Examination Findings:**
  - Cervical lymphadenopathy
  - Pharyngeal erythema with a creamy exudate
- **Relevant History:** Recent initiation of unprotected sexual intercourse raises considerations for sexually transmitted infections, but the symptoms are more consistent with other diagnoses.

**Medical Concepts Involved:**
- **Infectious Mononucleosis:** Often caused by Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), presenting with sore throat, fever, fatigue, and lymphadenopathy.
- **Candidiasis:** Typically presents with white plaques in the oral cavity, not acute sore throat with systemic symptoms.
- **Herpangina:** Caused by Coxsackievirus, usually presents with vesicles or ulcers in the oropharynx, more common in younger children.
- **Mumps:** Characterized by parotid gland swelling, not primarily pharyngeal symptoms.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Candidiasis:**  
   - *Incorrect.* Candidiasis presents with white plaques or lesions in the oral mucosa without acute systemic symptoms like high fever and fatigue.
  
2. **Herpangina:**  
   - *Incorrect.* While it causes sore throat and pharyngeal lesions, it is more common in younger children and typically presents with vesicles or ulcers rather than a creamy exudate.
  
3. **Infectious Mononucleosis:**  
   - *Correct.* This condition matches the presentation of sore throat with exudate, high fever, cervical lymphadenopathy, and significant fatigue. It is common in adolescents and young adults.
  
4. **Mumps:**  
   - *Incorrect.* Mumps primarily presents with parotid gland swelling and does not typically involve pharyngeal exudate or the combination of symptoms described.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question requires identifying the most likely diagnosis for a 14-year-old male presenting with fever, sore throat, cervical lymphadenopathy, pharyngeal erythema with creamy exudate, and recent unprotected sexual intercourse. Key considerations include the clinical presentation, epidemiology, and differential diagnoses of infectious diseases in adolescents.  

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Infectious Mononucleosis (IM):** Caused by Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), IM is characterized by fever, pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy (especially cervical), and fatigue. The pharyngitis often has a creamy exudate, mimicking streptococcal pharyngitis. EBV spreads via saliva ("kissing disease"), and adolescents are a common age group.  
- **Candidiasis:** Typically presents with white plaques on the oropharynx, often in immunocompromised patients, and does not cause cervical lymphadenopathy or high fever.  
- **Herpangina:** Caused by coxsackievirus, presenting with vesicles/ulcers in the oropharynx, fever, and tender cervical lymphadenopathy. However, creamy exudate is not typical.  
- **Mumps:** Primarily causes parotid gland swelling, fever, and orchitis in postpubertal males. Cervical lymphadenopathy can occur, but the absence of parotitis and presence of creamy pharyngeal exudate make it less likely.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Candidiasis):** Unlikely. Candidiasis presents with white plaques, not creamy exudate, and lacks systemic symptoms like lymphadenopathy and high fever.  
- **Option 2 (Herpangina):** Less likely. Herpangina causes vesicles/ulcers, not creamy exudate, and is more common in younger children.  
- **Option 3 (Infectious Mononucleosis):** Most likely. The combination of fever, pharyngitis with exudate, cervical lymphadenopathy, and prolonged fatigue aligns with IM. EBV transmission via saliva (e.g., kissing during unprotected intercourse) is plausible.  
- **Option 4 (Mumps):** Unlikely. Mumps is defined by parotid swelling, which is not mentioned. The pharyngeal exudate is atypical for mumps.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question involves diagnosing a febrile adolescent with sore throat, fatigue, lymphadenopathy, and pharyngeal exudate. Key elements include differentiating infections based on clinical features, epidemiology (e.g., sexual activity), and laboratory findings.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Infectious mononucleosis (IM):** Caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), classically presents with fever, exudative pharyngitis, cervical lymphadenopathy (often posterior), and fatigue. Adolescents are high-risk due to behaviors like kissing. Fatigue may precede acute symptoms.  
- **Candidiasis:** Oral thrush presents as white, adherent plaques, typically in immunocompromised patients. Acute febrile illness with lymphadenopathy is atypical.  
- **Herpangina:** Caused by enteroviruses (e.g., coxsackievirus), features discrete oral vesicles/ulcers on the soft palate and posterior pharynx, not creamy exudates.  
- **Mumps:** Parotitis is pathognomonic; pharyngeal exudate and cervical lymphadenopathy are not typical.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Candidiasis):** Incorrect. Creamy exudate may mimic thrush, but candidiasis lacks fever, lymphadenopathy, and acute systemic symptoms in immunocompetent hosts.  
- **Option 2 (Herpangina):** Incorrect. Vesicular lesions, not exudates, are characteristic. Fever peaks earlier, and fatigue is less prominent.  
- **Option 3 (Infectious mononucleosis):** Correct. Exudative pharyngitis, cervical lymphadenopathy, prolonged fatigue, and adolescent age align with IM. Sexual activity increases EBV exposure risk.  
- **Option 4 (Mumps):** Incorrect. Absence of parotitis or submandibular gland swelling rules this out.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  
Infectious mononucleosis best explains the clinical triad (fever, exudative pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy), progressive fatigue, and the patient’s age/sexual history. EBV transmission via saliva aligns with recent sexual activity. Other options lack key features (e.g., parotitis in mumps, vesicles in herpangina).
