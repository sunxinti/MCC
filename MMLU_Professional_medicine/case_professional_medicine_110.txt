**1. Question Analysis**  
The question presents a 4-year-old boy with prolonged fever (8 days) accompanied by anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, nonexudative conjunctivitis, strawberry tongue, erythematous truncal rash, and edema of the hands and feet. It asks for the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to prevent complications of this illness.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
The clinical presentation is highly suggestive of Kawasaki disease, a vasculitis predominantly affecting children. Key features supporting this diagnosis include prolonged fever, bilateral nonexudative conjunctivitis, strawberry tongue, truncal rash, and peripheral extremity changes (edema or erythema). The primary complication of Kawasaki disease is the development of coronary artery aneurysms, which can lead to significant cardiac morbidity. The standard treatment to prevent such complications involves high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and aspirin therapy.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG):**  
   - **Correct.** IVIG is the standard treatment for Kawasaki disease to reduce the risk of coronary artery aneurysms.
2. **Intravenous penicillin:**  
   - **Incorrect.** Penicillin is an antibiotic used for bacterial infections and has no role in treating Kawasaki disease.
3. **Intravenous prednisone:**  
   - **Incorrect.** While corticosteroids may be considered in refractory Kawasaki disease cases, they are not first-line for preventing complications.
4. **Oral isoniazid:**  
   - **Incorrect.** Isoniazid is used for tuberculosis prophylaxis and treatment, which is unrelated to the presented condition.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question involves diagnosing a pediatric condition based on clinical features and identifying the appropriate treatment to prevent complications. The key focus is on recognizing the disease and its evidence-based management.  

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Diagnosis**: The clinical presentation (prolonged fever, cervical lymphadenopathy, nonexudative conjunctivitis, strawberry tongue, truncal rash, and hand/foot edema) strongly suggests **Kawasaki disease**, a vasculitis primarily affecting medium-sized arteries, particularly the coronary arteries.  
- **Complications**: The most serious complication of Kawasaki disease is **coronary artery aneurysm**, which can lead to ischemic heart disease or myocardial infarction.  
- **Treatment**: The cornerstone therapy for Kawasaki disease to prevent coronary artery damage is **intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)** combined with aspirin. Early treatment (within 10 days of illness onset) is critical.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Intravenous immune globulin)**: Correct. IVIG (2 g/kg) is the definitive treatment to reduce inflammation and prevent coronary artery complications.  
- **Option 2 (Intravenous penicillin)**: Incorrect. Penicillin treats bacterial infections (e.g., streptococcal pharyngitis), but Kawasaki disease is not bacterial. Antibiotics do not prevent coronary complications.  
- **Option 3 (Intravenous prednisone)**: Incorrect. While steroids may be used in refractory cases or as adjunct therapy in some protocols, they are not first-line for preventing complications. Monotherapy with steroids is ineffective.  
- **Option 4 (Oral isoniazid)**: Incorrect. Isoniazid treats tuberculosis, which is unrelated to Kawasaki disease.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**  
- Kawasaki disease is the most likely diagnosis, and IVIG is the gold-standard therapy to prevent coronary artery aneurysms. The other options are unrelated to treating or preventing complications of this condition.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question involves identifying the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for a child with symptoms consistent with Kawasaki disease (KD) to prevent complications, particularly coronary artery abnormalities. Key clinical features include prolonged fever, mucocutaneous involvement (strawberry tongue, rash), conjunctivitis, lymphadenopathy, and extremity edema.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Kawasaki Disease**: A systemic vasculitis primarily affecting medium-sized arteries, especially coronary arteries. Early treatment reduces coronary aneurysm risk.  
- **Diagnostic Criteria**: Fever ≥5 days + ≥4 of: (1) bilateral nonexudative conjunctivitis, (2) oral changes (e.g., strawberry tongue), (3) rash, (4) extremity changes (edema/erythema), (5) cervical lymphadenopathy.  
- **Treatment Goals**: Reduce inflammation and prevent coronary artery complications.  
- **First-line Therapy**: High-dose **intravenous immune globulin (IVIG)** + aspirin. IVIG reduces coronary aneurysm risk by 80% when administered within 10 days of fever onset.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (IVIG)**: Correct. IVIG is the cornerstone therapy for KD, significantly lowering coronary artery aneurysm risk.  
- **Option 2 (IV Penicillin)**: Incorrect. Penicillin targets streptococcal infections (e.g., scarlet fever), which may mimic KD but lack features like extremity edema and conjunctivitis.  
- **Option 3 (IV Prednisone)**: Incorrect. Steroids are not first-line; they are reserved for refractory cases or adjunctive therapy in specific protocols.  
- **Option 4 (Oral Isoniazid)**: Incorrect. Isoniazid treats tuberculosis, which is unrelated to this presentation.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The definitive treatment to prevent coronary complications in Kawasaki disease is **IVIG**. Other options address unrelated conditions or are not first-line therapies.  

**My final selection is: Option 1**
