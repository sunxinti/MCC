================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**
- The question presents a clinical scenario where a 13-month-old child experiences an acute hypersensitivity reaction (urticaria, lip swelling, difficulty breathing) immediately after consuming an egg. It then asks which vaccine poses a potential risk for a similar hypersensitivity reaction, considering the child’s apparent egg allergy.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**
- **Egg Allergy and Vaccines**: Certain vaccines are produced using egg-based methods, which can retain trace amounts of egg proteins and potentially trigger allergic reactions in sensitive individuals.
- **Vaccines and Egg-Based Production**:
  - **Influenza Vaccine**: Traditionally produced using embryonated chicken eggs, making them a concern for individuals with egg allergies. However, egg-free versions are now available.
  - **Hepatitis, Pertussis, and Poliomyelitis Vaccines**: These are generally produced using cell cultures or recombinant DNA technology, not relying on egg-based production, thus posing minimal risk for egg-allergic individuals.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Hepatitis**: Hepatitis B vaccines are typically recombinant and do not require egg-based production. **Incorrect**
2. **Influenza**: Traditionally produced in embryonated chicken eggs, which can contain residual egg proteins, posing a risk for individuals with egg allergies. **Correct**
3. **Pertussis**: Part of the DTaP vaccine, produced using bacterial cultures without egg involvement. **Incorrect**
4. **Poliomyelitis**: Inactivated polio vaccines are produced using cell cultures, not eggs. **Incorrect**

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 2**

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks which vaccine poses a potential risk of hypersensitivity in a child with an immediate allergic reaction to eggs. The symptoms (urticaria, lip swelling, difficulty breathing) suggest an IgE-mediated anaphylactic reaction, likely due to egg protein exposure. The key is identifying which vaccine is produced using eggs, thus containing trace egg proteins that could trigger an allergic reaction.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Egg Allergy and Vaccines**: Certain vaccines are grown in chicken egg embryos, leading to trace ovalbumin (egg protein) contamination. Individuals with severe egg allergies may have hypersensitivity reactions to these vaccines.  
- **Vaccines Grown in Eggs**: Influenza vaccines are primarily produced in chicken eggs, though current guidelines now permit administration even in egg-allergic individuals due to low residual protein. Other vaccines like MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) also use egg-based culture but are not listed here.  
- **Non-Egg-Based Vaccines**: Hepatitis (recombinant or cell-culture based), Pertussis (acellular, purified components), and Polio (Vero cell culture or oral, live attenuated) do not involve egg proteins in their production.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Hepatitis)**: Hepatitis vaccines (A and B) are produced using yeast or mammalian cell cultures, not eggs. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 2 (Influenza)**: Influenza vaccines are traditionally grown in chicken eggs, leaving trace egg proteins. This poses a theoretical risk for severe egg-allergic individuals, making it the correct answer. **Correct**.  
- **Option 3 (Pertussis)**: Acellular pertussis vaccines use purified bacterial components and no egg-based production. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 4 (Poliomyelitis)**: Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) is grown in Vero (monkey kidney) cells, and oral polio vaccine (OPV) uses HeLa cells. Neither involves eggs. **Incorrect**.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  
The influenza vaccine is produced using chicken eggs, leading to trace egg protein contamination. This poses a potential hypersensitivity risk in individuals with egg allergies, aligning with the child’s presentation. Other options are not associated with egg-based production.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question links an egg allergy (manifesting as urticaria, angioedema, and respiratory distress) to potential hypersensitivity risks from vaccines.  
- Focus: Identify which vaccine contains egg-derived components that could trigger an allergic reaction in a child with a history of egg-induced anaphylaxis.  

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Egg protein in vaccines**: Some vaccines are cultured in chicken embryos or contain egg-derived components (e.g., ovalbumin).  
- **Hypersensitivity risk**: Patients with severe egg allergies (e.g., anaphylaxis) may react to vaccines containing residual egg proteins.  
- **Vaccine-specific components**:  
  - **Influenza vaccine**: Historically produced in chicken eggs, potentially containing trace ovalbumin. Current guidelines note that most influenza vaccines (e.g., inactivated) have negligible egg protein and are safe for mild egg allergies, but caution remains for severe reactions.  
  - **Other vaccines**: Hepatitis B (yeast-based), pertussis (bacterial components), and polio (IPV: cell culture-derived; no egg) typically lack egg proteins.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Hepatitis)**: Hepatitis B vaccine uses yeast for production, not eggs. No egg-related risk. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 2 (Influenza)**: Traditional egg-based production may leave trace ovalbumin. While most egg-allergic patients tolerate it, severe anaphylaxis to egg warrants precaution. **Correct**.  
- **Option 3 (Pertussis)**: Pertussis vaccines (DTaP/Tdap) contain bacterial antigens, not egg-derived components. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 4 (Poliomyelitis)**: IPV is cultured in human cell lines, not eggs. Oral polio vaccine (OPV) uses monkey kidney cells; neither contains egg proteins. **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
- **Influenza vaccine** is the only option with a documented (albeit low) risk of egg protein content, making it the most relevant consideration for hypersensitivity in this patient.  

**My final selection is: Option 2**
