**1. Question Analysis**  
The question assesses the physiological changes during intense exercise, specifically identifying which cardiovascular parameter is most likely to decrease compared to the pre-exercise state in young men during the final minute of a treadmill session.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Heart Rate and Cardiac Output:** During exercise, heart rate increases significantly to meet the body's heightened demand for oxygen and nutrients. Cardiac output (heart rate × stroke volume) typically increases.
- **Stroke Volume:** In young, healthy individuals, stroke volume may increase slightly or remain relatively unchanged during moderate to intense exercise due to enhanced heart contractility and venous return.
- **Blood Pressure:** Systolic blood pressure generally rises or remains relatively stable during exercise, while diastolic pressure may decrease or remain unchanged.
- **Total Peripheral Resistance (TPR):** TPR usually decreases during exercise because of vasodilation in the muscles being exercised, which reduces resistance in the peripheral vasculature.
- **Pulse Pressure:** This is the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure. It might not significantly decrease as systolic pressure may rise while diastolic pressure may lower or stay the same.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Pulse pressure:** Typically remains the same or may slightly increase due to increased systolic blood pressure and decreased or stable diastolic pressure. Not the most likely to decrease.
2. **Stroke volume:** Likely remains the same or increases slightly with enhanced contractility and venous return during exercise. Not likely to decrease.
3. **Systolic blood pressure:** Generally increases or remains stable during exercise due to elevated cardiac output. Not likely to decrease.
4. **Total peripheral resistance:** Decreases significantly during exercise due to vasodilation in active muscles, reducing vascular resistance.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

Okay, let's tackle this question. Alright, so the question is about a clinical study where men aged 20-30 are on a treadmill for 15 minutes. The average pulse in the last two minutes is 175/min. Then, during the last minute, they take measurements. We need to figure out which of the four options is most likely decreased compared to before the session.

First, I need to recall what each of these terms means and how they relate to exercise physiology. Let's start with the question analysis. The key here is understanding how the body's cardiovascular system responds to intense exercise, especially during the last minute when the heart rate is high (175 bpm). The question is asking which parameter would be decreased compared to pre-exercise.

Moving to the key considerations. During intense exercise, the body's demands for oxygen and nutrients increase. The heart responds by increasing both heart rate and stroke volume to boost cardiac output. Cardiac output (CO) is heart rate (HR) multiplied by stroke volume (SV). So CO = HR x SV. Since the pulse is 175, which is quite high, HR is definitely up. But what about SV?

In the initial stages of exercise, stroke volume increases due to increased venous return and contractility. However, at very high heart rates, like 175, the heart might not have enough time to fill properly between beats. This is because the diastolic filling time (the time the heart spends relaxing and filling) decreases as heart rate increases. If the heart isn't filling as much, stroke volume might actually start to decrease because the ventricles don't have enough time to fill. So even though HR is up, SV might plateau or even drop a bit at very high heart rates. 

Now, looking at the options:

1. Pulse pressure: Pulse pressure is systolic minus diastolic. During exercise, systolic BP usually increases because the heart is pumping harder, and the arteries are more compliant. Diastolic BP might not increase as much or could even decrease because the vessels dilate (especially in non-active organs like the gut, but in muscles, they constrict). Wait, actually during exercise, systemic vascular resistance (TPR) might decrease in some areas but increase in others. Hmm, maybe total peripheral resistance (TPR) overall? Let me think again. 

Wait, total peripheral resistance (option 4) typically decreases during exercise because blood is redistributed. The skeletal muscles need more blood, so their arterioles dilate, lowering TPR. So TPR might decrease, which would mean that option 4 (Total peripheral resistance) is decreased. But let me check the other options.

2. Stroke volume (option 2): Earlier thought was that at very high HR, SV might decrease. But maybe during moderate exercise SV increases. At 175, which is quite high, maybe SV starts to drop. But I'm not sure if it's definitely decreased. Let's see.

3. Systolic BP (option3): During exercise, systolic BP usually rises because of increased cardiac output and some vasoconstriction in non-essential areas. So systolic BP would likely be higher, so not decreased.

4. TPR (option4): As I thought, TPR decreases because of vasodilation in active muscles, so TPR would be lower. So that would be a decrease.

Wait, the question is which is "most likely to be decreased" compared to before. Let's see:

Pulse pressure (option1): If systolic is up and diastolic is down, then pulse pressure would increase. So that's not decreased.

Stroke volume (option2): If SV is decreased, then that's a possible answer. But is that the case here? Let's think: during intense exercise, the body tries to maximize cardiac output. Initially, SV increases, but when HR is so high that diastolic filling time is too short, SV may plateau or even decrease. So at 175 bpm, which is quite high for a 20-30 year old (max HR is around 200, so 175 is high but not impossible), the SV might start to decrease. So stroke volume could be decreased. 

Wait, but the question is comparing during the last minute of exercise to before the session. So before, the resting SV is lower, but during exercise, even if SV is lower than peak, maybe it's still higher than resting? Hmm, that complicates things. Wait, no. Wait, if the subject is in the last minute of a 15-minute treadmill session, their body has been exercising for a while. Their stroke volume might have peaked earlier and now, at 175 bpm, maybe it's starting to drop. But compared to before the session (resting), even if it's slightly lower than peak, it's still higher than resting. Therefore, stroke volume would not be decreased compared to before. 

Wait, but the question says "compared with the measurement before the session". So if during the last minute, SV is lower than resting, then that's the case. But I don't think that's correct. Because during exercise, even at high HR, the SV is usually maintained or even increased through other mechanisms like increased contractility and more EDV (end-diastolic volume) from increased venous return. But when HR is so high that the diastolic filling time is insufficient, the EDV would not be maintained, leading to decreased SV. So if during the last minute, the SV is lower than before the session (resting), then option 2 would be correct. But is that the case?

Alternatively, maybe the stroke volume is still higher than resting, but the question is which is "most likely to be decreased". So if TPR is definitely decreased, then that's a better answer. Let me check the TPR again. 

Total peripheral resistance: During exercise, the body increases blood flow to muscles by vasodilation (reducing resistance) in skeletal muscle arterioles. At the same time, other areas like the skin and digestive organs may also vasodilate, contributing to lower TPR. So overall TPR would decrease, making option4 correct. 

Wait, but what about pulse pressure? Let me think again. Systolic pressure increases because of higher cardiac output and maybe some constriction in non-muscle areas. Diastolic pressure might not increase as much because of the vasodilation. So pulse pressure (systolic - diastolic) would increase. So option1 is not decreased.

Systolic BP (option3) is increased, so that's not decreased. 

Stroke volume (option2): If during the last minute, the SV is lower than at the start of exercise but higher than resting, then compared to before (resting), it's still increased. So unless SV is actually lower than resting, which I don't think is the case here, then option2 is not the answer.

So that leaves option4 (TPR) as the one that's decreased. 

Wait, but what about the other options? Let me check again. 

Another angle: Cardiac output (CO) is HR x SV. Since HR is up, but if SV is maintained or slightly down, but overall CO is still up. TPR is CO x (MAP / CO)? Wait, MAP is roughly (2*diastolic + systolic)/3. But TPR is (MAP - CVP)/CO. Assuming CVP is negligible, TPR is MAP/CO. If MAP increases (since systolic is up, diastolic maybe not), but CO increases more, then TPR might decrease. 

Alternatively, since TPR is calculated as (Mean Arterial Pressure)/(Cardiac Output), if MAP increases but CO increases more, TPR would decrease. 

So yes, TPR would decrease. 

Therefore, the correct answer is option4, total peripheral resistance. 

Wait, but I thought maybe stroke volume is decreased. But if the question is comparing to before the session (resting), then SV during exercise is higher than resting. Unless at very high HR, SV is lower than resting? That's unlikely. So TPR must be the answer. 

Alternatively, maybe pulse pressure. Wait, let's see. 

Wait, let's think of numbers. Suppose at rest, systolic is 120, diastolic 80. Pulse pressure is 40. During exercise, systolic might go to 200, diastolic might drop to 60. Then pulse pressure would be 140, so increased. So that's not decreased. 

So pulse pressure is increased, so option1 is out. 

Systolic BP is increased, so option3 is out. 

Stroke volume: if during exercise, even at high HR, SV is maintained through increased contractility and maybe some other factors, so SV is higher than resting. So option2 is not decreased. 

Thus, the only one decreased is TPR (option4). 

But wait, another thought: during maximal exercise, TPR actually may not decrease as much because some areas constrict (like skin during intense exercise?), but in skeletal muscle, it's definitely dilated. Overall, the net effect is decreased TPR. 

Yes, so I think the correct answer is option4. 

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because some sources say that during very high intensity exercise, TPR may not decrease as much. Wait, maybe at a certain point, when the body can't increase cardiac output enough, maybe TPR starts to go up? But in this case, the heart rate is 175, which is still within the capacity for these young men. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is looking at something else. Let me check the options again. 

Wait, another angle: stroke volume. Let me think again. 

Stroke volume is end-diastolic volume minus end-systolic volume. At high heart rates, the diastolic filling time is reduced. If the heart isn't filling as much, EDV decreases, leading to lower SV. However, during exercise, venous return is increased due to increased muscle pump activity, which might counteract the reduced filling time. So up to a point, SV increases. But beyond that, when HR is too high, SV starts to drop. 

The maximum heart rate for a 20-30 year old is around 200-220. 175 is about 80% of max, so maybe still in the range where SV is maintained or even increasing. So maybe SV is still higher than resting. 

Therefore, option2 (stroke volume) is not decreased. 

Therefore, the answer must be option4: total peripheral resistance. 

Wait but wait, the question says "during the last minute of exercise" compared to before. So if TPR is lower during exercise, then yes, it's decreased. 

So I think the correct answer is option4. But wait, the options are: 

1. Pulse pressure

2. Stroke volume

3. Systolic BP

4. Total peripheral resistance

So the answer is option4. 

Wait, but I need to confirm again. 

Alternatively, maybe pulse pressure is decreased? Wait, if diastolic goes up more? No, during exercise, diastolic usually doesn't go up as much as systolic. 

Wait, let me think of another angle. If TPR is decreased, then for a given cardiac output, the mean arterial pressure would be lower, but since cardiac output is up, MAP might be higher. 

Alternatively, the question is about which is decreased compared to before. 

So TPR is definitely lower during exercise than at rest. 

Therefore, the answer is option4. 

Hmm, but some sources say that during maximal exercise, TPR can increase slightly because of the increased sympathetic drive causing vasoconstriction in some areas. Wait, but in skeletal muscles, it's vasodilation. 

Hmm, this is a bit conflicting. Let me think again. 

The overall TPR is a balance between vasodilation in muscles and vasoconstriction in non-essential areas. The net effect is that TPR decreases. 

So I think the answer is 4. 

Wait, but I initially thought maybe stroke volume decreases. But if the question is compared to before (rest), then even if SV is lower than peak, it's still higher than resting. So stroke volume is increased, so option2 is not the answer. 

Therefore, the correct answer is option4. 

Wait, but the question states that the average pulse for the last 2 minutes is 175. So the heart rate is very high. So perhaps in that situation, the stroke volume is starting to decline. Let me check some numbers. 

Suppose a person at rest has a heart rate of 60, stroke volume 70 mL. Then CO is 4200 mL/min. 

At 175 bpm, if SV is 70, CO is 175*70 = 12,250, which is much higher. But if SV starts to drop, say to 60, CO is still 175*60=10,500, which is still higher than rest. 

So compared to before (rest), SV is still higher. So the question is which is "most likely to be decreased". Since TPR is definitely lower, that's the answer. 

Therefore, I think the correct answer is option4. 

Wait, but let me check another angle. What about pulse pressure? Pulse pressure is systolic minus diastolic. If systolic goes up a lot and diastolic goes down, then PP increases. So that's not decreased. 

So yes, TPR is decreased. 

Therefore, the final answer is option4. 

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because some sources might say that during maximal exercise, TPR doesn't decrease as much. Wait, but in this scenario, maybe since they're still on the treadmill, the muscles are dilating, so TPR is lower. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick. Let me think again. 

Wait, another approach: 

During maximal exercise, the following happens:

- HR increases (as seen

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which parameter decreases during intense exercise compared to rest in young men. It focuses on understanding acute cardiovascular responses to exercise, particularly changes in hemodynamic measurements like pulse pressure, stroke volume, systolic blood pressure, and total peripheral resistance.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Exercise Physiology**: During dynamic exercise (e.g., treadmill running), cardiac output increases due to elevated heart rate and stroke volume.  
- **Vasodilation**: Skeletal muscle arterioles dilate to enhance blood flow, reducing total peripheral resistance (TPR).  
- **Blood Pressure**: Systolic blood pressure (SBP) rises due to increased cardiac output, while diastolic blood pressure (DBP) remains stable or slightly decreases. Pulse pressure (SBP - DBP) thus increases.  
- **Stroke Volume (SV)**: SV typically increases during moderate exercise but may plateau or slightly decline at maximal heart rates due to reduced ventricular filling time. However, it remains higher than pre-exercise levels.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Pulse pressure)**: Incorrect. Pulse pressure increases during exercise because SBP rises significantly, while DBP changes minimally.  
- **Option 2 (Stroke volume)**: Incorrect. SV increases during exercise compared to rest, even at high heart rates, due to enhanced contractility and venous return.  
- **Option 3 (Systolic blood pressure)**: Incorrect. SBP increases during exercise to meet metabolic demands.  
- **Option 4 (Total peripheral resistance)**: Correct. Vasodilation in active muscles decreases TPR despite compensatory vasoconstriction in non-essential organs.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  
During exercise, skeletal muscle vasodilation dominates, significantly reducing total peripheral resistance. This decrease offsets the increased cardiac output, ensuring adequate blood flow to muscles. Other parameters (pulse pressure, stroke volume, systolic BP) increase or remain elevated compared to rest.
