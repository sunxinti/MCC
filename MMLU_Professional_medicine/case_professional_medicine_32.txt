问题: 
A 33-year-old female presents to the office with the complaint of chronic pelvic pain that began after she underwent a hysterectomy 6 months ago. Following a physical examination, a CT scan of the pelvis is ordered. After the scan is complete, the radiologist calls to report that the patient has a surgical sponge in her pelvis. In a subsequent malpractice suit, the plaintiff establishes that the sponge could not have been left unless there was negligence. The most appropriate term to represent the legal concept invoked by the patient is
选项: 
1. collateral estoppel
2. proximate cause
3. res ipsa loquitur
4. respondeat superior

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is centered around a legal concept in the context of medical malpractice. Specifically, it examines the term that best describes a situation where negligence is inferred because a surgical sponge was left inside a patient post-operation, which is considered an unlikely event without negligence.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- Understanding medical malpractice requires knowledge of legal terms that describe how negligence is established. In this scenario, the presence of a surgical sponge post-hysterectomy is a clear deviation from standard surgical practices, typically indicating a breach of the standard of care. The legal principle involved relates to how such negligence can be inferred from the nature of the incident itself without direct evidence of the negligent act.

**3. Analysis of Options**  

1. **Collateral estoppel**  
   - *Incorrect.* Collateral estoppel is a legal principle preventing the re-litigation of an issue that has already been resolved in a previous case. It does not pertain to inferring negligence from the nature of an event.

2. **Proximate cause**  
   - *Incorrect.* Proximate cause refers to the primary cause of an injury, establishing a direct link between the act of negligence and the harm caused. While relevant in malpractice, it doesn't specifically capture the inference of negligence from the event itself.

3. **Res ipsa loquitur**  
   - *Correct.* This Latin term translates to "the thing speaks for itself." It is used in legal contexts to indicate that the mere occurrence of an accident implies negligence because such an event typically does not happen without someone's negligence. In this case, a retained surgical sponge strongly suggests that negligence occurred without needing further specific evidence.

4. **Respondeat superior**  
   - *Incorrect.* Respondeat superior is a doctrine holding employers liable for the actions of their employees performed within the course of their employment. It relates to vicarious liability, not the inference of negligence from an adverse event.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question involves a malpractice case where a patient suffered chronic pelvic pain due to a retained surgical sponge after a hysterectomy. The key legal issue is identifying the doctrine that allows the plaintiff to infer negligence based solely on the occurrence of an event that typically wouldn’t happen without negligence.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- Retained surgical sponges are a well-known preventable medical error.  
- Hospitals and surgical teams implement protocols (e.g., sponge counting) to avoid such errors.  
- The plaintiff’s argument hinges on the premise that the sponge’s presence implies negligence, shifting the burden of proof to the defendant to disprove negligence.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Collateral estoppel**: This prevents relitigation of previously adjudicated issues. Irrelevant here, as no prior ruling is mentioned.  
2. **Proximate cause**: Refers to whether the defendant’s actions directly caused harm. While relevant to causation, it does not address the inference of negligence itself.  
3. **Res ipsa loquitur**: Literally “the thing speaks for itself.” This doctrine allows negligence to be inferred from the occurrence of an event that would not normally happen without negligence (e.g., retained sponges). It shifts the burden of proof to the defendant.  
4. **Respondeat superior**: Holds employers liable for employees’ actions. Unrelated to inferring negligence from the event itself.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  

The retained surgical sponge is a classic example of *res ipsa loquitur*. This doctrine applies because the event (leaving a sponge) implies negligence per se, and the plaintiff does not need to prove how the negligence occurred. The other options address causation (proximate cause) or liability structures (respondeat superior), which are not the focus here. Collateral estoppel is inapplicable as no prior litigation is referenced.

选择: 选项 3 (res ipsa loquitur)

DeepSeek的完整回答:
================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks for the legal term applicable when negligence is inferred because an event (retained surgical sponge) would not typically occur without negligence. This involves understanding medical malpractice doctrines.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- A retained surgical sponge (gossypiboma) is a "never event" (preventable error under standard care).  
- **Res ipsa loquitur** ("the thing speaks for itself") allows negligence to be presumed when:  
  - The injury would not occur without negligence.  
  - The injury was under the defendant’s exclusive control.  
  - The plaintiff did not contribute to the harm.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Collateral estoppel**: Prevents re-litigation of an already-decided issue. Irrelevant here, as no prior ruling is mentioned.  
2. **Proximate cause**: Requires proving the defendant’s action directly caused harm. The question assumes negligence is established; this term does not address the inference of negligence itself.  
3. **Res ipsa loquitur**: Directly applies when the harm (retained sponge) inherently implies negligence. Classic example in surgical cases.  
4. **Respondeat superior**: Holds employers liable for employees’ negligence. Does not address the inference of negligence, only liability after negligence is proven.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  
Res ipsa loquitur is the correct term because retained surgical sponges are prima facie evidence of negligence, satisfying the doctrine’s criteria. The plaintiff’s argument aligns with this principle, as no further proof of negligence is required beyond the sponge’s presence.
