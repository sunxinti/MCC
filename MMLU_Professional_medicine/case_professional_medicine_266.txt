问题: 
A 63-year-old woman comes to the physician 1 day after the sudden onset of pain and swelling of her right knee. She has had no injury. Her medications include occasional ibuprofen for mild osteoarthritis of both knees. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 97/min, respirations are 19/min, and blood pressure is 129/79 mm Hg. Examination of the right knee shows warmth, erythema, and effusion. Exquisite tenderness is produced with minimal range-of-motion testing. Examination of synovial fluid obtained via joint aspiration shows that it is clear, with positively birefringent rhomboids observed under polarized light microscopy. Deposition of which of the following substances is the most likely cause of these findings?
选项: 
1. Ammonium urate
2. Calcium oxalate
3. Calcium pyrophosphate
4. Calcium urate

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question presents a clinical scenario of acute knee pain and swelling in a 63-year-old woman with no history of injury. Synovial fluid analysis reveals clear fluid with positively birefringent rhomboid crystals under polarized light microscopy. The question asks which substance's deposition is most likely responsible for these findings.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Arthritic Conditions and Crystal Deposition:** Acute monoarthritis can be caused by different types of crystal-induced arthritis.
  - **Gout:** Caused by monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposition. These crystals are needle-shaped and show negative birefringence under polarized light.
  - **Pseudogout:** Caused by calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystal deposition. These crystals are rhomboid-shaped and show positive birefringence under polarized light.
- **Synovial Fluid Analysis:** The presence of crystal morphology and birefringence patterns is critical in differentiating between types of crystal-induced arthritis.
- **Clinical Presentation:** Rapid onset of joint pain and swelling, especially in older adults, is suggestive of pseudogout, particularly in the knee joint.

**3. Analysis of Options**

1. **Ammonium urate**
   - **Incorrect:** Ammonium urate crystals are typically associated with certain types of gout but are not the classic crystals seen in joint fluid analysis for typical gout, which involves monosodium urate.

2. **Calcium oxalate**
   - **Incorrect:** Calcium oxalate crystals are commonly associated with kidney stones, not with joint diseases or crystal-induced arthritis.

3. **Calcium pyrophosphate**
   - **Correct:** Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals are responsible for pseudogout. They are rhomboid-shaped and exhibit positive birefringence under polarized light, matching the synovial fluid findings described.

4. **Calcium urate**
   - **Incorrect:** Calcium urate crystals can be found in certain gout cases but are not the classic crystals identified in pseudogout. Additionally, they do not match the described rhomboid shape and positive birefringence.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
This question requires identifying the type of crystal deposition responsible for a patient's acute monoarthritis based on clinical and synovial fluid findings. Key clues include sudden onset of a warm, erythematous, tender knee effusion in an elderly patient, and synovial fluid analysis revealing clear fluid with positively birefringent rhomboid-shaped crystals under polarized light.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Clinical Context**: Acute monoarthritis in an elderly patient without trauma suggests crystal-induced arthritis. The absence of fever and normal vital signs make septic arthritis less likely.  
- **Synovial Fluid Analysis**:  
  - **Clear fluid** is more consistent with pseudogout (calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease, CPPD) than gout, which often presents with cloudy fluid due to neutrophils.  
  - **Crystal Characteristics**:  
    - **Rhomboid-shaped crystals** are characteristic of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals.  
    - **Positive birefringence** under polarized light (crystals appear blue when aligned parallel to the polarizer) confirms CPPD.  
    - **Negative birefringence** (yellow) would indicate monosodium urate (gout) or calcium oxalate.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Ammonium urate)**: These crystals are associated with chronic tophaceous gout complicated by infection or urate nephrolithiasis. They are needle-shaped and negatively birefringent. Not rhomboid or positively birefringent. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 2 (Calcium oxalate)**: These crystals are typically associated with renal calculi, not arthritis. They are often octahedral in shape and negatively birefringent. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 3 (Calcium pyrophosphate)**: CPPD crystals are rhomboid-shaped and **positively birefringent**, matching the description. They cause pseudogout, which presents similarly to gout but often involves larger joints like the knee. **Correct**.  
- **Option 4 (Calcium urate)**: This is not a recognized crystal type in arthritis. Monosodium urate (gout) crystals are needle-shaped and negatively birefringent. **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  

The patient’s synovial fluid findings are classic for calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD), which causes pseudogout. The rhomboid-shaped, positively birefringent crystals are pathognomonic for CPPD, making this the most accurate answer.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks to identify the substance causing acute monoarthritis with synovial fluid findings of positively birefringent rhomboid crystals. This requires distinguishing between crystal-induced arthropathies (e.g., gout vs. pseudogout) and other crystal deposition disorders.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Crystal Characteristics**:  
  - **Gout**: Negatively birefringent *needle-shaped* monosodium urate crystals.  
  - **Pseudogout (CPPD)**: Weakly *positively birefringent rhomboid or rod-shaped* calcium pyrophosphate crystals.  
  - **Calcium oxalate**: Bipyramidal or envelope-shaped crystals; associated with renal disease or ethylene glycol toxicity.  
- **Clinical Context**: Sudden onset in an elderly patient with osteoarthritis aligns with pseudogout. Synovial fluid clarity and absence of trauma or infection further support crystal arthropathy.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Ammonium urate)**: Not associated with acute arthritis. Urate crystals in gout are monosodium urate, not ammonium. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 2 (Calcium oxalate)**: Typically seen in renal failure or metabolic disorders; bipyramidal morphology. No clinical clues here. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 3 (Calcium pyrophosphate)**: Matches the description of rhomboid crystals with positive birefringence. Pseudogout (CPPD) is common in older adults and linked to osteoarthritis. **Correct**.  
- **Option 4 (Calcium urate)**: Not a recognized crystal in clinical practice. Gout involves monosodium urate, not calcium urate. **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The positively birefringent rhomboid crystals and clinical presentation are pathognomonic for calcium pyrophosphate deposition (pseudogout).  

**My final selection is: Option 3**
