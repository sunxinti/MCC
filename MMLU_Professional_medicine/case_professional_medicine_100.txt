问题: 
A 47-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 2 hours after the sudden onset of shortness of breath, severe chest pain, and sweating. He has no history of similar symptoms. He has hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years. His pulse is 110/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 110/50 mm Hg. A grade 3/6, diastolic blowing murmur is heard over the left sternal border and radiates to the right sternal border. Femoral pulses are decreased bilaterally. An ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
选项: 
1. Acute myocardial infarction
2. Aortic dissection
3. Esophageal rupture
4. Mitral valve prolapse

**1. Question Analysis**
- The question presents a clinical scenario involving a middle-aged man with sudden onset chest pain, shortness of breath, sweating, and specific physical exam findings. The task is to determine the most likely diagnosis among the provided options based on his symptoms, history, vital signs, and examination findings.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**
- **Sudden Chest Pain and Shortness of Breath:** These are common symptoms of acute cardiovascular events.
- **Hypertension History:** Chronic hypertension is a risk factor for several cardiovascular conditions, including aortic dissection and myocardial infarction.
- **Physical Examination Findings:**
  - **Diastolic Blowing Murmur:** Suggestive of aortic regurgitation.
  - **Radiation of the Murmur to the Right Sternal Border:** May indicate involvement of the aortic valve.
  - **Decreased Femoral Pulses:** Bilateral pulse deficits can be indicative of aortic dissection affecting the arterial branches.
- **ECG Findings:** Left ventricular hypertrophy is consistent with chronic hypertension but is not specific to the acute presentation.
- **Vital Signs:** Tachycardia and hypotension may indicate hemodynamic compromise, which can be seen in aortic dissection or acute myocardial infarction.

**3. Analysis of Options**

1. **Acute myocardial infarction**
   - *Considered because* chest pain and sweating are common symptoms.
   - *However,* the presence of a diastolic murmur and decreased femoral pulses are not typical features of myocardial infarction.

2. **Aortic dissection**
   - *Consistent with* sudden severe chest pain, diastolic murmur of aortic regurgitation, decreased femoral pulses due to possible involvement of the arterial branches, and history of hypertension.
   - *These findings strongly support* this diagnosis.

3. **Esophageal rupture**
   - *Typically presents with* severe chest pain following vomiting (Boerhaave syndrome), subcutaneous emphysema, and signs of sepsis if delayed.
   - *Does not typically present with* a diastolic murmur or decreased femoral pulses.

4. **Mitral valve prolapse**
   - *May cause chest pain and palpitations,* but typically presents with a mid-systolic click and possibly a late systolic murmur, not a diastolic murmur.
   - *Does not explain* the decreased femoral pulses or the hemodynamic instability observed.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question requires identifying the most likely diagnosis for a patient presenting with sudden-onset severe chest pain, hypotension, diastolic murmur, and decreased femoral pulses. Key considerations include acute cardiovascular emergencies, structural heart disease, and other life-threatening conditions.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Aortic Dissection**: A classic presentation includes severe tearing chest pain, hypertension (though hypotension can occur in advanced cases), widened pulse pressure, diastolic murmur (aortic regurgitation from involvement of the aortic valve), and decreased peripheral pulses due to vessel compromise. Risk factors include hypertension and smoking.  
- **Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI)**: Typically presents with ischemic chest pain, ST-segment changes on ECG, and elevated cardiac enzymes. However, hypotension (shock) can occur but is less common without ECG evidence of infarction.  
- **Esophageal Rupture**: Usually follows vomiting or instrumentation, with mediastinitis symptoms (fever, leukocytosis) and a "mediastinal crunch." The absence of vomiting and presence of a cardiac murmur make this unlikely.  
- **Mitral Valve Prolapse**: Causes systolic murmurs and clicks, not diastolic murmurs. Symptoms are typically less severe and unrelated to the described hypotension.  
- **Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH)** on ECG is a chronic finding from hypertension but does not directly explain the acute symptoms.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (AMI)**: Unlikely. While chest pain and hypotension can occur, the absence of ECG ischemic changes and the presence of a diastolic murmur and decreased pulses make this less probable.  
- **Option 2 (Aortic Dissection)**: Most consistent with the presentation. The diastolic murmur (aortic regurgitation), hypotension, decreased femoral pulses, and risk factors (hypertension, smoking) strongly support this diagnosis.  
- **Option 3 (Esophageal Rupture)**: Unlikely due to lack of vomiting history and absence of mediastinal signs.  
- **Option 4 (Mitral Valve Prolapse)**: Excluded by the diastolic murmur location (aortic area) and lack of systolic murmur features.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks for the diagnosis of a middle-aged man presenting with acute chest pain, dyspnea, and hypotension, alongside specific physical exam findings (diastolic murmur, decreased femoral pulses) and ECG evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy. The key is to identify a condition that aligns with these acute cardiovascular features and risk factors (hypertension, smoking).  

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Aortic dissection**: Sudden-onset chest pain, aortic regurgitation (diastolic murmur), pulse deficits, and hypotension are hallmark features. Hypertension and smoking are major risk factors.  
- **Acute myocardial infarction (MI)**: Typically presents with ST-segment changes on ECG; systolic murmurs (e.g., mitral regurgitation) may occur, but diastolic murmurs are not characteristic.  
- **Esophageal rupture**: Severe pain after vomiting, often with mediastinal emphysema; lacks cardiovascular findings (e.g., murmurs, pulse deficits).  
- **Mitral valve prolapse (MVP)**: Presents with a mid-systolic click and late systolic murmur; acute hypotension and pulse deficits are atypical.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Acute myocardial infarction**  
  Incorrect. ECG shows LVH but lacks acute ischemic changes (e.g., ST elevation/depression). Diastolic murmurs are not typical in MI, and pulse deficits are unrelated.  
- **Option 2: Aortic dissection**  
  Correct. Sudden-onset symptoms, diastolic murmur (aortic regurgitation), pulse deficits (compromised aortic branches), and risk factors (hypertension, smoking) strongly support this diagnosis. LVH on ECG reflects chronic hypertension.  
- **Option 3: Esophageal rupture**  
  Incorrect. No history of vomiting/retching, and findings like murmurs or pulse deficits are absent in esophageal rupture.  
- **Option 4: Mitral valve prolapse**  
  Incorrect. MVP causes systolic murmurs, not diastolic. Acute hemodynamic collapse and pulse deficits are not characteristic.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The combination of acute chest pain, diastolic murmur (aortic regurgitation), pulse deficits, and risk factors for aortic dissection makes **Option 2** the most accurate diagnosis.  

**My final selection is: Option 2**
