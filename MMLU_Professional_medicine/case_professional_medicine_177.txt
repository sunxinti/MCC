**1. Question Analysis**  
The question presents a clinical scenario involving a 15-year-old male with a 2-day history of painful swelling over the sacral area following trauma (a fall during wrestling). The swelling is erythematous, fluctuant, elevated, and has three midline pores. Additionally, the patient has a low-grade fever, and rectal examination is unremarkable. The task is to determine the most likely diagnosis among the provided options.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Anocutaneous fistula**: An abnormal connection between the anal canal and the skin, usually presenting with continuous discharge.
- **Coccygodynia**: Pain in the coccyx area, typically without associated swelling or infection signs.
- **Hidradenitis suppurativa**: A chronic inflammatory skin condition affecting apocrine gland-bearing areas, characterized by recurrent abscesses and sinus tracts, commonly in the axillae and groin, but less commonly in the sacral area.
- **Pilonidal abscess**: An acute infection near the sacrococcygeal area, often presenting with a painful, swollen, fluctuant mass with possible sinus tracts or pores. It commonly occurs in young adults and is associated with hair-containing pits or pores.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Anocutaneous fistula**: Typically presents with persistent discharge rather than an acute abscess-like presentation. The presence of three pores is not characteristic.
2. **Coccygodynia**: Involves pain localized to the coccyx without the presence of swelling, erythema, or fluctuant mass.
3. **Hidradenitis suppurativa**: While it involves abscess formation, it is less likely in the sacral area and usually presents with multiple recurrent lesions over time rather than an acute presentation after trauma.
4. **Pilonidal abscess**: Fits the clinical picture of acute painful swelling in the sacrococcygeal area, often with midline pits or pores, fluctuant mass, and can be precipitated by trauma. The presence of multiple pores and acute infection signs align with this diagnosis.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question focuses on diagnosing a painful, fluctuant mass in the sacral region following trauma, with key features including midline pores, erythema, and low-grade fever. The clinical presentation must be correlated with anatomical location, history of trauma, and characteristic physical exam findings.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Pilonidal Abscess**: A common condition in adolescents, especially those with body hair (e.g., wrestlers), characterized by a midline sinus tract in the sacral area. Trauma (e.g., friction, falls) can precipitate infection. Classic findings include erythema, fluctuance, and midline pits/sinuses.  
- **Hidradenitis Suppurativa**: A chronic inflammatory condition affecting apocrine gland-bearing areas (e.g., axillae, groin). Presents with recurrent abscesses and sinus tracts but rarely involves the sacrum.  
- **Anocutaneous Fistula**: Typically perianal, associated with Crohn’s disease or prior abscess drainage. Midline pores are absent.  
- **Coccygodynia**: Coccygeal pain due to trauma or degeneration, without abscess or skin changes.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Anocutaneous Fistula**: Incorrect. These form tracts between the anal canal and skin, usually in the perianal area. Midline pores and sacral location are inconsistent with this diagnosis.  
2. **Coccygodynia**: Incorrect. This is pain from the coccyx, often due to injury, but lacks the fluctuant mass, erythema, and midline pores described.  
3. **Hidradenitis Suppurativa**: Incorrect. Typically affects intertriginous areas and is not associated with midline sacral sinuses or trauma as a precipitating factor.  
4. **Pilonidal Abscess**: Correct. The sacral location, midline pores (sinus tracts), fluctuance, and recent trauma align perfectly. The low-grade fever and erythema confirm acute inflammation.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question involves identifying the diagnosis for a sacral prominence lesion with features of infection (fever, erythema, fluctuance) and midline pores in a young male post-trauma. Key concepts include differentiating abscesses, fistulas, chronic inflammatory conditions, and trauma-related pain.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Pilonidal abscess**: Typically occurs in the sacrococcygeal area due to hair follicle obstruction or trauma, forming a cyst/abscess with midline sinus pores. Classic presentation includes pain, fluctuance, and erythema.  
- **Anocutaneous fistula**: Connects the anal canal to perianal skin, typically near the anus, with purulent discharge. Not consistent with a sacral lesion.  
- **Coccygodynia**: Trauma-induced coccyx pain without abscess or skin changes.  
- **Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS)**: Chronic inflammatory condition affecting apocrine glands, with recurrent abscesses and sinus tracts in axillae/groin. Acute post-trauma onset and midline pores are atypical for HS.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Anocutaneous fistula)**: Incorrect. Location (perianal) and lack of rectal findings (e.g., induration) exclude this.  
- **Option 2 (Coccygodynia)**: Incorrect. Pain alone without fluctuance, pores, or fever does not match the presentation.  
- **Option 3 (Hidradenitis suppurativa)**: Incorrect. HS is chronic, multifocal, and occurs in sweat gland-rich areas (e.g., axillae), not typically triggered by acute trauma.  
- **Option 4 (Pilonidal abscess)**: Correct. Trauma-induced abscess with midline pores, fluctuance, and fever align with pilonidal disease.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  
The patient’s presentation (acute post-trauma sacral fluctuant mass, midline pores, fever) is pathognomonic for a pilonidal abscess. Other options lack the combination of location, infectious features, and characteristic sinus tracts.
