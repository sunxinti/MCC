问题: 
A 55-year-old woman with small cell carcinoma of the lung is admitted to the hospital to undergo chemotherapy. Six days after treatment is started, she develops a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F). Physical examination shows no other abnormalities. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 100/mm3 (5% segmented neutrophils and 95% lymphocytes). Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to increase this patient's leukocyte count?
选项: 
1. Darbepoetin
2. Dexamethasone

**1. Question Analysis**
- The question presents a 55-year-old woman with small cell carcinoma of the lung undergoing chemotherapy. Six days post-treatment initiation, she develops a fever and is found to have severe leukopenia (leukocyte count of 100/mm³) with a predominance of lymphocytes and a significant drop in neutrophils. The question asks for the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to increase her leukocyte count.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**
- **Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia**: Chemotherapy can cause myelosuppression, leading to neutropenia, which increases the risk of infections.
- **Fever in Neutropenic Patients**: A fever in the context of neutropenia is concerning for febrile neutropenia, a medical emergency that requires prompt management.
- **Management Strategies**:
  - **Growth Factors**: Medications like granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (e.g., filgrastim) are used to stimulate the production of neutrophils.
  - **Supportive Care**: Antibiotics are typically initiated in febrile neutropenia, but the question specifically asks about increasing leukocyte count.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Darbepoetin**
   - *Function*: An erythropoiesis-stimulating agent that increases red blood cell production.
   - *Relevance*: Not indicated for increasing white blood cells.
   - *Conclusion*: Incorrect.

2. **Dexamethasone**
   - *Function*: A corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects.
   - *Relevance*: May be used in certain cancer therapies but does not specifically increase leukocyte counts.
   - *Conclusion*: Incorrect.

3. **Filgrastim**
   - *Function*: A granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) that stimulates the bone marrow to produce neutrophils.
   - *Relevance*: Specifically indicated for chemotherapy-induced neutropenia to reduce the risk of infection.
   - *Conclusion*: Correct.

4. **Interferon alfa**
   - *Function*: Used in certain cancers and viral infections to modulate the immune response.
   - *Relevance*: Not primarily used to increase leukocyte counts in the context of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.
   - *Conclusion*: Incorrect.

**4. Final Selection**

**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question focuses on identifying the appropriate pharmacotherapy to increase leukocyte count in a neutropenic patient undergoing chemotherapy for small cell lung carcinoma. The key clinical scenario involves chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression, specifically neutropenia, which is common in small cell lung cancer treatment. The elevated temperature raises concern for infection risk in this immunocompromised patient.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia**: Chemotherapy agents commonly suppress bone marrow production, leading to reduced neutrophils (neutropenia), the primary granulocytes responsible for fighting infections.  
- **Leukocyte Count Abnormalities**: A leukocyte count of 100/mm³ (normal: 4,000–10,000/mm³) indicates severe neutropenia. The 5% segmented neutrophils and 95% lymphocytes suggest a profound granulocytopenia.  
- **Treatment Goals**: The priority is to increase neutrophil counts to reduce infection risk. Agents that stimulate granulocyte production or mobilization are critical here.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Darbepoetin**  
  - Darbepoetin is an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) that increases red blood cell production. It does not affect white blood cells.  
  - **Incorrect**.  

- **Option 2: Dexamethasone**  
  - Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that can transiently increase white blood cells by causing demargination (moving leukocytes from marginal pools into circulation). However, this effect is short-lived and does not address the underlying bone marrow suppression.  
  - Additionally, steroids may impair immune function further, which is counterproductive in a neutropenic patient with fever.  
  - **Incorrect**.  

- **Option 3: Filgrastim**  
  - Filgrastim (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, G-CSF) directly stimulates bone marrow to produce and release neutrophils. It is the standard treatment for chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, accelerating neutrophil recovery and reducing infection risk.  
  - **Correct**.  

- **Option 4: Interferon alfa**  
  - Interferon alfa has immunomodulatory effects but can suppress bone marrow function, potentially worsening cytopenias. It does not stimulate neutrophil production.  
  - **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  

Filgrastim is the only agent that directly stimulates granulocyte production in the bone marrow, addressing the root cause of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. The other options either target unrelated blood components (darbepoetin), provide transient effects without addressing bone marrow suppression (dexamethasone), or could worsen cytopenias (interferon alfa).

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question focuses on managing chemotherapy-induced severe leukopenia (neutropenia) in a patient with small cell lung carcinoma. The goal is to identify the pharmacotherapy that increases leukocyte (specifically neutrophil) count in the context of febrile neutropenia.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- Chemotherapy often causes myelosuppression, leading to neutropenia.  
- Febrile neutropenia (fever + absolute neutrophil count <500/mm³) is an oncologic emergency requiring prompt treatment to prevent sepsis.  
- Granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs), like filgrastim, stimulate neutrophil production and are standard therapy for chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.  
- Other options (e.g., erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, steroids, interferons) lack efficacy in this context or are contraindicated.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Darbepoetin**: Stimulates red blood cell production; ineffective for leukopenia/neutropenia. **Incorrect**.  
2. **Dexamethasone**: A corticosteroid with no role in stimulating neutrophil production. May mask infection and worsen outcomes. **Incorrect**.  
3. **Filgrastim**: G-CSF directly promotes neutrophil proliferation and differentiation, addressing the underlying neutropenia. **Correct**.  
4. **Interferon alfa**: Used in viral infections or specific cancers; no benefit for neutropenia and may exacerbate myelosuppression. **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The patient’s severe neutropenia and fever necessitate G-CSF therapy. Filgrastim is the only option that directly stimulates neutrophil recovery, reducing infection risk and supporting chemotherapy continuation.  

**My final selection is: Option 3**
