问题: 
A 75-year-old female presents to the office for a health maintenance examination. She says that she is more fatigued than she was at 65, but she still gardens and drives to the grocery store. Routine laboratory studies reveal a leukocyte count of 25.0 × 103/mcL (reference range 4.5-11.0 × 103/mcL) and 97% mature-appearing lymphocytes on a peripheral blood smear. Immunohistochemical stains demonstrate the lymphocytes to be of B-cell origin. The most likely diagnosis is
选项: 
1. acute lymphocytic leukemia
2. acute myelogenous leukemia
3. chronic lymphocytic leukemia
4. chronic myelogenous leukemia

**1. Question Analysis**
- The question presents a clinical scenario involving a 75-year-old female with increased fatigue and an elevated leukocyte count. The peripheral blood smear shows a high percentage of mature-appearing lymphocytes of B-cell origin. The task is to identify the most likely hematologic diagnosis from the provided options.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**
- **Leukocytosis with Lymphocytosis:** An elevated white blood cell count with a predominance of lymphocytes suggests a lymphoproliferative disorder.
- **Age of the Patient:** Certain leukemias are more common in specific age groups. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is typically seen in older adults.
- **Morphology of Lymphocytes:** The presence of mature-appearing lymphocytes points towards a chronic process rather than an acute one.
- **Immunophenotyping:** B-cell origin of the lymphocytes helps differentiate between various types of leukemias and lymphomas.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL):**
   - **Incorrect.**
   - Typically occurs in children and young adults.
   - Characterized by the presence of immature lymphoblasts, not mature lymphocytes.
2. **Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML):**
   - **Incorrect.**
   - Involves the myeloid lineage, not lymphocytes.
   - Presents with myeloblasts rather than mature lymphocytes.
3. **Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL):**
   - **Correct.**
   - Commonly diagnosed in older adults (median age around 70).
   - Characterized by elevated leukocyte counts with a high percentage of mature-appearing lymphocytes.
   - Typically of B-cell origin, as confirmed by immunohistochemical staining.
4. **Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML):**
   - **Incorrect.**
   - Involves the myeloid lineage with elevated granulocytes and their precursors.
   - Not characterized by a predominance of lymphocytes.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question requires distinguishing between acute and chronic leukemias and their lymphocytic vs. myeloid origins based on clinical presentation, lab findings, and patient demographics. Key elements include leukocytosis (25.0 × 10³/mcL), mature lymphocytes, B-cell origin, and the patient’s age and functional status.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Leukocytosis**: A markedly elevated white blood cell (WBC) count (25.0 × 10³/mcL) suggests a leukemic process.  
- **Morphology of Lymphocytes**: Mature-appearing lymphocytes point toward a chronic leukemia, as acute leukemias typically involve immature blasts.  
- **B-Cell Origin**: Indicates lymphocytic leukemia.  
- **Patient Age**: Chronic leukemias (CLL/CML) are more common in older adults, while acute leukemias (ALL/AML) are more prevalent in younger populations.  
- **Functional Status**: The patient’s preserved function (gardening, driving) aligns with chronic leukemia rather than acute leukemia, which presents with severe symptoms like organ infiltration or bleeding.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Acute lymphocytic leukemia [ALL])**: Incorrect. ALL typically involves immature lymphoblasts (not mature lymphocytes) and presents with severe symptoms (e.g., anemia, thrombocytopenia, organ infiltration). It is rare in the elderly.  
- **Option 2 (Acute myelogenous leukemia [AML])**: Incorrect. AML involves myeloid blasts, not lymphocytes, and would not show B-cell markers. The patient’s lymphocytosis and B-cell origin rule this out.  
- **Option 3 (Chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL])**: Correct. CLL is characterized by a high WBC count of mature-appearing B-cells, asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic presentation, and is most common in older adults. The lab findings (B-cell origin, mature lymphocytes) and patient demographics fit CLL.  
- **Option 4 (Chronic myelogenous leukemia [CML])**: Incorrect. CML involves myeloid cells (neutrophils) and is driven by the Philadelphia chromosome (BCR-ABL fusion gene). The lymphocytosis and B-cell origin here contradict CML.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most likely diagnosis because it is characterized by a high WBC count of mature B-lymphocytes, typically presents in older adults with mild symptoms or asymptomatic disease, and aligns with the patient’s preserved functional status. The absence of blasts and the B-cell immunophenotype exclude acute leukemias and myeloid disorders.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks for the diagnosis of a 75-year-old female with marked leukocytosis (25.0 × 10³/mcL) and a peripheral blood smear showing 97% mature-appearing B-cell lymphocytes. The focus is on differentiating chronic vs. acute leukemia and identifying the lineage (lymphocytic vs. myelogenous).

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Chronic vs. Acute Leukemia**: Acute leukemias (e.g., ALL, AML) are characterized by ≥20% blasts (immature cells) in blood or bone marrow and rapid symptom onset. Chronic leukemias (e.g., CLL, CML) involve mature or maturing cells and indolent clinical courses.  
- **Lymphocytic vs. Myelogenous Lineage**: B-cell lymphocytic leukemias (CLL, ALL) involve lymphocytes, while myelogenous leukemias (AML, CML) involve myeloid cells (granulocytes, monocytes).  
- **CLL Diagnostic Criteria**: CLL is defined by ≥5 × 10³/mcL clonal B-lymphocytes with mature appearance, often asymptomatic or with nonspecific fatigue.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)**  
  Incorrect. ALL presents with ≥20% lymphoblasts (immature cells) and aggressive symptoms (e.g., infections, bleeding). The patient’s mature lymphocytes and indolent presentation rule out ALL.  

- **Option 2: Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)**  
  Incorrect. AML involves myeloid lineage blasts (e.g., myeloblasts), not mature B-lymphocytes. The cell lineage and morphology are inconsistent.  

- **Option 3: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)**  
  Correct. CLL is characterized by clonal, mature-appearing B-lymphocytes ≥5 × 10³/mcL. The patient’s age, asymptomatic/mild presentation (fatigue), and lab findings align with CLL.  

- **Option 4: Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)**  
  Incorrect. CML involves myeloid lineage cells (neutrophils, basophils) and typically demonstrates the Philadelphia chromosome. The B-cell origin and lymphocyte predominance exclude CML.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The patient’s mature B-lymphocytes, indolent clinical course, and absence of blasts are pathognomonic for **chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)**.  

**My final selection is: Option 3**
