问题: 
A 25-year-old man comes to the emergency department because he developed chest pain and shortness of breath 1 hour ago, shortly after snorting cocaine for the first time. He rates the chest pain as a 7 on a 10-point scale and notes that the pain is radiating down his left arm. Medical history is unremarkable and the patient takes no medications or any other illicit drugs. He is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2 . The patient is diaphoretic. Vital signs are temperature 37.5°C (99.5°F), pulse 110/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 200/100 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 95%. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion. Auscultation of the heart discloses an audible S1 and S2. There is no edema, cyanosis, or clubbing of the digits. The patient is fully oriented. He is treated with supplemental oxygen, a 325-mg aspirin tablet, and intravenous nitroglycerin and lorazepam. Despite therapy, he continues to have chest pain and shortness of breath. ECG shows sinus tachycardia with no ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate additional pharmacotherapy to initiate at this time?
选项: 
1. Carvedilol
2. Furosemide
3. Metoprolol
4. Phentolamine

**1. Question Analysis**
- The question presents a 25-year-old man who developed chest pain and shortness of breath shortly after snorting cocaine. Despite initial treatment with supplemental oxygen, aspirin, intravenous nitroglycerin, and lorazepam, his symptoms persist. The ECG shows sinus tachycardia without ischemic changes. The question asks for the most appropriate additional pharmacotherapy to initiate at this time.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**
- **Cocaine-Induced Chest Pain:** Cocaine causes chest pain primarily through coronary artery vasoconstriction, increased myocardial oxygen demand, and potential for thrombosis.
- **Pathophysiology:** Cocaine blocks the reuptake of norepinephrine, leading to persistent alpha-adrenergic stimulation causing vasoconstriction, hypertension, and increased heart rate.
- **Initial Treatment:** Includes benzodiazepines (e.g., lorazepam) for anxiety and sympatholytic effects, aspirin for antiplatelet activity, nitrates for vasodilation, and supplemental oxygen as needed.
- **Additional Treatment Needs:** Persistent symptoms despite initial therapy suggest ongoing alpha-adrenergic stimulation. Beta-blockers are generally contraindicated in cocaine-induced chest pain due to the risk of unopposed alpha stimulation, which can worsen vasoconstriction and hypertension.
- **Alpha-Blockade:** Addressing alpha-adrenergic effects is crucial. Phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic blocker, can be beneficial in managing hypertensive emergencies related to cocaine use.

**3. Analysis of Options**
- **Option 1: Carvedilol**
  - *Incorrect.* Carvedilol is a non-selective beta-blocker with alpha-blocking activity. However, in the context of acute cocaine intoxication, even with alpha-blocking properties, the use of beta-blockers is generally approached with caution due to potential exacerbation of vasoconstriction.
  
- **Option 2: Furosemide**
  - *Incorrect.* Furosemide is a diuretic used primarily for volume overload and heart failure. It does not address the primary pathophysiological mechanisms at play in cocaine-induced chest pain.
  
- **Option 3: Metoprolol**
  - *Incorrect.* Metoprolol is a selective beta-1 blocker. In the setting of cocaine use, selective beta-blockers can lead to unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation, worsening hypertension and vasoconstriction.
  
- **Option 4: Phentolamine**
  - *Correct.* Phentolamine is a non-selective alpha-adrenergic blocker that counteracts the alpha-mediated vasoconstriction caused by cocaine. It is appropriate for managing hypertensive emergencies and persistent chest pain due to cocaine-induced vasoconstriction.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question involves a young patient presenting with acute chest pain and hypertension after cocaine use. The clinical scenario suggests cocaine-induced cardiovascular complications, such as coronary vasospasm or unopposed alpha-adrenergic effects. The task is to choose the most appropriate additional medication after initial treatments (aspirin, nitroglycerin, lorazepam) have failed to relieve symptoms.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Cocaine Pharmacology**: Cocaine causes vasoconstriction via blockade of norepinephrine reuptake, leading to unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation. This can result in hypertension, tachycardia, myocardial ischemia, and coronary vasospasm.  
- **Beta-Blocker Precautions**: Beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol, carvedilol) may worsen cocaine-induced hypertension by blocking beta-2 receptors while leaving alpha-1 effects unopposed, exacerbating vasoconstriction.  
- **Alpha-Adrenergic Antagonists**: Phentolamine, an alpha-1 antagonist, directly counteracts vasoconstriction caused by cocaine, reducing afterload and blood pressure.  
- **Nitroglycerin Use**: Though nitroglycerin is a vasodilator, it primarily targets veins and may not fully address severe alpha-mediated arterial vasoconstriction.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Carvedilol)**: A combined beta-blocker and alpha-1 blocker. While the alpha-1 component may help, the beta-blockade could worsen vasoconstriction. **Not first-line** due to beta-blocker risks.  
- **Option 2 (Furosemide)**: A diuretic for fluid overload or pulmonary edema. The patient has clear lungs and no edema, so this is **unlikely to address hypertension or chest pain**.  
- **Option 3 (Metoprolol)**: A beta-blocker. As discussed, beta-blockers are **contraindicated** in cocaine-induced hypertension due to the risk of unopposed alpha effects.  
- **Option 4 (Phentolamine)**: A pure alpha-1 antagonist that directly reverses vasoconstriction. This is the **most appropriate choice** to address cocaine’s alpha-mediated effects and reduce afterload.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  

Phentolamine is the correct answer because it directly antagonizes alpha-1 receptors, counteracting the severe vasoconstriction caused by cocaine. Beta-blockers (options 1 and 3) are contraindicated due to the risk of worsening unopposed alpha effects. Furosemide (option 2) is unnecessary in the absence of fluid overload. Phentolamine addresses the pathophysiology of cocaine-induced hypertension and chest pain most effectively.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question involves a young male presenting with cocaine-induced chest pain and hypertension, unresponsive to initial therapy (aspirin, nitroglycerin, lorazepam). The task is to identify the most appropriate additional pharmacotherapy, considering cocaine’s pathophysiology and contraindications in treatment.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Cocaine’s Mechanism**: Cocaine blocks norepinephrine reuptake, causing α-adrenergic-mediated vasoconstriction, hypertension, tachycardia, and increased myocardial oxygen demand. Unopposed α-stimulation can lead to coronary vasospasm or infarction.  
- **Contraindications**: Non-selective or β1-selective blockers (e.g., metoprolol) may exacerbate vasoconstriction by blocking β2-mediated vasodilation, leaving α-effects unopposed.  
- **Management Priorities**: Reduce α-mediated vasoconstriction, lower blood pressure, and alleviate ischemia. Benzodiazepines (lorazepam) and nitroglycerin are first-line, but refractory cases require α-blockade.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Carvedilol)**: A non-selective β-blocker with weak α1-blocking activity. While it has some α-blockade, its β-blockade may still worsen vasoconstriction in cocaine toxicity. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 2 (Furosemide)**: A loop diuretic. No role here, as the patient lacks signs of pulmonary edema (lungs are clear). Diuresis could worsen ischemia by reducing preload. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 3 (Metoprolol)**: A β1-selective blocker. Contraindicated in cocaine toxicity due to risk of unopposed α-mediated vasoconstriction, exacerbating hypertension and ischemia. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 4 (Phentolamine)**: A non-selective α-blocker. Directly counteracts cocaine-induced α-mediated vasoconstriction, reduces blood pressure, and improves coronary perfusion. Recommended in refractory cocaine-associated chest pain and hypertension. **Correct**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  
Phentolamine is the optimal choice as it directly addresses cocaine’s α-adrenergic effects, reversing vasoconstriction and hypertension without the risks associated with β-blockers. This aligns with guidelines for cocaine-induced cardiovascular complications.
