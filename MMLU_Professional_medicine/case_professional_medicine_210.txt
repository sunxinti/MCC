问题: 
A 47-year-old man comes to the physician 12 hours after the sudden onset of a severe occipital headache and stiff neck. He has not had any other symptoms and has no history of severe headache. He has hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Current medications include hydrochlorothiazide and ranitidine. He is oriented to person, place, and time. His temperature is 36.7°C (98.1°F), pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 160/90 mm Hg. Range of motion of the neck is decreased due to pain. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
选项: 
1. Cluster headache
2. Meningitis
3. Migraine
4. Subarachnoid hemorrhage

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question presents a clinical scenario involving a 47-year-old man with a sudden onset of a severe occipital headache and stiff neck, occurring 12 hours prior to presentation. The patient has hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux disease, is on hydrochlorothiazide and ranitidine, and exhibits limited neck motion due to pain without any focal neurological deficits. The task is to determine the most likely diagnosis from the provided options based on the presented symptoms and clinical findings.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Sudden Onset Severe Headache (Thunderclap Headache):** This type of headache is often indicative of subarachnoid hemorrhage, especially when it reaches maximum intensity within seconds to minutes.
- **Neck Stiffness:** Suggests meningeal irritation, which can be caused by subarachnoid hemorrhage or meningitis.
- **Absence of Fever and Other Systemic Symptoms:** Makes infectious causes like meningitis less likely.
- **Patient's History and Medications:** Hypertension is a risk factor for subarachnoid hemorrhage. Medications like hydrochlorothiazide do not typically contribute to acute severe headaches.
- **Neurological Examination:** Lack of focal deficits does not rule out subarachnoid hemorrhage, as it can present without them initially.
  
**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Cluster Headache:**  
   - **Characteristics:** Typically unilateral, around the eye, associated with autonomic symptoms such as tearing or nasal congestion.
   - **Relevance:** The patient's headache is occipital and involves neck stiffness, which is not characteristic of cluster headaches.  
   - **Conclusion:** Incorrect.

2. **Meningitis:**  
   - **Characteristics:** Presents with headache, neck stiffness, fever, photophobia, and possible altered mental status.
   - **Relevance:** The patient lacks fever and other systemic symptoms commonly associated with meningitis.
   - **Conclusion:** Less likely.

3. **Migraine:**  
   - **Characteristics:** Often has a history of recurrent headaches, can include nausea, photophobia, and may have an aura.
   - **Relevance:** The patient has no history of severe headaches, and the sudden onset with neck stiffness is atypical for migraine.
   - **Conclusion:** Unlikely.

4. **Subarachnoid Hemorrhage:**  
   - **Characteristics:** Sudden, severe headache (often occipital), neck stiffness due to meningeal irritation, can occur without focal neurological deficits initially.
   - **Relevance:** The patient's presentation aligns with the classic signs of subarachnoid hemorrhage, especially given the sudden onset and association with hypertension.
   - **Conclusion:** Most likely diagnosis.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question requires identifying the most likely diagnosis for a patient presenting with a sudden, severe occipital headache, stiff neck, and normal mental status 12 hours after symptom onset. Key considerations include the acute nature of the headache, associated symptoms, medical history, and physical exam findings.  

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH):** Classic presentation includes a "thunderclap" headache (sudden, severe), neck stiffness, and possible hypertension due to stress. Risk factors include hypertension (as in this patient). SAH can present without focal neurologic deficits initially.  
- **Meningitis:** Typically involves fever, altered mental status, and meningeal signs. However, afebrile cases can occur, but the absence of systemic symptoms (e.g., rash, photophobia) and normal mental status make this less likely.  
- **Migraine:** Usually throbbing, unilateral, and accompanied by nausea or photophobia. Sudden onset of the worst headache is atypical.  
- **Cluster Headache:** Severe unilateral orbital/temple pain with autonomic symptoms (e.g., tearing, nasal congestion), which are absent here.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Cluster headache):** Incorrect. Cluster headaches are unilateral, often around the eye, and accompanied by ipsilateral autonomic symptoms. The occipital location and lack of autonomic features rule this out.  
- **Option 2 (Meningitis):** Less likely. While meningitis can cause headache and neck stiffness, the absence of fever, systemic symptoms, and normal mental status reduce its probability.  
- **Option 3 (Migraine):** Unlikely. Migraines typically evolve over hours and are associated with nausea or photophobia, not sudden onset or neck stiffness.  
- **Option 4 (Subarachnoid hemorrhage):** Most likely. The sudden, severe occipital headache, neck stiffness, hypertension, and lack of focal neurologic deficits align with SAH. The patient’s history of hypertension is a risk factor.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question evaluates the ability to diagnose a sudden-onset severe occipital headache with neck stiffness in a hypertensive patient. Key considerations include differentiating between life-threatening causes (e.g., subarachnoid hemorrhage, meningitis) and benign etiologies (e.g., migraine, cluster headache).

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Sudden-onset severe headache ("thunderclap")** is a hallmark of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) but can also occur in meningitis.  
- **Neck stiffness** (nuchal rigidity) is common in SAH (due to meningeal irritation from blood) and meningitis (due to inflammation).  
- **Hypertension** is a major risk factor for SAH.  
- **Absence of fever** reduces the likelihood of bacterial meningitis but does not exclude viral meningitis.  
- **Normal neurologic exam** does not rule out SAH, as focal deficits may be absent in early stages.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Cluster headache**  
  Incorrect. Cluster headaches are unilateral, recurrent, and associated with autonomic symptoms (e.g., lacrimation). The patient’s first-ever severe headache and occipital location make this unlikely.  

- **Option 2: Meningitis**  
  Unlikely. While neck stiffness is present, the absence of fever and systemic symptoms (e.g., photophobia, altered mental status) reduces suspicion. Meningitis typically progresses over hours to days but rarely mimics the abrupt onset of SAH.  

- **Option 3: Migraine**  
  Incorrect. Migraines often have prodromal symptoms, a history of recurrent episodes, and associated nausea/phonophobia. Sudden onset without prior history and prominent neck stiffness are atypical.  

- **Option 4: Subarachnoid hemorrhage**  
  Correct. Sudden-onset "worst headache of life," occipital location, neck stiffness, and hypertension align with SAH. The lack of fever and normal neurologic exam do not exclude this diagnosis. Immediate imaging (CT head) or lumbar puncture is required for confirmation.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  
Subarachnoid hemorrhage is the most likely diagnosis due to the abrupt onset of severe headache, neck stiffness, hypertension (a key risk factor), and absence of features supporting alternative diagnoses. Missing SAH can lead to catastrophic outcomes, making this the critical consideration.
