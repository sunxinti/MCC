问题: 
A 55-year-old man has had crushing substernal chest pain on exertion over the past 6 weeks. He had a myocardial infarction 2 months ago. He takes nitroglycerin as needed and one aspirin daily.

Treatment with a β-adrenergic blocking agent is most likely to improve his symptoms due to which of the following mechanisms?
选项: 
1. Decreasing myocardial contractility
2. Dilating the coronary arteries
3. Peripheral vasodilation

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question presents a 55-year-old man with a history of myocardial infarction who is now experiencing exertional angina. It asks how β-adrenergic blocking agents (beta-blockers) improve his symptoms, providing four potential mechanisms.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
Beta-blockers are commonly used in managing ischemic heart disease, including angina pectoris. They work primarily by reducing myocardial oxygen demand and increasing oxygen supply through several mechanisms:
- **Decreasing heart rate (negative chronotropy):** Reduces myocardial oxygen consumption.
- **Decreasing myocardial contractility (negative inotropy):** Lowers cardiac workload.
- **Reducing blood pressure (negative dromotropy):** Decreases afterload.
While some beta-blockers may have additional effects, their primary role in angina management centers on reducing myocardial oxygen demand.

**3. Analysis of Options**

1. **Decreasing myocardial contractility**  
   **Correct.** Beta-blockers reduce the force of myocardial contractions, thereby decreasing myocardial oxygen demand and alleviating angina symptoms.

2. **Dilating the coronary arteries**  
   **Incorrect.** Beta-blockers do not directly cause coronary artery dilation. Vasodilators like nitrates are primarily responsible for this effect.

3. **Peripheral vasodilation**  
   **Incorrect.** While some beta-blockers may cause mild vasodilation, this is not their primary mechanism for improving angina symptoms.

4. **Preventing fibrin and platelet plugs**  
   **Incorrect.** This mechanism is associated with antiplatelet agents like aspirin, not beta-blockers.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks about the mechanism by which β-blockers improve symptoms in a patient with post-myocardial infarction (MI) angina. Key details include the patient's history of MI, ongoing angina, and current medications (nitroglycerin, aspirin). The focus is on understanding how β-blockers specifically alleviate ischemic chest pain.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Post-MI Angina Mechanism**: Angina occurs due to an imbalance between myocardial oxygen demand and supply. β-blockers reduce oxygen demand by decreasing heart rate, contractility, and myocardial wall tension.  
- **β-Blocker Actions**:  
  - Block β₁-receptors in the heart, reducing heart rate and contractility.  
  - Lower blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance, reducing afterload.  
  - Inhibit sympathetic stimulation, which is a major driver of ischemia during exertion.  
- **Other Medications**: Nitroglycerin dilates coronary arteries (increasing supply) and veins (reducing preload), while aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation. These do not directly explain the β-blocker's mechanism.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1. Decreasing myocardial contractility**:  
  Correct. β-blockers reduce myocardial contractility by blocking β₁-receptors, directly lowering oxygen demand. This is a primary mechanism for symptom improvement in angina.  

- **Option 2. Dilating the coronary arteries**:  
  Incorrect. β-blockers may *constrict* coronary arteries by blocking β₂-receptors (which mediate vasodilation). Nitroglycerin, not β-blockers, is responsible for coronary dilation.  

- **Option 3. Peripheral vasodilation**:  
  Incorrect. β-blockers reduce peripheral vascular resistance indirectly by lowering heart rate and contractility but do not directly cause vasodilation. Peripheral vasodilation is a feature of nitrates or vasodilators like hydralazine.  

- **Option 4. Preventing fibrin and platelet plugs**:  
  Incorrect. This is the role of antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin) or anticoagulants. β-blockers do not directly affect platelet aggregation or fibrin formation.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**  

**Explanation**: β-blockers improve angina symptoms primarily by reducing myocardial oxygen demand. Decreasing myocardial contractility (via β₁-receptor blockade) lowers the energy required for cardiac work, thereby alleviating ischemic pain. Other options either describe effects of different medications (e.g., nitrates, aspirin) or incorrect actions of β-blockers.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks for the mechanism by which β-blockers improve exertional angina in a post-MI patient. Key elements include understanding the pathophysiology of angina, the role of β-blockers, and differentiating their mechanisms from other treatments.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Angina Pathophysiology**: Exertional angina arises from myocardial oxygen demand-supply imbalance. Post-MI, reduced cardiac function exacerbates this.  
- **β-Blocker Mechanism**: β-blockers reduce myocardial oxygen demand via three main effects:  
  1. **Negative chronotropy** (↓ heart rate).  
  2. **Negative inotropy** (↓ contractility).  
  3. **Reduced afterload** (via ↓ cardiac output and renin-angiotensin system modulation).  
- **Relevance to Options**: Coronary vasodilation (nitrates) and antiplatelet effects (aspirin) are mechanisms of other therapies, not β-blockers. Peripheral vasodilation is not a primary β-blocker effect in this context.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Decreasing myocardial contractility)**: Correct. Reduced contractility directly lowers myocardial oxygen demand, a core mechanism of β-blockers in angina management.  
- **Option 2 (Dilating coronary arteries)**: Incorrect. β-blockers do not dilate coronaries; they may slightly constrict non-critical vessels by blocking β₂-mediated dilation.  
- **Option 3 (Peripheral vasodilation)**: Incorrect. β-blockers typically cause mild peripheral vasoconstriction (via β₂ blockade), except agents with α-blocking properties (e.g., carvedilol), which are not the standard here.  
- **Option 4 (Preventing fibrin/platelet plugs)**: Incorrect. This is the role of antiplatelets (e.g., aspirin), not β-blockers.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**  
β-blockers alleviate angina primarily by reducing myocardial oxygen demand. Decreasing contractility (negative inotropy) is a critical mechanism, alongside lowering heart rate and afterload. Options 2, 3, and 4 describe mechanisms of other therapies (nitrates, vasodilators, antiplatelets) and are irrelevant to β-blockers.
