**1. Question Analysis**  
The question presents a clinical scenario involving a 75-year-old woman experiencing band-like, burning pain in her right upper abdomen that extends from the epigastrium to the midline of the back. Notably, there is no abdominal tenderness on palpation, ultrasonography of the gallbladder is normal, and serum amylase levels are within the reference range. The task is to determine the most likely diagnosis from the provided options based on these clinical findings.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Pain Characteristics**: Band-like, burning pain that radiates from the epigastrium to the midline of the back suggests involvement of nerve pathways or dermatomes.
- **Absence of Abdominal Tenderness**: Lack of tenderness may indicate that the pain is not due to an acute inflammatory abdominal condition.
- **Normal Ultrasonography of the Gallbladder**: Rules out gallstones and acute cholecystitis.
- **Normal Serum Amylase**: Makes acute pancreatitis less likely.
- **Age and Presentation**: Consider conditions prevalent in elderly patients that can present with such pain patterns.

**3. Analysis of Options**

1. **Acalculous cholecystitis**  
   - Typically occurs in critically ill patients and presents with right upper quadrant pain and signs of infection.
   - Ultrasound may be inconclusive, but it's usually accompanied by other systemic symptoms.
   - The absence of tenderness and normal ultrasound findings make this less likely.

2. **Chronic relapsing pancreatitis**  
   - Presents with recurrent abdominal pain, often radiating to the back.
   - However, chronic pancreatitis usually shows elevated pancreatic enzymes, and imaging might reveal changes in the pancreas, which are not indicated here.
   - Normal serum amylase reduces the likelihood.

3. **Diverticulitis of the cecum**  
   - More common in the left colon; right-sided diverticulitis (cecal) is less common.
   - Presents with right lower quadrant pain rather than upper abdominal pain radiating to the back.
   - Does not typically present with burning pain or band-like distribution.

4. **Herpes zoster**  
   - Can cause a burning, band-like pain following a dermatome.
   - Can affect the abdominal area, causing pain without initial skin lesions (before the rash appears).
   - Pain can radiate to the back and follows a nerve pathway, fitting the description.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question requires identifying the most likely diagnosis in a 75-year-old woman with band-like, burning pain radiating from the epigastrium to the midline of the back. Key points include the absence of abdominal tenderness, normal gallbladder ultrasound, and normal serum amylase. The clinical presentation must be matched to the provided options using medical reasoning.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Band-like, burning pain**: Suggests neuropathic origin, such as herpes zoster (shingles), which typically follows a dermatomal distribution.  
- **Normal ultrasound and amylase**: Rules out gallbladder pathology (e.g., cholecystitis) and acute pancreatitis, which usually present with elevated amylase.  
- **Absence of tenderness**: Contradicts inflammatory conditions like diverticulitis or pancreatitis, which often cause abdominal tenderness.  
- **Age**: Older adults are at higher risk for herpes zoster due to waning immunity.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Acalculous cholecystitis**: Requires gallbladder inflammation without stones. However, normal ultrasound (no wall thickening or sludge) and absence of tenderness make this unlikely.  
2. **Chronic relapsing pancreatitis**: Persistent epigastric/back pain can occur, but normal serum amylase and lack of tenderness are atypical. Chronic pancreatitis may present with elevated lipase, but the pain distribution here aligns less well.  
3. **Diverticulitis of the cecum**: Typically causes right lower quadrant pain and tenderness. The described pain location and lack of tenderness make this improbable.  
4. **Herpes zoster**: The band-like, burning pain along a dermatome (T6–T12) is classic. The absence of rash initially (prodromal phase) and normal labs support this. The pain distribution (epigastrium to back) aligns with thoracic dermatomes affected in shingles.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  

Herpes zoster is the most likely diagnosis. The patient’s band-like, burning pain following a dermatomal distribution (T6–T12) and absence of inflammatory signs (normal ultrasound, amylase, and no tenderness) align with this condition. The lack of rash is consistent with the prodromal phase of shingles, where pain precedes cutaneous manifestations. Other options are inconsistent with the provided clinical and laboratory findings.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question involves identifying the cause of band-like, burning pain in the right upper abdomen and mid-back in an elderly patient. Key features include normal imaging (gallbladder ultrasound) and laboratory (amylase) findings, along with absence of abdominal tenderness. The goal is to differentiate between gastrointestinal, inflammatory, and neuropathic etiologies.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Pain characteristics**: Burning, band-like pain suggests neuropathic involvement (e.g., herpes zoster).  
- **Anatomical localization**: The pain spans the epigastrium to the mid-back, aligning with a dermatomal distribution (e.g., thoracic spinal nerve roots).  
- **Diagnostic findings**:  
  - Normal gallbladder ultrasound and amylase rules out acute biliary/pancreatic pathology.  
  - Lack of tenderness reduces likelihood of inflammatory abdominal conditions (e.g., cholecystitis, diverticulitis).  
- **Risk factors**: Advanced age increases susceptibility to herpes zoster.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Acalculous cholecystitis**  
  Incorrect. Typically presents with right upper quadrant tenderness, fever, and leukocytosis. Ultrasound often shows gallbladder wall thickening or sludge, which are absent here.  

- **Option 2: Chronic relapsing pancreatitis**  
  Incorrect. Chronic pancreatitis may cause epigastric/back pain, but serum amylase is often elevated during acute flares. Normal amylase and lack of imaging findings (e.g., calcifications, ductal changes) make this less likely.  

- **Option 3: Diverticulitis of the cecum**  
  Incorrect. Cecal diverticulitis classically causes right lower quadrant pain, mimicking appendicitis. The described pain location (RUQ/back) and absence of tenderness/imaging abnormalities argue against this.  

- **Option 4: Herpes zoster**  
  Correct. Burning, dermatomal pain (thoracic nerve distribution) without abdominal signs or lab/imaging abnormalities aligns with preherpetic neuralgia. Elderly patients often present with pain preceding the rash by days.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  
Herpes zoster is the most likely diagnosis given the neuropathic pain pattern, absence of abdominal pathology on testing, and the patient’s age. Other options fail to explain the lack of tenderness, normal imaging, and burning quality of pain.
