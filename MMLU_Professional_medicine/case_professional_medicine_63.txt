问题: 
A 20-year-old man has had frequent upper respiratory tract infections over the past 4 years. He has daily purulent sputum and has noted decreased exercise tolerance over the past 2 years. He and his wife have been unable to conceive because of his low sperm count. Scattered expiratory wheezing and rhonchi are heard throughout both lung fields. An x-ray of the chest shows hyperinflation. Spirometry shows a decreased FEV1:FVC ratio. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?
选项: 
1. Arterial blood gas analysis
2. Examination of sputum for eosinophils
3. Sweat chloride test
4. Sputum cytology

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question presents a 20-year-old man with a history of frequent upper respiratory infections, daily purulent sputum, decreased exercise tolerance, infertility due to low sperm count, expiratory wheezing, rhonchi, hyperinflation on chest X-ray, and an obstructive pattern on spirometry (decreased FEV1:FVC ratio). The task is to identify the most appropriate diagnostic test to confirm the underlying condition based on these clinical features.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
The patient's symptoms suggest a chronic respiratory condition characterized by recurrent infections and obstructive airway disease. Key considerations include:

- **Cystic Fibrosis (CF):** A genetic disorder affecting the CFTR protein, leading to thick mucus production that causes recurrent respiratory infections, obstructive lung disease, and infertility in males due to congenital absence of the vas deferens.
  
- **Obstructive Lung Diseases:** Conditions like asthma and chronic bronchitis also present with obstructive spirometry, but the presence of infertility points more towards CF.

- **Diagnostic Tests:** Identifying the most specific test for the suspected condition is crucial for accurate diagnosis.

**3. Analysis of Options**

1. **Arterial blood gas analysis**
   - *Evaluation:* Assesses gas exchange and acid-base status.
   - *Relevance:* Useful in evaluating respiratory function but non-specific for diagnosing specific obstructive diseases like CF.
   - *Conclusion:* Not the most definitive test for CF.

2. **Examination of sputum for eosinophils**
   - *Evaluation:* Typically used to identify eosinophilic inflammation, common in asthma.
   - *Relevance:* More relevant for allergic or eosinophilic conditions, not CF.
   - *Conclusion:* Less relevant for the suspected diagnosis.

3. **Sweat chloride test**
   - *Evaluation:* Measures the concentration of chloride in sweat.
   - *Relevance:* The gold standard diagnostic test for Cystic Fibrosis, as CF patients have elevated sweat chloride levels.
   - *Conclusion:* Highly specific and appropriate for confirming CF.

4. **Sputum cytology**
   - *Evaluation:* Analyzes cells in sputum, mainly used for diagnosing cancers like bronchogenic carcinoma.
   - *Relevance:* Not relevant to the patient's presentation, especially given his young age and reproductive issues.
   - *Conclusion:* Not appropriate for the suspected diagnosis.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks for the most appropriate test to confirm the diagnosis in a patient with chronic respiratory symptoms (frequent infections, purulent sputum, expiratory wheezing, hyperinflation, obstructive spirometry), infertility due to low sperm count, and a clinical picture suggestive of a genetic disorder affecting multiple systems.  

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Clinical Clues**:  
  - Recurrent upper respiratory infections and chronic purulent sputum suggest chronic airway disease.  
  - Decreased exercise tolerance and obstructive spirometry (low FEV1/FVC) indicate airflow limitation.  
  - Infertility with low sperm count raises suspicion of congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD), often associated with cystic fibrosis (CF).  
  - Hyperinflation on chest X-ray is consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or CF.  

- **Differential Diagnoses**:  
  - **Cystic Fibrosis (CF)**: Autosomal recessive disorder causing thick mucus in lungs, pancreas, and reproductive tract. Classic features include chronic infections, bronchiectasis, CBAVD in males, and obstructive lung disease.  
  - **Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD)**: Also causes recurrent infections and infertility but typically with normal sweat chloride.  
  - **Bronchiectasis**: May present with purulent sputum but lacks the systemic features (infertility, genetic basis).  

- **Diagnostic Tests**:  
  - **Sweat Chloride Test**: Gold standard for CF, with a sweat chloride level ≥60 mmol/L confirming the diagnosis.  
  - **Genetic Testing**: Identifies CFTR mutations but is less definitive than sweat chloride.  
  - **Sputum Culture**: May identify pathogens but does not confirm the underlying disorder.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Arterial Blood Gas Analysis)**:  
  - ABG may show hypoxemia or hypercapnia in advanced disease but is nonspecific. It does not confirm CF and is not required for diagnosis. **Incorrect**.  

- **Option 2 (Sputum for Eosinophils)**:  
  - Eosinophils suggest asthma or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. The patient’s symptoms are chronic and systemic, not episodic allergic reactions. **Incorrect**.  

- **Option 3 (Sweat Chloride Test)**:  
  - Confirms CF if sweat chloride is ≥60 mmol/L. The patient’s infertility (CBAVD), chronic infections, and obstructive lung disease strongly align with CF. **Correct**.  

- **Option 4 (Sputum Cytology)**:  
  - Evaluates for malignancy, which is unrelated to the patient’s clinical presentation. **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  

The patient’s clinical features (infertility due to CBAVD, chronic infections, obstructive lung disease) are classic for cystic fibrosis. The sweat chloride test is the definitive diagnostic test for CF, making it the correct choice. Other options do not address the underlying genetic disorder or provide confirmatory evidence.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question presents a young male with chronic respiratory symptoms (recurrent infections, purulent sputum, wheezing, hyperinflation, obstructive spirometry) and infertility due to low sperm count. The task is to identify the diagnostic test most likely to confirm the underlying condition linking these findings.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Cystic fibrosis (CF)** is a genetic disorder causing thick mucus in respiratory, digestive, and reproductive systems. Key features include chronic lung infections, bronchiectasis, and male infertility (congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens, CBAVD).  
- **Sweat chloride test** is the gold standard for CF diagnosis, measuring elevated chloride levels due to CFTR channel dysfunction.  
- **Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD)** can mimic CF but often includes situs inversus (Kartagener syndrome).  
- **Obstructive spirometry (↓FEV1:FVC)** aligns with chronic airway obstruction, as seen in CF or severe asthma. However, purulent sputum and infertility strongly favor CF.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Arterial blood gas):** Assesses oxygenation/acid-base status but does not diagnose the underlying cause.  
- **Option 2 (Sputum eosinophils):** Indicates eosinophilic inflammation (e.g., asthma, allergies), inconsistent with purulent sputum from chronic infections.  
- **Option 3 (Sweat chloride test):** Directly evaluates CFTR dysfunction, confirming CF. Matches the clinical triad of respiratory disease, infertility, and obstructive lung disease.  
- **Option 4 (Sputum cytology):** Identifies cellular abnormalities (e.g., malignancy) or pathogens but does not diagnose CF.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The clinical presentation (chronic respiratory infections, obstructive lung disease, and infertility) strongly suggests cystic fibrosis. The **sweat chloride test** is the definitive diagnostic tool for CF, making it the most accurate choice.  

**My final selection is: Option 3**
