问题: 
A 32-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after being struck by a car while driving his motorcycle. He reports severe pelvic pain. On examination, there is bruising of the perineum and pain is elicited with motion of his pelvis. Blood is noted at the urethral meatus. There is no other penile trauma. A plain x-ray shows a fracture of the superior pubic ramus and retrograde urethrography is done to evaluate for a urethral disruption. Which of the following portions of the urethra would be at greatest risk for injury in this patient?
选项: 
1. Intramural (pre-prostatic)
2. Membranous
3. Prostatic
4. Spongy

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question presents a trauma scenario involving a pelvic fracture and signs suggestive of urethral injury. It asks which specific portion of the male urethra is most susceptible to injury in the context of a pelvic fracture.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Anatomy of the Male Urethra:** The male urethra is divided into four parts:
  1. **Prostatic Urethra:** Passes through the prostate gland.
  2. **Membranous Urethra:** Short segment passing through the urogenital diaphragm.
  3. **Spongy (Bulbar and Penile) Urethra:** Extends through the corpus spongiosum of the penis.
  4. **Intramural (Pre-prostatic):** Lies within the prostate but is generally more related to internal structures.
  
- **Mechanism of Injury:** Pelvic fractures can cause shearing forces that disrupt the urethra, particularly where it is fixed or less mobile.
  
- **Clinical Indicators of Urethral Injury:** Blood at the urethral meatus, perineal bruising, and pelvic tenderness are classic signs suggesting possible urethral injury.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Intramural (pre-prostatic)**
  - **Incorrect.** This portion is less susceptible to traumatic injury from pelvic fractures compared to other segments.
  
- **Option 2: Membranous**
  - **Correct.** The membranous urethra is most vulnerable to injury during pelvic fractures due to its fixed position at the urogenital diaphragm, making it susceptible to shearing forces.
  
- **Option 3: Prostatic**
  - **Incorrect.** The prostatic urethra is more protected as it passes through the prostate gland and is less likely to be injured directly by pelvic fractures.
  
- **Option 4: Spongy**
  - **Incorrect.** While the spongy urethra can be injured, especially in straddle injuries, it is less commonly affected by pelvic fractures compared to the membranous segment.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which part of the urethra is most at risk of injury in a patient with a pelvic fracture (superior pubic ramus) and signs of urethral disruption (hematuria at the meatus). The key is linking pelvic trauma mechanisms to specific urethral injury sites.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Pelvic Fracture Mechanism**: High-impact trauma (e.g., motor vehicle accident) can cause pelvic ring disruptions, leading to urethral injury.  
- **Urethral Anatomy**: The male urethra has posterior (prostatic, membranous) and anterior (spongy) segments. The **membranous urethra** is fixed in the pelvic floor, making it prone to injury during pelvic compression.  
- **Clinical Correlations**:  
  - **Membranous Urethral Injury**: Associated with pelvic fractures (especially those involving the pelvic ring), often presenting with hematuria at the meatus and a "high-riding" prostate on rectal exam.  
  - **Spongy Urethral Injury**: More common in straddle injuries (e.g., falling on a bike bar), with obvious perineal trauma.  
  - **Prostatic Urethra**: Rarely injured in trauma unless there is catastrophic pelvic disruption.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Intramural/Pre-prostatic)**: Refers to the prostatic urethra. While part of the posterior urethra, it is less commonly injured than the membranous portion in pelvic fractures.  
- **Option 2 (Membranous)**: The fixed membranous urethra is the most vulnerable to injury in pelvic fractures due to its anatomical location in the pelvic floor. Compression or displacement of pelvic bones (e.g., superior pubic ramus fracture) directly stresses this segment.  
- **Option 3 (Prostatic)**: Similar to the intramural urethra, this is part of the posterior urethra but is rarely injured in routine pelvic trauma.  
- **Option 4 (Spongy)**: More associated with straddle injuries or direct perineal trauma, not high-impact pelvic fractures.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  
The membranous urethra is the most vulnerable segment in pelvic fractures due to its fixed position in the pelvic floor. The patient’s mechanism of injury (high-impact trauma causing superior pubic ramus fracture) and clinical findings (hematuria at the meatus) align with a posterior urethral injury, specifically the membranous portion.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question assesses knowledge of urethral anatomy and injury patterns associated with pelvic trauma. It requires identifying the urethral segment most vulnerable to disruption in a patient with a pelvic fracture and clinical signs of urethral injury (e.g., blood at the urethral meatus).

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Male Urethral Anatomy**: The male urethra is divided into **posterior** (prostatic and membranous) and **anterior** (spongy/bulbar and penile) segments.  
- **Pelvic Fracture Mechanisms**: High-impact pelvic fractures (e.g., from motor vehicle accidents) often injure the **posterior urethra** due to shearing forces from pubic bone displacement.  
- **Membranous Urethra**: This segment is the shortest, least mobile, and traverses the urogenital diaphragm. It is anatomically fixed, making it prone to tearing during pelvic fractures.  
- **Clinical Signs**: Blood at the urethral meatus, perineal bruising, and inability to void strongly suggest urethral disruption, typically in the posterior urethra.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Intramural/pre-prostatic)**: The intramural urethra is part of the bladder neck and rarely injured in pelvic trauma. Incorrect.  
- **Option 2 (Membranous)**: The membranous urethra is the most common site of injury in pelvic fractures due to its fixed position between the prostatic and spongy urethra. Correct.  
- **Option 3 (Prostatic)**: The prostatic urethra is surrounded by the prostate gland, which is relatively protected by the pelvic bones. Unlikely to be injured in this scenario. Incorrect.  
- **Option 4 (Spongy)**: The spongy urethra is part of the anterior urethra and typically injured in straddle trauma, not pelvic fractures. Incorrect.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The membranous urethra (Option 2) is anatomically vulnerable to shearing forces from pelvic fractures, aligning with the patient’s mechanism of injury and clinical findings.  

**My final selection is: Option 2**
