问题: 
A 60-year-old man had a total thyroidectomy and excision of enlarged left jugular lymph nodes for follicular carcinoma. The operation was uncomplicated. He is receiving intravenous 5% dextrose and 0.45% saline with potassium. Twelve hours after the operation he develops circumoral numbness and paresthesias in his fingertips, and he becomes very anxious. Vital signs are temperature 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse 90/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg. Physical examination discloses a dry neck dressing and no stridor. Extremities are warm, with brisk capillary refill time. Additional physical examination is most likely to show which of the following?
选项: 
1. Babinski sign present bilaterally
2. Chvostek sign
3. Deviation of the tongue to the left side
4. A drooping left shoulder

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question assesses the recognition of postoperative complications following a total thyroidectomy and lymph node excision for follicular carcinoma. Specifically, it focuses on identifying symptoms and signs indicative of a particular metabolic or neurological disturbance that may arise after the surgery.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Post-Thyroidectomy Complications:** One of the primary concerns after thyroid surgery is inadvertent damage or removal of the parathyroid glands, leading to hypocalcemia.
- **Hypocalcemia Symptoms:** Patients may present with neuromuscular irritability, including circumoral numbness, paresthesias in the extremities, muscle cramps, and anxiety. Physical examination may reveal positive neuromuscular signs such as Chvostek and Trousseau's signs.
- **Chvostek Sign:** This is elicited by tapping the facial nerve at the angle of the jaw, causing twitching of the facial muscles, and is a clinical indicator of hypocalcemia.
- **Differential Considerations:** Other options present signs associated with different neurological or muscular issues, which are less likely in the context of thyroid surgery and the presented symptoms.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Babinski sign present bilaterally:** 
   - **Incorrect.** Babinski sign indicates upper motor neuron lesions and is unrelated to the current clinical scenario.
2. **Chvostek sign:** 
   - **Correct.** This sign is consistent with hypocalcemia, a likely complication after thyroidectomy due to potential parathyroid gland damage.
3. **Deviation of the tongue to the left side:** 
   - **Incorrect.** This suggests hypoglossal nerve injury, which is not indicated by the patient's symptoms or surgical history.
4. **A drooping left shoulder:** 
   - **Incorrect.** This could indicate accessory nerve damage or brachial plexus injury, which are not suggested by the patient's presentation.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question focuses on post-thyroidectomy complications, specifically symptoms suggesting electrolyte imbalance (circumoral numbness, paresthesias, anxiety). The task is to identify the most likely additional physical exam finding.  

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Hypocalcemia** is a critical post-thyroidectomy complication due to inadvertent parathyroid gland injury. Symptoms include perioral/limb paresthesias, muscle cramps, tetany, and anxiety.  
- **Chvostek sign** (facial muscle twitching in response to tapping the facial nerve) and **Trousseau sign** (carpal spasm induced by blood pressure cuff inflation) are classic signs of hypocalcemia.  
- Other options relate to nerve injuries or neurological deficits (e.g., Babinski, tongue deviation) or anatomical changes (drooping shoulder), which are less directly linked to the described symptoms.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Babinski sign present bilaterally):** A positive Babinski sign indicates an upper motor neuron lesion (e.g., spinal cord or corticospinal tract damage). This is unrelated to hypocalcemia and not suggested by the clinical context. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 2 (Chvostek sign):** Directly linked to hypocalcemia. The patient’s symptoms (paresthesias, numbness, anxiety) strongly suggest hypocalcemia, and Chvostek sign is a hallmark of this condition. **Correct**.  
- **Option 3 (Deviation of the tongue to the left side):** Tongue deviation suggests hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) palsy. While possible if the nerve was injured during surgery, this is less likely given the symptoms point to hypocalcemia. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 4 (Drooping left shoulder):** Suggests injury to the brachial plexus or phrenic nerve. This is a rare complication of thyroid surgery and unrelated to the described electrolyte disturbance. **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question involves identifying the most likely physical examination finding in a patient presenting with circumoral numbness, paresthesias, and anxiety 12 hours after total thyroidectomy. The key clinical context is postoperative complications of thyroidectomy, particularly hypocalcemia due to parathyroid gland injury or removal.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Hypocalcemia**: A common complication after thyroidectomy due to parathyroid gland damage or inadvertent removal. Low calcium levels lead to neuromuscular irritability, manifesting as perioral/fingertip paresthesias, muscle cramps, anxiety, and characteristic signs like **Chvostek sign** (facial nerve hyperexcitability) and **Trousseau sign** (carpopedal spasm).  
- **Other complications**:  
  - **Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury**: Causes hoarseness or stridor (absent here).  
  - **Hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) injury**: Tongue deviation to the affected side.  
  - **Spinal accessory nerve (CN XI) injury**: Weakness in shoulder elevation (drooping shoulder).  
  - **Bleeding**: Presents with neck swelling, respiratory distress (excluded by dry dressing and absence of stridor).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Babinski sign)**: Indicates upper motor neuron dysfunction (e.g., stroke, spinal cord injury). Unrelated to hypocalcemia or the patient’s symptoms. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 2 (Chvostek sign)**: A hallmark of hypocalcemia, elicited by tapping the facial nerve. Directly correlates with the patient’s neuromuscular irritability. **Correct**.  
- **Option 3 (Tongue deviation)**: Suggests hypoglossal nerve injury, which would occur intraoperatively. However, the surgery was uncomplicated, and the symptoms are inconsistent with nerve injury. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 4 (Drooping left shoulder)**: Indicates spinal accessory nerve injury, typically during lymph node dissection. No evidence of shoulder weakness in the clinical scenario. **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The patient’s symptoms (circumoral numbness, paresthesias, anxiety) and postoperative context strongly indicate hypocalcemia. Chvostek sign is the most specific physical finding for this condition.  

**My final selection is: Option 2**
