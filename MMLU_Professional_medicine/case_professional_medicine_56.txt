问题: 
A 22-year-old man comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. He feels well. He has had a painless left scrotal mass since childhood. Examination shows a 6-cm, soft, nontender left scrotal mass that transilluminates; there are no bowel sounds in the mass. Examination of the testis shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the mass?
选项: 
1. Accumulation of scrotal adipose tissue
2. Cryptorchidism of the left testis
3. Dilation of the pampiniform plexus of veins around the testis
4. Persistence of a patent processus vaginalis

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question presents a clinical scenario involving a 22-year-old man with a long-standing, painless left scrotal mass. Key features include the mass being soft, non-tender, transilluminating, and without associated bowel sounds. The testicular examination is normal. The question seeks to identify the most likely underlying cause of this scrotal mass based on the provided options.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
Understanding scrotal masses involves differentiating between fluid-filled and solid masses:
- **Transillumination**: Suggests a fluid-filled structure such as a hydrocele or spermatocele.
- **Absence of bowel sounds**: Makes hernias less likely.
- **Consistency and tenderness**: Soft and non-tender masses are typically benign.
- **Persistence since childhood**: Indicates a congenital condition rather than an acquired one.

Relevant conditions:
- **Hydrocele**: Accumulation of fluid around the testis, often transilluminates.
- **Varicocele**: Dilated pampiniform plexus, feels like "bag of worms," usually does not transilluminate.
- **Cryptorchidism**: Undescended testis, which is not present here as testicular examination is normal.
- **Scrotal adipose accumulation**: Typically does not transilluminate and is less common.

**3. Analysis of Options**

1. **Accumulation of scrotal adipose tissue**
   - **Incorrect**: While it can cause scrotal enlargement, it does not typically transilluminate and is not consistent with the long-standing nature since childhood in this context.

2. **Cryptorchidism of the left testis**
   - **Incorrect**: The patient has normal testicular examination findings, ruling out undescended testis.

3. **Dilation of the pampiniform plexus of veins around the testis**
   - **Incorrect**: This describes a varicocele, which usually presents with a "bag of worms" feeling and does not transilluminate.

4. **Persistence of a patent processus vaginalis**
   - **Correct**: A patent processus vaginalis can lead to a hydrocele, which is a fluid-filled sac that transilluminates and aligns with the patient's long-standing, painless scrotal mass.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks for the most likely cause of a painless, soft, transilluminating scrotal mass in a young adult with a normal testis and no bowel sounds. Key features include transillumination, absence of bowel sounds, and the mass’s association with the testis but not involving it.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Transillumination**: Indicates a cystic or fluid-filled structure (e.g., hydrocele).  
- **No bowel sounds**: Rules out hernias (e.g., indirect inguinal hernia).  
- **Normal testis on exam**: Excludes testicular tumors or cryptorchidism.  
- **Painless and since childhood**: Suggests a congenital or chronic process.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Accumulation of scrotal adipose tissue (lipoma)**:  
   - Fat is solid and does **not** transilluminate. This is inconsistent with the findings. **Incorrect**.  

2. **Cryptorchidism (undescended testis)**:  
   - Cryptorchidism involves the testis itself being undescended or abnormal. Since the testis is normal here, this is **incorrect**.  

3. **Dilation of pampiniform plexus (varicocele)**:  
   - Varicoceles are tortuous veins around the testis, often described as a "bag of worms." They may partially transilluminate but are more likely to be palpable and associated with a "dragging" sensation. The absence of bowel sounds and the large size (6 cm) make this **less likely** than a hydrocele. **Incorrect**.  

4. **Persistence of a patent processus vaginalis (hydrocele)**:  
   - A patent processus vaginalis allows fluid accumulation around the testis, forming a hydrocele. This is a soft, cystic mass that transilluminates, lacks bowel sounds, and is common in childhood. The description perfectly aligns with this diagnosis. **Correct**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  

The mass is most consistent with a hydrocele caused by a persistent patent processus vaginalis. The transillumination, absence of bowel sounds, and normal testis rule out other options. A hydrocele is a fluid-filled sac around the testis, which fits the clinical presentation.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks to identify the cause of a painless, soft, nontender left scrotal mass in a 22-year-old man present since childhood. Key features include transillumination, absence of bowel sounds, and a normal testis. The answer hinges on recognizing the clinical significance of these findings and correlating them with developmental or anatomical abnormalities.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Transillumination** indicates a fluid-filled structure (e.g., hydrocele) rather than solid tissue or fat.  
- **Absence of bowel sounds** rules out an inguinal hernia (which would involve bowel loops).  
- **Congenital persistence of the processus vaginalis** allows peritoneal fluid to accumulate in the scrotum, forming a hydrocele. This structure typically closes after testicular descent; failure to close leads to communication between the peritoneum and scrotum.  
- **Varicoceles** (dilated pampiniform veins) do not transilluminate and present as a "bag of worms."  
- **Cryptorchidism** (undescended testis) is excluded as the testis is normal on exam.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Adipose tissue):** Fat does not transilluminate. Incorrect.  
- **Option 2 (Cryptorchidism):** The testis is normal, ruling out an undescended testis. Incorrect.  
- **Option 3 (Varicocele):** Varicoceles do not transilluminate and typically present post-puberty. Incorrect.  
- **Option 4 (Patent processus vaginalis):** Explains fluid accumulation (hydrocele) due to persistent communication between the peritoneum and scrotum. Transillumination and absence of bowel sounds align with this diagnosis. Correct.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The most likely cause is a congenital hydrocele secondary to a patent processus vaginalis, which allows fluid accumulation without herniation of bowel. This aligns with transillumination, absence of bowel sounds, and a long-standing history.  

**My final selection is: Option 4**
