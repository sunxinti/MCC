问题: 
A 35-year-old man comes to the office for follow-up of sarcoidosis. His only new complaint is pain in his legs that increases with weight-bearing. He has been taking glucocorticoid therapy for the past 6 months. Vital signs now are temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse 78/min, respirations 14/min, and blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg. The patient is thin and is in no acute distress. Auscultation of the chest discloses scattered bilateral basilar crackles. There is mild left hip pain present with both active and passive range of motion. Dorsalis pedis pulse is intact. Neurologic examination is normal. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?
选项: 
1. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head
2. Herniated nucleus pulposus
3. Narrowing of the hip joint
4. Osteoporosis

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question presents a 35-year-old male patient with a history of sarcoidosis on glucocorticoid therapy who now experiences leg pain exacerbated by weight-bearing. The task is to determine the most likely cause of his symptoms from the provided options, considering his current medications and clinical presentation.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**

- **Glucocorticoid Therapy:** Long-term use of glucocorticoids is associated with several musculoskeletal complications, including osteoporosis and avascular necrosis (osteonecrosis) of the femoral head.
  
- **Avascular Necrosis (Option 1):** Caused by interruption of blood supply to the femoral head, leading to bone death. Common in patients on chronic steroids. Presents with hip pain that may radiate to the knee or groin and worsens with weight-bearing.
  
- **Herniated Nucleus Pulposus (Option 2):** Typically presents with radicular pain, often in the lower back radiating down the legs, accompanied by neurological deficits such as altered reflexes or muscle weakness.
  
- **Narrowing of the Hip Joint (Option 3):** Often associated with osteoarthritis, presenting with joint stiffness, decreased range of motion, and pain worsened by activity.
  
- **Osteoporosis (Option 4):** Characterized by decreased bone density, increasing the risk of fractures. While it can cause bone pain, it often presents with acute pain following a fracture rather than chronic hip pain.

**3. Analysis of Options**

1. **Avascular necrosis of the femoral head**
   - **Correctness:** Likely. The patient is on long-term glucocorticoids, a known risk factor. Presents with hip pain worsened by weight-bearing without neurological deficits or vascular compromise.
   
2. **Herniated nucleus pulposus**
   - **Correctness:** Less likely. The absence of neurological symptoms (normal neurologic examination) makes this option improbable.
   
3. **Narrowing of the hip joint**
   - **Correctness:** Possible but less likely given the patient's age and lack of typical osteoarthritis features like joint stiffness or decreased range of motion.
   
4. **Osteoporosis**
   - **Correctness:** Possible but less likely. Osteoporosis-related pain usually follows a fracture, which is not indicated here.

**4. Final Selection**

**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks for the most likely cause of a patient’s leg pain exacerbated by weight-bearing, given his history of sarcoidosis and long-term glucocorticoid use. Key considerations include medication side effects, musculoskeletal complications, and sarcoidosis-related pathology.  

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Glucocorticoid Therapy Side Effects**: Long-term glucocorticoid use is strongly associated with **avascular necrosis** (most commonly of the femoral head), osteoporosis, and secondary fractures. Avascular necrosis occurs due to disrupted blood flow to bone marrow, leading to bone death.  
- **Sarcoidosis-Related Complications**: Sarcoidosis can cause arthritis (usually symmetric and polyarticular), but hip involvement is less common. Pulmonary crackles are consistent with sarcoidosis but not directly linked to the hip pain.  
- **Mechanical Causes**: Herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP) typically causes radicular pain (e.g., sciatica) with neurologic deficits. Narrowing of the hip joint (e.g., secondary to osteoarthritis or inflammatory arthritis) might cause pain but is less likely in a young patient with glucocorticoid exposure.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Avascular necrosis of the femoral head)**:  
  - **Correct**. Glucocorticoids are a leading cause of avascular necrosis, especially in the femoral head. The patient’s hip pain with weight-bearing and motion aligns with this diagnosis. Avascular necrosis often presents as groin or thigh pain worsened by activity.  
- **Option 2 (Herniated nucleus pulposus)**:  
  - **Incorrect**. HNP typically causes radicular leg pain (e.g., sciatica) with neurologic findings (e.g., weakness, numbness). The absence of neurologic deficits (normal neuro exam) and focal hip pain make this less likely.  
- **Option 3 (Narrowing of the hip joint)**:  
  - **Incorrect**. While glucocorticoids can cause osteoporosis or fractures, "narrowing of the hip joint" is nonspecific and could imply arthritis. However, the patient’s history and steroid use make avascular necrosis a more direct explanation.  
- **Option 4 (Osteoporosis)**:  
  - **Incorrect**. Osteoporosis increases fracture risk, but isolated hip pain without a history of trauma or fracture is less likely. Avascular necrosis is a more immediate complication of glucocorticoids in this context.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**  
Avascular necrosis of the femoral head is the most likely cause due to the patient’s 6-month history of glucocorticoid therapy, which is a well-established risk factor. The pain with weight-bearing and active/passive motion aligns with this diagnosis, and there is no evidence supporting the other options (e.g., neurologic deficits for HNP or trauma for osteoporosis-related fractures).

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks for the most likely cause of weight-bearing leg pain in a patient with sarcoidosis on long-term glucocorticoid therapy. Key elements include chronic steroid use, hip pain exacerbated by movement, and distinguishing between bone/joint pathologies.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Glucocorticoid side effects**: Long-term use is strongly associated with **avascular necrosis (AVN)** due to impaired blood supply to bone and **osteoporosis** due to reduced bone density.  
- **AVN of the femoral head**: Presents with progressive hip/groin pain worsened by weight-bearing and joint motion. Pain occurs with both active (patient-initiated) and passive (examiner-induced) movement, indicating intra-articular pathology.  
- **Osteoporosis**: Causes fragility fractures (e.g., vertebral, hip) but typically requires trauma or stress to manifest as acute pain.  
- **Herniated disc**: Unlikely here due to normal neurologic exam and absence of radicular symptoms.  
- **Hip joint narrowing (osteoarthritis)**: Less common in young patients unless secondary to AVN or trauma.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Avascular necrosis of the femoral head**  
  - **Correct**. Chronic glucocorticoid use is a major risk factor for AVN. Hip pain with active/passive range of motion strongly supports this diagnosis.  
- **Option 2: Herniated nucleus pulposus**  
  - **Incorrect**. No neurologic deficits (normal exam) or radicular pain to suggest nerve compression.  
- **Option 3: Narrowing of the hip joint**  
  - **Incorrect**. Secondary osteoarthritis from AVN could cause narrowing, but AVN itself is the primary pathology here.  
- **Option 4: Osteoporosis**  
  - **Incorrect**. While steroids cause osteoporosis, pain without evidence of fracture (e.g., imaging) is less likely.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The patient’s history of prolonged glucocorticoid use, hip pain with weight-bearing, and pain on both active/passive motion align with AVN of the femoral head. This is a well-documented complication of steroid therapy.  

**My final selection is: Option 1**
