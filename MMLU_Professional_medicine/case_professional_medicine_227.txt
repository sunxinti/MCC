问题: 
A 3-week-old male infant is brought to the office by his mother because of a 2-day history of white lesions in the mouth. The infant was born at term via uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal delivery; he has been breast-feeding well and is urinating and having bowel movements normally. At birth, he weighed 3289 g (7 lb 4 oz; 30th percentile). Today, he weighs 3629 kg (8 lb; 25th percentile). He appears adequately hydrated. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination discloses white patches on the tongue and buccal mucosa that do not come off when gently scraped with a tongue blade. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?
选项: 
1. Acyclovir
2. Fluconazole
3. Nystatin
4. Valacyclovir

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**
- **Clinical Scenario:** A 3-week-old male infant presents with white lesions in the mouth lasting for 2 days.
- **Key Features:**
  - Age: Neonate (3 weeks old)
  - Presentation: White patches on the tongue and buccal mucosa
  - Lesions do not scrape off
  - Otherwise healthy and well-hydrated
- **Question Objective:** Identify the most appropriate pharmacotherapy based on the clinical presentation.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**
- **Differential Diagnosis:** The white patches that do not scrape off are highly suggestive of oral thrush (oral candidiasis), a common fungal infection in infants.
- **Etiology:** Caused by the fungus *Candida albicans*.
- **Risk Factors:** Breastfeeding, antibiotic use, or immune system immaturity, though none are explicitly present here.
- **Treatment Principles:** 
  - Topical antifungal agents are first-line for mild to moderate cases.
  - Systemic antifungals are reserved for severe or refractory cases.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Acyclovir**
   - **Class:** Antiviral
   - **Use:** Primarily for herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections.
   - **Relevance:** Not appropriate for fungal infections like candidiasis.
   - **Conclusion:** Incorrect.

2. **Fluconazole**
   - **Class:** Systemic antifungal
   - **Use:** Used for more severe fungal infections or when topical treatment fails.
   - **Relevance:** While effective, it may be unnecessary as first-line therapy in this case.
   - **Conclusion:** Not the most appropriate first-line treatment.

3. **Nystatin**
   - **Class:** Topical antifungal
   - **Use:** First-line treatment for oral thrush in infants.
   - **Relevance:** Directly addresses the *Candida* infection in the oral cavity.
   - **Conclusion:** Appropriate and recommended as initial therapy.

4. **Valacyclovir**
   - **Class:** Antiviral
   - **Use:** Similar to acyclovir, used for HSV infections.
   - **Relevance:** Not suitable for fungal infections.
   - **Conclusion:** Incorrect.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question involves diagnosing and managing a common oral condition in a neonate. The key clinical findings are persistent white lesions in the mouth that do not scrape off, suggesting a specific infectious etiology. The goal is to identify the correct pharmacotherapy among antiviral and antifungal options.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Clinical Presentation:** White, non-blanching oral lesions in an infant are classic for **oral candidiasis** (thrush), caused by *Candida* species.  
- **Differential Diagnosis:**  
  - **Herpetic stomatitis** (HSV) typically presents with vesicles/ulcers and systemic symptoms (fever, irritability), which are absent here.  
  - **Milk residue** can mimic thrush but is easily wiped off.  
- **Treatment:**  
  - **First-line therapy for oral candidiasis in infants** is **topical antifungals** (e.g., nystatin).  
  - Systemic antifungals (e.g., fluconazole) are reserved for refractory or severe cases or immunocompromised patients.  
  - Antivirals (acyclovir/valacyclovir) are irrelevant unless HSV is confirmed.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Acyclovir):** Antiviral for HSV infections. Not indicated here, as HSV is unlikely given the lesion appearance and lack of systemic symptoms.  
- **Option 2 (Fluconazole):** Systemic azole antifungal. Effective for *Candida*, but **topical nystatin is first-line** for uncomplicated thrush in healthy infants.  
- **Option 3 (Nystatin):** Topical polyene antifungal. **Gold-standard treatment** for oral candidiasis in neonates due to safety and efficacy.  
- **Option 4 (Valacyclovir):** Prodrug of acyclovir; same rationale as Option 1 (antiviral, not indicated here).  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  

The white, non-scrapable oral lesions in this otherwise healthy neonate are diagnostic of **oral candidiasis**. **Nystatin** is the first-line treatment due to its topical application, safety profile, and effectiveness in uncomplicated cases. Fluconazole (Option 2) is systemic and reserved for refractory cases. Antivirals (Options 1 and 4) are irrelevant here.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks for the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for a 3-week-old infant with white, adherent oral lesions. Key clinical clues include the lesions' resistance to scraping, normal growth, and absence of systemic symptoms, pointing toward a localized fungal infection.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Oral Candidiasis (Thrush):** Common in infants, characterized by white plaques on the tongue/buccal mucosa that cannot be scraped off. Caused by *Candida albicans*.  
- **Diagnostic Clues:** Adherent plaques differentiate thrush from milk residue (easily scraped). Lack of vesicles/ulcers or systemic symptoms makes herpes unlikely.  
- **Treatment Principles:** Topical antifungals (e.g., nystatin) are first-line for uncomplicated thrush. Systemic antifungals (e.g., fluconazole) are reserved for refractory or systemic infections. Antivirals (acyclovir, valacyclovir) target herpes, which is not supported by the clinical presentation.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Acyclovir) & 4 (Valacyclovir):** Incorrect. These treat herpes simplex virus infections, which present with vesicles, ulcers, or systemic signs (none present here).  
- **Option 2 (Fluconazole):** Systemic antifungal. Effective but typically used for severe, recurrent, or disseminated candidiasis. Not first-line for localized thrush in an otherwise healthy infant.  
- **Option 3 (Nystatin):** Correct. Topical antifungal (oral suspension) is standard first-line therapy for uncomplicated oral thrush. Directly targets *Candida* with minimal systemic absorption, making it safe and effective for infants.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  
Nystatin is the most appropriate choice for localized, uncomplicated oral candidiasis in this infant. It aligns with first-line treatment guidelines, while systemic antifungals and antivirals are not indicated based on the clinical scenario.
