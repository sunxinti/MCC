问题: 
A 9-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of progressive weakness and a purple-red discoloration over his cheeks and upper eyelids over the past 8 weeks. His symptoms began shortly after a camping trip, and he now is unable to climb stairs, walk long distances, comb his hair, or dress himself. His mother says that she was careful to apply his sunscreen on the trip and can recall no tick bites or exposure to poisonous plants. His only medication is a topical corticosteroid for several dry, scaly patches of the skin. He appears weak and lethargic. He is at the 75th percentile for height and 25th percentile for weight; he has had no change in his weight since his last examination 9 months ago. His temperature is 37.7°C (99.8°F), blood pressure is 110/68 mm Hg, pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 28/min. Examination of the skin shows a purple-red discoloration over the cheeks and eyelids, periorbital edema, erythematous plaques and scales over the elbows and knees, and flat-topped red papules over all knuckles. There is generalized weakness and atrophy of the proximal muscles. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
选项: 
1. Dermatomyositis
2. Duchenne's muscular dystrophy
3. Eczema
4. Lyme disease

**1. Question Analysis**
- The question presents a clinical scenario of a 9-year-old boy with progressive muscle weakness and distinctive skin discoloration. It asks for the most likely diagnosis based on the symptoms, history, and examination findings.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**
- **Progressive Muscle Weakness:** Suggests a neuromuscular disorder, particularly affecting proximal muscles.
- **Skin Findings:**
  - Purple-red discoloration over cheeks and upper eyelids (heliotrope rash).
  - Periorbital edema.
  - Erythematous plaques and scales over elbows and knees (Gottron's papules).
  - Flat-topped red papules over knuckles.
- **Onset and Progression:** Symptoms developed over 8 weeks, indicating a subacute process.
- **Differential Diagnoses:**
  - **Dermatomyositis:** Characterized by muscle weakness and specific skin manifestations.
  - **Duchenne's Muscular Dystrophy:** Typically presents in younger males with progressive muscle weakness, mainly affecting lower limbs, without specific skin changes.
  - **Eczema:** Primarily a dermatological condition with pruritic, inflamed skin but without muscle weakness.
  - **Lyme Disease:** Associated with tick bites, erythema migrans, and systemic symptoms but lacks the specific muscle and skin findings described.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Dermatomyositis**
   - **Correct.** This condition presents with both proximal muscle weakness and characteristic skin rashes such as heliotrope rash and Gottron's papules, matching the patient's presentation.
2. **Duchenne's Muscular Dystrophy**
   - **Incorrect.** While it involves progressive muscle weakness, it typically presents earlier in childhood and lacks the distinctive skin findings observed.
3. **Eczema**
   - **Incorrect.** Eczema involves skin inflammation and itching but does not cause muscle weakness or the specific rashes described.
4. **Lyme Disease**
   - **Incorrect.** Although it can present with muscle and joint pain, the absence of tick exposure and the specific skin lesions make this diagnosis unlikely.

**4. Final Selection**

**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question requires identifying the most likely diagnosis in a child presenting with progressive muscle weakness, characteristic skin findings (purple-red discoloration over cheeks/eyelids, periorbital edema, erythematous plaques, and flat-topped papules on knuckles), and systemic signs (elevated temperature, respiratory rate). The key is linking the skin and muscle symptoms to a specific inflammatory or genetic disorder.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Dermatomyositis**: A chronic inflammatory myopathy characterized by muscle weakness, heliotrope rash (purple-red discoloration over the eyelids/cheeks), Gottron's papules (flat-topped erythematous papules on the knuckles), periorbital edema, and proximal muscle atrophy. Often associated with systemic involvement (e.g., interstitial lung disease).  
- **Duchenne’s Muscular Dystrophy**: A genetic disorder causing progressive muscle weakness, typically presenting before age 5, with Gower’s sign, calf hypertrophy, elevated creatine kinase (CK), and absence of skin findings.  
- **Eczema**: Chronic inflammatory skin condition with dry, scaly patches but no muscle weakness or characteristic dermatomyositis-associated skin lesions.  
- **Lyme Disease**: Caused by *Borrelia burgdorferi*; presents with erythema migrans (bull’s-eye rash), arthritis, or neurological symptoms. The skin findings here do not match Lyme’s typical rash, and muscle weakness is not a hallmark.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Dermatomyositis):**  
  - The heliotrope rash, Gottron’s papules, periorbital edema, and progressive proximal muscle weakness strongly point to dermatomyositis. The absence of tick bites or Lyme-specific rash (erythema migrans) makes Lyme disease less likely. The skin lesions are classic for dermatomyositis and not explained by eczema or Duchenne’s.  
- **Option 2 (Duchenne’s Muscular Dystrophy):**  
  - Typically presents in early childhood (before age 5), with calf hypertrophy, Gower’s sign, and elevated CK. The skin findings and age (9 years) make this unlikely.  
- **Option 3 (Eczema):**  
  - Eczema causes dry, scaly skin but no muscle weakness or the specific skin lesions described (Gottron’s papules, heliotrope rash).  
- **Option 4 (Lyme Disease):**  
  - Requires a tick bite or exposure history, and the rash described (purple-red discoloration, Gottron’s papules) does not match Lyme’s erythema migrans. Muscle weakness is not a primary feature.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**  

The combination of characteristic skin findings (heliotrope rash, Gottron’s papules, periorbital edema) and progressive proximal muscle weakness is pathognomonic for dermatomyositis. Other options lack the critical skin and systemic features described in the case.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question requires identifying the diagnosis in a pediatric patient presenting with progressive proximal muscle weakness and characteristic cutaneous findings, including a heliotrope rash, Gottron’s papules, and erythematous plaques. Key considerations include distinguishing inflammatory myopathies, genetic muscular disorders, infectious etiologies, and dermatologic conditions.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Dermatomyositis (DM):** An idiopathic inflammatory myopathy with hallmark features of symmetric proximal muscle weakness, heliotrope rash (purple-red discoloration on eyelids), Gottron’s papules/plaques (violaceous, scaly lesions over knuckles/extensor surfaces), and systemic inflammation. Periorbital edema and muscle atrophy are common.  
- **Duchenne’s Muscular Dystrophy (DMD):** X-linked recessive disorder causing progressive muscle degeneration. Presents earlier (age 3–5) with calf pseudohypertrophy, Gower’s sign, and absence of skin lesions.  
- **Eczema:** Chronic pruritic dermatitis with erythematous, scaly patches. No muscle involvement.  
- **Lyme Disease:** Tick-borne infection with erythema migrans (bull’s-eye rash) and potential for arthritis/neurologic symptoms. No proximal myopathy or Gottron’s lesions.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Dermatomyositis**  
  - **Correct.** The heliotrope rash, periorbital edema, Gottron’s papules (flat-topped lesions on knuckles), and proximal muscle weakness/atrophy are pathognomonic. Fever, tachycardia, and elevated respirations align with systemic inflammation.  
- **Option 2: Duchenne’s Muscular Dystrophy**  
  - **Incorrect.** Onset at age 9 is atypical for DMD. Absence of calf pseudohypertrophy/Gower’s sign and presence of skin findings exclude this diagnosis.  
- **Option 3: Eczema**  
  - **Incorrect.** Topical corticosteroid use explains dry/scaly patches but does not account for muscle weakness or specific rashes (heliotrope, Gottron’s).  
- **Option 4: Lyme Disease**  
  - **Incorrect.** Lack of tick exposure, erythema migrans, or arthritis makes this unlikely. Muscle weakness in Lyme is not proximal or accompanied by dermatomyositis-specific rashes.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The patient’s clinical features—proximal muscle weakness, heliotrope rash, Gottron’s papules, and periorbital edema—are diagnostic of dermatomyositis. No other option accounts for both the cutaneous and muscular manifestations.  

**My final selection is: Option 1**
