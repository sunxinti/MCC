问题:

Genetic studies show a single gene deletion. The man has microcytic anemia and a two-gene deletion. If the two-gene deletion is in trans (one deletion on the maternal gene and one deletion on the paternal gene), which of the following percentages of their offspring will have a two-gene deletion?
选项: 
1. 0%
2. 25%
3. 50%
4. 75%

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question assesses the inheritance pattern of α-thalassemia when both parents carry deletions in the α-globin genes. Specifically, it examines the probability of their offspring inheriting a two-gene deletion based on the parents' genetic configurations.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **α-Thalassemia Genetics**: α-Thalassemia is typically caused by deletions in the α-globin genes located on chromosome 16. Each individual has four α-globin genes (two on each chromosome). 
- **Genetic Inheritance Patterns**: 
  - **Single Gene Deletion (–α/αα)**: Individuals with one deleted α-globin gene are carriers and usually exhibit minimal or no symptoms.
  - **Two-Gene Deletion in Trans (–α/–α)**: When deletions occur on different chromosomes (trans configuration), individuals have a more significant reduction in α-globin production, leading to microcytic anemia.
- **Punnett Square Application**: To determine the probability of offspring inheriting specific gene deletions, a Punnett square can be used based on parental genotypes.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: 0%**
  - **Incorrect**. Given that both parents carry deletions, there is a possibility for offspring to inherit multiple deletions.
  
- **Option 2: 25%**
  - **Incorrect**. This would imply a lower probability than what genetic inheritance predicts in this scenario.
  
- **Option 3: 50%**
  - **Correct**. 
    - **Parental Genotypes**:
      - **Woman**: –α/αα (can pass on –α or α)
      - **Man**: –α/–α (can only pass on –α)
    - **Possible Offspring**:
      - 50% chance of inheriting –α from both parents (–α/–α)
      - 50% chance of inheriting –α from the father and α from the mother (–α/α)
    - Therefore, there's a 50% probability that the offspring will have a two-gene deletion (–α/–α).
  
- **Option 4: 75%**
  - **Incorrect**. This overestimates the probability based on the given genetic configurations.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks for the percentage of offspring who will have a two-gene deletion for α-thalassemia, given the parents' genotypes. The key concepts involve understanding α-thalassemia genetics, inheritance patterns (cis vs. trans deletions), and Mendelian principles.  

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **α-Thalassemia Genetics**: Alpha-globin genes are located on chromosome 16, with two genes (HBA1 and HBA2) per chromosome. Deletions reduce the number of functional genes.  
- **Deletion Types**:  
  - **Cis deletion**: Both deletions occur on the same chromosome.  
  - **Trans deletion**: Deletions occur on separate chromosomes (one from each parent).  
- **Parental Genotypes**:  
  - The woman has a single deletion (e.g., `-α/αα`), making her a carrier.  
  - The man has a two-gene deletion in trans (`-α/-α`), meaning each chromosome contributes one deletion.  
- **Gamete Contribution**:  
  - The woman can pass `-α` (50%) or `αα` (50%).  
  - The man can only pass `-α` (since both chromosomes have one deletion each).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (0%)**: Incorrect. The man’s trans deletions ensure all his gametes carry one deletion. When combined with the woman’s possible `-α` gamete (50%), offspring can inherit two deletions.  
- **Option 2 (25%)**: Incorrect. This would apply if the man had a cis deletion (e.g., `--/αα`), but his trans deletions mean all gametes carry a single deletion.  
- **Option 3 (50%)**: Correct. The woman has a 50% chance of passing `-α`, combining with the man’s `-α` to yield two deletions.  
- **Option 4 (75%)**: Incorrect. This would require the man to have a higher likelihood of passing deletions, but his trans deletions only allow one deletion per gamete.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  

The man’s trans deletions ensure all his gametes carry one deleted chromosome. The woman has a 50% chance of passing her `-α` chromosome, resulting in a 50% chance of offspring inheriting two deletions.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks about the probability of offspring inheriting a two-gene deletion in α-thalassemia when one parent has a single-gene deletion and the other has a two-gene deletion in trans. This requires understanding autosomal recessive inheritance patterns and gene configurations in α-thalassemia.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **α-Thalassemia Genetics**: Each individual has four α-globin genes (two on each chromosome 16). Deletions can occur in one (α⁺) or both (α⁰) genes on a chromosome.  
- **Parental Genotypes**:  
  - **Woman**: Single-gene deletion (αα/α⁻, three total genes).  
  - **Man**: Two-gene deletion in trans (α⁻/α⁻, two total genes).  
- **Gamete Formation**:  
  - The man can only pass a chromosome with one gene (α⁻).  
  - The woman has a 50% chance of passing a normal chromosome (αα) or a deleted chromosome (α⁻).  
- **Offspring Outcomes**:  
  - 50%: Inherit αα (from mother) + α⁻ (from father) → **three genes (one deletion)**.  
  - 50%: Inherit α⁻ (from mother) + α⁻ (from father) → **two genes (two deletions in trans)**.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (0%)**: Incorrect. Half the offspring inherit two deletions (α⁻/α⁻).  
- **Option 2 (25%)**: Incorrect. Independent assortment does not reduce the probability to 25%.  
- **Option 3 (50%)**: Correct. 50% of offspring inherit one deleted chromosome from each parent.  
- **Option 4 (75%)**: Incorrect. No scenario produces three-quarters of offspring with two deletions.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The probability of offspring inheriting a two-gene deletion in trans is 50%, as half receive a deleted chromosome from both parents.  

**My final selection is: Option 3**
