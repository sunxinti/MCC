问题: 
A healthy 22-year-old man participates in a study of glucose metabolism. At the beginning of the study, his serum glucose concentration is within the reference range. He consumes an 800-calorie meal consisting of protein, fat, and carbohydrates. He then sleeps through the night without additional food or drink. Twelve hours later, his serum glucose concentration remains within the reference range. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely involved in maintaining this man's serum glucose concentration?
选项: 
1. Continued gut absorption of calories from the ingested meal
2. Glucose release from skeletal muscle
3. Glycogenolysis in the liver
4. Increased leptin release from adipose tissues

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question examines the physiological mechanisms that maintain serum glucose levels in a healthy individual during a fasting state. Specifically, it focuses on the body's ability to sustain normal blood glucose concentrations 12 hours after consuming a meal, without additional intake of food or drink.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
Maintaining blood glucose levels during fasting involves several metabolic processes:

- **Glycogenolysis in the liver:** The primary mechanism for maintaining blood glucose during short-term fasting (up to about 12-16 hours) is the breakdown of glycogen stored in the liver into glucose.
  
- **Gluconeogenesis:** As fasting continues beyond glycogen stores, the liver synthesizes glucose from non-carbohydrate sources like amino acids and glycerol.
  
- **Insulin and Glucagon Regulation:** After a meal, insulin levels rise to facilitate glucose uptake. During fasting, glucagon levels increase to promote glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis.
  
- **Role of Other Tissues:** Skeletal muscle stores glycogen but lacks the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase, making it unable to release free glucose into the bloodstream. Adipose tissue releases fatty acids but is not directly involved in glucose maintenance.

**3. Analysis of Options**

1. **Continued gut absorption of calories from the ingested meal:**  
   - **Incorrect.** After consuming an 800-calorie meal and then fasting overnight, there is no continued absorption of calories from the gut. Absorption occurs shortly after meal ingestion, not during the fasting period.

2. **Glucose release from skeletal muscle:**  
   - **Incorrect.** Skeletal muscle stores glucose as glycogen but cannot release free glucose into the bloodstream because it lacks the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase necessary for this process.

3. **Glycogenolysis in the liver:**  
   - **Correct.** Liver glycogenolysis is the primary mechanism for maintaining blood glucose levels during short-term fasting periods, such as the 12-hour overnight fast described.

4. **Increased leptin release from adipose tissues:**  
   - **Incorrect.** Leptin is involved in regulating appetite and energy balance but does not play a direct role in maintaining blood glucose levels during fasting.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question examines mechanisms maintaining serum glucose levels during a 12-hour fasting period after a mixed meal. The key is identifying which physiological process compensates for the absence of exogenous glucose intake while preserving normoglycemia.  

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Glucose homeostasis during fasting**: After a meal, glucose comes from digestion. During fasting, the body relies on **glycogenolysis** (breakdown of glycogen to glucose, primarily in the liver) and **gluconeogenesis** (synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrate precursors) to maintain blood glucose.  
- **Role of organs**:  
  - **Liver**: Primary site for glycogen storage and release (glycogenolysis) and gluconeogenesis.  
  - **Skeletal muscle**: Stores glycogen but does not release glucose into circulation.  
  - **Adipose tissue**: Stores fat and releases fatty acids/glycerol (substrates for gluconeogenesis) but does not directly release glucose.  
- **Leptin**: Hormone produced by adipose tissue signaling satiety but does not directly regulate glucose levels.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Continued gut absorption**  
  Unlikely. Gut absorption of nutrients typically ceases within hours after a meal. After 12 hours, no significant absorption would persist.  

- **Option 2: Glucose release from skeletal muscle**  
  Incorrect. Skeletal muscle glycogen is an energy reserve for the muscle itself and is not released into the bloodstream. The liver is the only organ that releases glucose systemically.  

- **Option 3: Glycogenolysis in the liver**  
  Correct. The liver’s glycogen stores are the primary source of glucose during short-term fasting (hours to days). Glycogenolysis breaks down liver glycogen into glucose, maintaining serum glucose levels.  

- **Option 4: Increased leptin release from adipose tissues**  
  Irrelevant. Leptin regulates appetite and energy expenditure but does not directly contribute to glucose production or release.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  

Glycogenolysis in the liver is the most accurate answer because it is the primary mechanism by which the body maintains serum glucose levels during fasting. The liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose, ensuring normoglycemia when exogenous glucose intake ceases. Other options are either physiologically implausible (continued gut absorption, skeletal muscle glucose release) or unrelated to direct glucose regulation (leptin).

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question examines the physiological mechanisms maintaining serum glucose levels during fasting in a healthy individual after a meal. Key concepts include glucose regulation, glycogen storage/utilization, and hormonal responses during fasting.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- After a meal, glucose is absorbed, stored as glycogen (primarily in liver and muscle), and regulated by insulin.  
- During fasting, insulin decreases, glucagon increases, triggering glycogenolysis (glycogen breakdown) in the liver to release glucose into the bloodstream.  
- Skeletal muscle lacks glucose-6-phosphatase, preventing glucose release into blood.  
- Gut absorption typically completes within 4–6 hours post-meal.  
- Leptin regulates long-term energy balance, not acute glucose homeostasis.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Continued gut absorption):** Incorrect. Gut absorption of an 800-calorie meal would conclude within 6 hours, not persisting for 12 hours.  
- **Option 2 (Glucose release from skeletal muscle):** Incorrect. Muscle glycogen is used locally; skeletal muscle cannot release free glucose due to the absence of glucose-6-phosphatase.  
- **Option 3 (Glycogenolysis in the liver):** Correct. The liver maintains blood glucose via glycogenolysis during early fasting. Even after 12 hours, residual liver glycogen may still contribute, especially after a carbohydrate-containing meal.  
- **Option 4 (Increased leptin release):** Incorrect. Leptin decreases during fasting and does not directly regulate acute glucose levels.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  
The liver’s glycogenolysis is the primary mechanism maintaining glucose levels during the initial 12-hour fasting period. While gluconeogenesis becomes significant later, the question specifies a healthy individual with glucose still within reference range, aligning with glycogenolysis as the most immediate and relevant process.
