**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question pertains to renal physiology, specifically the dynamics within the glomeruli of the kidney. It focuses on understanding how constricting the efferent arteriole affects the Starling forces, which govern fluid exchange during glomerular filtration.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Starling Forces in the Glomerulus:** These include glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure (P_gc), Bowman's space hydrostatic pressure (P_bs), and glomerular capillary oncotic pressure (π_gc). The net filtration pressure is determined by the balance of these forces.
- **Afferent and Efferent Arterioles:** The afferent arteriole supplies blood to the glomerulus, while the efferent arteriole drains it. Constriction of the efferent arteriole increases resistance to outflow.
- **Impact of Efferent Arteriole Constriction:** Increasing resistance at the efferent arteriole elevates the hydrostatic pressure within the glomerular capillaries (P_gc), thereby influencing the net filtration pressure.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Decreased filtration coefficient (Kf):**  
   - **Analysis:** Kf is a measure of the kidney's ability to filter blood, dependent on permeability and surface area. Constricting the efferent arteriole primarily affects pressure, not the permeability or surface area.
   - **Conclusion:** Incorrect.

2. **Decreased hydrostatic pressure:**  
   - **Analysis:** Constricting the efferent arteriole increases resistance to blood flow out of the glomerulus, leading to elevated hydrostatic pressure within the glomerular capillaries.
   - **Conclusion:** Incorrect.

3. **Decreased oncotic pressure:**  
   - **Analysis:** Oncotic pressure is influenced by plasma protein concentration. Restricting efferent arteriolar outflow may lead to hemoconcentration, potentially increasing rather than decreasing oncotic pressure.
   - **Conclusion:** Incorrect.

4. **Increased hydrostatic pressure:**  
   - **Analysis:** As blood faces increased resistance exiting through the constricted efferent arteriole, hydrostatic pressure within the glomerulus rises.
   - **Conclusion:** Correct.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question examines the effects of constricting the efferent arteriole on Starling forces in the glomerulus. Starling forces include hydrostatic and oncotic pressures in the glomerular capillaries, which determine net filtration pressure.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Glomerular Hydrodynamics**:  
  - The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) depends on the balance of Starling forces.  
  - **Hydrostatic pressure in glomerular capillaries (Pgc)** is determined by afferent arterial pressure minus resistance in the efferent arteriole.  
  - **Oncotic pressure (πgc)** in the capillaries is influenced by plasma protein concentration.  
  - Constricting the efferent arteriole increases resistance to blood flow out of the glomerulus, raising Pgc.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Decreased filtration coefficient (Kf))**:  
  - Kf depends on capillary permeability and surface area. Constricting the efferent arteriole does not directly alter capillary permeability or surface area (unless structural damage occurs, which is not implied here). **Incorrect**.  

- **Option 2 (Decreased hydrostatic pressure)**:  
  - Constricting the efferent arteriole *increases* glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure (Pgc), not decreases it. **Incorrect**.  

- **Option 3 (Decreased oncotic pressure)**:  
  - Oncotic pressure in the glomerular capillaries is primarily determined by plasma protein concentration, which remains unchanged in the short term. **Incorrect**.  

- **Option 4 (Increased hydrostatic pressure)**:  
  - Constricting the efferent arteriole increases resistance to blood flow out of the glomerulus. With constant afferent pressure (100 mm Hg), this raises Pgc. This directly impacts the Starling forces. **Correct**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question examines how efferent arteriole constriction alters Starling forces (hydrostatic and oncotic pressures) in glomeruli under constant afferent arterial pressure. The goal is to identify which force changes immediately.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Starling Forces in Glomerular Filtration:**  
  - Glomerular hydrostatic pressure (PGC): Primary force driving filtration.  
  - Glomerular oncotic pressure (πGC): Opposes filtration (increases as plasma proteins concentrate).  
  - Bowman's space hydrostatic and oncotic pressures are negligible.  
- **Efferent Arteriole Constriction:**  
  - Increases resistance downstream, raising PGC (due to reduced outflow).  
  - Plasma oncotic pressure (πGC) increases *over time* as more fluid filters out, concentrating proteins. However, this is a secondary, delayed effect.  
  - Filtration coefficient (Kf) relates to capillary permeability/surface area, not a Starling force.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Decreased Kf):** Incorrect. Kf is not a Starling force. Efferent constriction may distend capillaries, potentially increasing surface area, but this is unrelated to immediate Starling force changes.  
- **Option 2 (Decreased Hydrostatic Pressure):** Incorrect. Efferent constriction elevates PGC by impeding outflow.  
- **Option 3 (Decreased Oncotic Pressure):** Incorrect. πGC increases as filtration progresses, but this is delayed. Immediate changes in πGC are negligible.  
- **Option 4 (Increased Hydrostatic Pressure):** Correct. Efferent constriction directly raises PGC by increasing resistance, altering this Starling force immediately.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The immediate effect of efferent arteriole constriction is a rise in glomerular hydrostatic pressure (PGC), making **Option 4** the correct answer.  

**My final selection is: Option 4**
