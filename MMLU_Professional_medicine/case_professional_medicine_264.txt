问题: 
An 18-year-old primigravid woman comes for her initial prenatal visit at 16 weeks' gestation. She is not sure about the date of her last menstrual period but says that the pregnancy probably occurred immediately after she stopped taking oral contraceptives 5 months ago. Maternal serum α-fetoprotein (MSAFP) concentration is increased to 3 multiples of the median. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
选项: 
1. Repeat measurement of MSAFP concentration
2. Triple screening for MSAFP, serum β-hCG, and serum estriol concentrations
3. Ultrasonography
4. Amniocentesis for measurement of α-fetoprotein concentration

**1. Question Analysis**
- The question pertains to prenatal screening protocols, specifically addressing the management of an elevated maternal serum α-fetoprotein (MSAFP) level. The patient is a primigravid woman at 16 weeks' gestation with an MSAFP level three times the median. The question seeks to determine the most appropriate next step in the management of this finding.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**
- **Maternal Serum α-Fetoprotein (MSAFP):** MSAFP is a screening test typically performed between 16-18 weeks of gestation. Elevated levels can be associated with neural tube defects (e.g., spina bifida, anencephaly), abdominal wall defects, multiple gestations, or inaccurate dating of the pregnancy.
- **Implications of Elevated MSAFP:** An MSAFP level >2.5 multiples of the median (MoM) is considered elevated. This elevation necessitates further evaluation to rule out fetal anomalies or confirm gestational dating.
- **Next Steps After Elevated MSAFP:** The primary next step is to perform a detailed ultrasonography to assess fetal anatomy and confirm gestational age. If structural anomalies are suspected, further diagnostic testing such as amniocentesis may be considered.

**3. Analysis of Options**

1. **Repeat measurement of MSAFP concentration**
   - *Evaluation:* Repeating MSAFP is not the most appropriate initial step when levels are significantly elevated. The focus should shift to diagnostic evaluation rather than mere repetition of the screening test.
   - *Conclusion:* Incorrect.

2. **Triple screening for MSAFP, serum β-hCG, and serum estriol concentrations**
   - *Evaluation:* Triple screening is a form of first-tier screening. Since the MSAFP is already elevated, additional screening tests do not address the immediate concern and may delay necessary diagnostic evaluations.
   - *Conclusion:* Incorrect.

3. **Ultrasonography**
   - *Evaluation:* Ultrasonography is the appropriate next step after an elevated MSAFP level. It helps in confirming gestational age, detecting multiple gestations, and identifying fetal structural anomalies such as neural tube defects.
   - *Conclusion:* Correct.

4. **Amniocentesis for measurement of α-fetoprotein concentration**
   - *Evaluation:* Amniocentesis is an invasive diagnostic procedure typically considered after ultrasound findings suggestive of anomalies. It is not the immediate next step solely based on elevated MSAFP.
   - *Conclusion:* Incorrect.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question involves managing an elevated maternal serum α-fetoprotein (MSAFP) result in a primigravid woman at 16 weeks' gestation. Key considerations include the clinical significance of elevated MSAFP, potential causes (e.g., neural tube defects, gestational age miscalculation), and appropriate next diagnostic steps.  

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Elevated MSAFP**: Indicates increased risk of neural tube defects (e.g., spina bifida), abdominal wall defects, multiple gestations, or gestational age miscalculation.  
- **Gestational Age Uncertainty**: The patient’s uncertainty about her last menstrual period and reliance on contraceptive discontinuation timing complicates accurate dating.  
- **Diagnostic Approach**: The initial response to an abnormal MSAFP is confirming gestational age via **ultrasonography** to rule out miscalculation. Ultrasound also evaluates fetal anatomy for structural defects.  
- **Triple Screen**: Combines AFP, β-hCG, and estriol but is typically part of first-trimester screening or used if MSAFP alone is abnormal but gestational age is confirmed.  
- **Amniocentesis**: Invasive and reserved for cases with confirmed anatomical abnormalities or high-risk genetic conditions after non-invasive evaluation.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Repeat MSAFP)**: Unlikely to resolve gestational age uncertainty or anatomical issues. MSAFP levels are gestation-dependent; repeating without confirming dating is redundant. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 2 (Triple screening)**: Adds β-hCG and estriol but does not address gestational age or anatomical defects. Triple screening is unnecessary if the primary concern is elevated AFP. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 3 (Ultrasonography)**: Critical first step to confirm gestational age and assess fetal anatomy. Adjusts AFP interpretation if dating is incorrect and identifies structural defects (e.g., neural tube defects). **Correct**.  
- **Option 4 (Amniocentesis)**: Invasive and not indicated until structural abnormalities are confirmed via ultrasound. Reserved for high-risk scenarios after imaging. **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  

**Explanation**: Ultrasonography is the most appropriate next step. It addresses gestational age uncertainty (a common cause of false-positive MSAFP results) and evaluates for anatomical defects. This non-invasive approach is standard in managing elevated MSAFP before considering more invasive tests like amniocentesis.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question involves determining the appropriate next step in managing a pregnant patient with an elevated maternal serum α-fetoprotein (MSAFP) level (3 multiples of the median) at 16 weeks’ gestation. Key considerations include evaluating potential causes of elevated MSAFP, addressing uncertainty in gestational dating, and selecting the most effective diagnostic follow-up.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Elevated MSAFP** is associated with neural tube defects (NTDs), abdominal wall defects, incorrect gestational dating, multiple gestations, or placental abnormalities.  
- **Gestational dating accuracy** is critical, as MSAFP levels are gestational age-dependent. An overestimated gestational age (i.e., the fetus is younger than calculated) can falsely elevate MSAFP.  
- **Ultrasonography** is the gold standard for confirming gestational age, identifying structural anomalies (e.g., NTDs), and detecting multiple pregnancies.  
- **Amniocentesis** measures amniotic fluid α-fetoprotein and acetylcholinesterase for definitive diagnosis of NTDs but is invasive and not first-line.  
- **Triple screening** (adding β-hCG and estriol) primarily assesses Down syndrome risk (linked to low AFP, low estriol, and high β-hCG) but does not address elevated MSAFP.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Repeat MSAFP):** Unreliable without confirming gestational age first. Repeating without addressing dating errors risks misinterpretation. **Incorrect.**  
- **Option 2 (Triple screening):** Focuses on aneuploidy risk, not the elevated AFP. Does not resolve the primary concern (NTDs or dating error). **Incorrect.**  
- **Option 3 (Ultrasonography):** Confirms gestational age, rules out structural anomalies (e.g., NTDs), and identifies multiple gestations. Essential before proceeding to invasive tests. **Correct.**  
- **Option 4 (Amniocentesis):** Invasive and carries miscarriage risk. Reserved for cases where ultrasound is inconclusive. Not first-line. **Incorrect.**  

**4. Final Selection**  
The most appropriate next step is **ultrasonography** to confirm gestational age and evaluate for structural abnormalities, which directly addresses the elevated MSAFP and avoids unnecessary invasive procedures.  

**My final selection is: Option 3**
