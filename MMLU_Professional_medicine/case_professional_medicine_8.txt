问题: 
A 51-year-old man comes to the office because of a 6-month history of a lump on his tongue that is interfering with his speech and eating; he also has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss during this period. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily and has consumed six 12-oz bottles of beer on weekend nights during the past 30 years. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a 1.5-cm mass on the apex of the tongue. Further evaluation of the mass confirms squamous cell carcinoma. It is most appropriate to evaluate which of the following lymph nodes first for evidence of metastasis in this patient?
选项: 
1. Inferior deep cervical
2. Parotid
3. Retropharyngeal
4. Submental

**1. Question Analysis**
- The question presents a clinical scenario of a 51-year-old male with a squamous cell carcinoma located at the apex of the tongue. It inquires about the most appropriate lymph node group to evaluate first for potential metastasis.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**
- **Anatomy of Tongue Lymphatic Drainage:** The tongue has a rich lymphatic network. The apex (tip) of the tongue primarily drains into the submandibular and upper deep cervical lymph nodes. 
- **Metastasis Patterns in Squamous Cell Carcinoma:** Squamous cell carcinomas, especially in the oral cavity, frequently metastasize to regional lymph nodes before distant sites.
- **Lymph Node Groups:**
  - **Inferior Deep Cervical Nodes:** Located along the internal jugular vein; significant in head and neck cancers.
  - **Parotid Nodes:** Associated with the parotid gland; typically involved in cancers of the external ear, parotid gland itself, or distal parts of the oral cavity.
  - **Retropharyngeal Nodes:** Situated behind the pharynx; more commonly involved in nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal cancers.
  - **Submental Nodes:** Located under the chin; drain the central lower lip, floor of the mouth, and tip of the tongue.

**3. Analysis of Options**
- **Option 1: Inferior Deep Cervical**
  - While involved in drainage from the tongue, they are not the first group affected from the apex.
- **Option 2: Parotid**
  - Less likely to be the first site of metastasis for apex tongue cancers; more associated with other head and neck regions.
- **Option 3: Retropharyngeal**
  - Not typically the initial drainage site for tongue apex tumors.
- **Option 4: Submental**
  - Directly drains the tip of the tongue and is the primary lymph node group to assess for metastasis from the apex of the tongue.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which lymph node to evaluate first for metastasis in a patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue’s apex. Key considerations include understanding lymphatic drainage pathways of the tongue and the typical spread patterns of head and neck cancers.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Anatomy of Lymphatic Drainage of the Tongue:**  
  - The **anterior two-thirds** of the tongue (including the apex) primarily drain to the **submandibular lymph nodes** and **submental lymph nodes**.  
  - The **posterior third** of the tongue drains to the **deep cervical lymph nodes** (levels II–IV).  
- **Clinical Context:**  
  - The patient’s tumor is located at the **apex** (tip) of the tongue, which is part of the anterior two-thirds.  
  - Squamous cell carcinoma in this region commonly metastasizes to the submandibular/submental nodes first.  
  - The inferior deep cervical (level V), parotid, and retropharyngeal nodes are less likely to be the first sites of metastasis for anterior tongue tumors.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Inferior deep cervical):**  
  - These nodes (level V) drain the hypopharynx, larynx, and posterior tongue. Since the tumor is in the anterior tongue, this is less likely to be the first node involved. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 2 (Parotid):**  
  - Parotid lymph nodes drain the parotid gland and scalp. They are not part of the primary drainage pathway for the anterior tongue. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 3 (Retropharyngeal):**  
  - Retropharyngeal nodes drain the nasopharynx and posterior structures. Unrelated to anterior tongue tumors. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 4 (Submental):**  
  - The submental nodes are part of the primary drainage pathway for the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. This is the most appropriate first node to evaluate. **Correct**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which lymph nodes should be evaluated first for metastasis in a patient with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) located at the apex (tip) of the tongue. This requires understanding the lymphatic drainage patterns of the tongue and prioritizing the first-echelon nodes for metastasis.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- The lymphatic drainage of the tongue varies by region:  
  - **Apex (tip)**: Primarily drains to **submental lymph nodes** (level IA).  
  - **Anterior two-thirds (lateral aspects)**: Drains to submandibular (level IB) and upper deep cervical nodes (level II).  
  - **Posterior third (base)**: Drains to deep cervical (levels II/III) and retropharyngeal nodes.  
- SCC of the tongue typically metastasizes sequentially, starting with the first-echelon nodes closest to the tumor.  
- Inferior deep cervical (level IV) and retropharyngeal nodes are not initial drainage sites for the apex. Parotid nodes drain facial/salivary gland regions, not the tongue tip.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Inferior deep cervical (level IV)**  
  Located lower in the neck (below the cricoid cartilage). These are not first-echelon nodes for the tongue apex; metastasis here would indicate advanced disease. **Incorrect**.  

- **Option 2: Parotid**  
  Drains the parotid gland, external auditory canal, and adjacent scalp. Not involved in tongue apex drainage. **Incorrect**.  

- **Option 3: Retropharyngeal**  
  Associated with posterior pharyngeal tumors (e.g., nasopharyngeal carcinoma). Not a primary drainage site for the oral tongue. **Incorrect**.  

- **Option 4: Submental (level IA)**  
  The apex of the tongue drains first to the submental nodes, which are midline and located beneath the chin. These are the first-echelon nodes for this tumor location. **Correct**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The apex of the tongue primarily drains to the submental lymph nodes, making them the first site to evaluate for metastasis. Other options involve nodes that are either secondary or unrelated to the tongue tip’s lymphatic pathway.  

**My final selection is: Option 4**
