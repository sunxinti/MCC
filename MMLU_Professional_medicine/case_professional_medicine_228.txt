问题: 
A 45-year-old man comes to the physician because of right shoulder pain that began after he chopped wood 2 days ago. Examination of the right upper extremity shows no obvious bone deformities or point tenderness. The pain is reproduced when the patient is asked to externally rotate the shoulder against resistance; there is no weakness. In addition to the teres minor, inflammation of which of the following tendons is most likely in this patient?
选项: 
1. Infraspinatus
2. Pectoralis
3. Subscapularis
4. Supraspinatus

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**
- The question presents a clinical scenario of a 45-year-old man experiencing right shoulder pain following physical activity (chopping wood). The absence of bone deformities or point tenderness suggests a soft tissue injury rather than a fracture. Pain reproduction during external rotation against resistance implicates specific shoulder muscles or tendons. The question specifically asks which tendon, in addition to the teres minor, is most likely inflamed.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**
- **Rotator Cuff Anatomy**: The rotator cuff comprises four muscles: supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis. Each plays a role in shoulder movement and stability.
- **External Rotation Test**: This clinical test assesses the integrity of the external rotators, primarily the infraspinatus and teres minor. Pain or weakness during this maneuver suggests involvement of these muscles or their tendons.
- **Tendinitis**: Inflammation of the tendons can result from overuse or acute injury, leading to pain and functional impairment without necessarily causing muscle weakness.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Infraspinatus**
   - *Function*: Primary external rotator of the shoulder.
   - *Relevance*: Pain on external rotation against resistance suggests infraspinatus involvement alongside teres minor.
   - *Conclusion*: Likely correct.
2. **Pectoralis**
   - *Function*: Adducts and flexes the shoulder; not primarily involved in external rotation.
   - *Relevance*: Less likely to be implicated in pain from external rotation.
   - *Conclusion*: Incorrect.
3. **Subscapularis**
   - *Function*: Primary internal rotator of the shoulder.
   - *Relevance*: External rotation maneuvers assess external rotators, making subscapularis involvement unlikely.
   - *Conclusion*: Incorrect.
4. **Supraspinatus**
   - *Function*: Initiates abduction of the shoulder.
   - *Relevance*: While part of the rotator cuff, it is more involved in abduction rather than external rotation.
   - *Conclusion*: Less likely compared to infraspinatus.
   
**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question focuses on identifying the tendon, aside from the teres minor, that is most likely inflamed in a patient presenting with shoulder pain exacerbated by external rotation against resistance. This requires knowledge of shoulder anatomy, rotator cuff muscle functions, and clinical correlations of tendon inflammation (e.g., tendinitis).

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Rotator Cuff Muscles**: The rotator cuff comprises four muscles: supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis.  
  - **Supraspinatus**: Initiates abduction (lifting the arm away from the body).  
  - **Infraspinatus and Teres Minor**: Primary external rotators of the shoulder.  
  - **Subscapularis**: Primary internal rotator of the shoulder.  
- **Clinical Correlation**: Pain with external rotation suggests involvement of the infraspinatus or teres minor, as these muscles are responsible for this movement. Since the teres minor is already mentioned, the other likely candidate is the infraspinatus.  
- **Mechanism of Injury**: Repetitive overhead or rotational movements (e.g., chopping wood) can cause tendinitis in these muscles.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Infraspinatus)**:  
  - The infraspinatus is the primary external rotator of the shoulder. Pain with resisted external rotation strongly implicates this tendon. Since the question specifies "in addition to the teres minor," infraspinatus is the correct choice.  
- **Option 2 (Pectoralis)**:  
  - The pectoralis major is not part of the rotator cuff and primarily responsible for shoulder flexion and adduction. It does not contribute to external rotation, making this option incorrect.  
- **Option 3 (Subscapularis)**:  
  - The subscapularis is an internal rotator of the shoulder. Pain with external rotation would not involve this tendon, ruling it out.  
- **Option 4 (Supraspinatus)**:  
  - The supraspinatus is involved in abduction, not external rotation. Pain with this movement would not primarily involve the supraspinatus, making this incorrect.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**  

The infraspinatus is the most likely tendon inflamed because it, along with the teres minor, is responsible for external rotation of the shoulder. The patient’s pain during resisted external rotation aligns with tendinitis of these muscles. The other options are anatomically or functionally unrelated to the described clinical scenario.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question assesses knowledge of shoulder anatomy and rotator cuff pathology. It asks which tendon (besides teres minor) is inflamed when pain occurs during resisted external rotation without weakness.  

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Rotator cuff muscles**: Supraspinatus (initiates abduction), Infraspinatus (external rotation), Teres minor (external rotation), Subscapularis (internal rotation).  
- **Pain on resisted external rotation** specifically implicates the infraspinatus and teres minor, as these muscles drive this motion.  
- **Absence of weakness** suggests tendinitis rather than a full-thickness tear.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Infraspinatus**: Correct. It works synergistically with teres minor during external rotation. Resisted external rotation directly stresses its tendon.  
2. **Pectoralis**: Incorrect. The pectoralis major is not involved in external rotation; it facilitates adduction/internal rotation.  
3. **Subscapularis**: Incorrect. It mediates internal rotation (tested via resisted internal rotation or lift-off test).  
4. **Supraspinatus**: Incorrect. It is tested with resisted abduction (e.g., "empty can" test), not external rotation.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**  
The infraspinatus tendon is the primary driver of external rotation alongside the teres minor. Pain during this maneuver without weakness aligns with tendinitis of these structures. Other options are anatomically unrelated to the described mechanism.
