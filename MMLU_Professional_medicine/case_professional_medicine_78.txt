问题: 
A new blood test to detect prostate cancer is evaluated in 300 male volunteers. A needle biopsy of the prostate gland is done on all men with serum prostate-specific antigen concentrations greater than 5 ng/mL (N<4). One hundred men undergo biopsy procedures; 90 are found to have prostate cancer, and five are found to have chronic prostatitis. Which of the following is necessary to calculate the sensitivity of this test?
选项: 
1. Incidence of chronic prostatitis in the general population
2. Number of men with test results greater than 5 ng/mL and a normal biopsy specimen
3. Prevalence of chronic prostatitis in the general population
4. Prostate biopsies of men with test results equal to or below 5 ng/mL

**1. Question Analysis**
- The question is focused on determining the necessary information required to calculate the sensitivity of a new blood test for detecting prostate cancer. Sensitivity measures the test's ability to correctly identify those with the disease (true positives) out of all actual positive cases (true positives plus false negatives).

**2. Key Medical Considerations**
- **Sensitivity Calculation**: Sensitivity = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives). To calculate sensitivity, it's essential to know not only the number of true positives identified by the test but also the number of actual positive cases that the test failed to identify (false negatives).
- **Study Design Implications**: In the given scenario, only men with serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentrations greater than 5 ng/mL underwent biopsy. Therefore, without testing men with PSA levels ≤5 ng/mL, any prostate cancer cases in this group would remain undetected, representing false negatives.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Incidence of chronic prostatitis in the general population**
   - *Incorrect*: Incidence of chronic prostatitis is unrelated to the calculation of the sensitivity of the prostate cancer test.
2. **Number of men with test results greater than 5 ng/mL and a normal biopsy specimen**
   - *Incorrect*: This information pertains to false positives, which are relevant for calculating specificity, not sensitivity.
3. **Prevalence of chronic prostatitis in the general population**
   - *Incorrect*: Similar to option 1, prevalence of chronic prostatitis does not impact the sensitivity calculation for prostate cancer detection.
4. **Prostate biopsies of men with test results equal to or below 5 ng/mL**
   - *Correct*: To accurately calculate sensitivity, it is necessary to know if there are any prostate cancer cases among men with PSA levels ≤5 ng/mL. This information identifies false negatives, which are crucial for the sensitivity calculation.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question requires determining which data point is essential to calculate the sensitivity of a prostate cancer blood test. Sensitivity refers to the test's ability to correctly identify individuals with the disease (true positives). The scenario involves a study where only those with PSA >5 ng/mL underwent biopsy, the gold standard for diagnosis.  

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Sensitivity Formula**: Sensitivity = (True Positives) / (True Positives + False Negatives) × 100.  
- **True Positives (TP)**: Men with PSA >5 ng/mL and confirmed prostate cancer (given as 90).  
- **False Negatives (FN)**: Men with PSA ≤5 ng/mL but who still have prostate cancer. These individuals were not biopsied, so their cancer status is unknown without additional testing.  
- **Study Design Flaw**: The test’s cutoff (PSA >5 ng/mL) means men with PSA ≤5 were not biopsied, so FN cannot be determined without biopsying this group.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Incidence of chronic prostatitis in the general population.  
  - *Incorrect*. Incidence of prostatitis is unrelated to sensitivity, which focuses on the test’s ability to detect prostate cancer. The 5 cases of prostatitis in the study represent false positives but do not affect sensitivity calculations.  

- **Option 2**: Number of men with test results >5 ng/mL and a normal biopsy specimen.  
  - *Incorrect*. This is the number of false positives (FP). The question already provides data on the biopsy outcomes (90 cancer, 5 prostatitis, and implicitly 5 normal biopsies, totaling 100). FP is not required for sensitivity, which depends on TP and FN.  

- **Option 3**: Prevalence of chronic prostatitis in the general population.  
  - *Incorrect*. Similar to Option 1, prevalence of prostatitis does not impact sensitivity. The focus is on prostate cancer detection, not prostatitis.  

- **Option 4**: Prostate biopsies of men with test results ≤5 ng/mL.  
  - *Correct*. Without biopsying the 200 men with PSA ≤5 ng/mL, the number of false negatives (FN) cannot be determined. These men might have prostate cancer despite their low PSA levels, and their true status is unknown unless biopsied. Sensitivity requires knowing the total number of actual cancer cases (TP + FN), which is impossible without this data.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  

**Explanation**:  
Sensitivity requires knowing all true positives (TP) and false negatives (FN). The TP is already provided (90 men with PSA >5 and cancer). However, the FN—the number of men with PSA ≤5 who still have cancer—is unknown. To calculate FN, biopsies must be performed on the 200 men with PSA ≤5 ng/mL to identify any undetected cancer cases. Without this information, the total number of actual cancer cases in the study cannot be determined, making sensitivity calculation impossible. Options 1–3 are irrelevant to sensitivity in this context.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which information is necessary to calculate the sensitivity of a prostate cancer blood test. Sensitivity requires determining the proportion of true positives (correctly identified cancer cases) among all individuals with the disease (true positives + false negatives).  

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Sensitivity formula**: Sensitivity = True Positives (TP) / (TP + False Negatives (FN)).  
- To compute sensitivity, both TP (test-positive individuals with the disease) and FN (test-negative individuals with the disease) must be known.  
- In this scenario, biopsies were only performed on men with PSA >5 ng/mL (test-positive group), revealing 90 TP (prostate cancer). However, FN (men with PSA ≤5 ng/mL who still have prostate cancer) cannot be identified without evaluating the test-negative group via biopsy.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Incidence of chronic prostatitis is unrelated to sensitivity, as it pertains to specificity (false positives). **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 2**: Men with PSA >5 ng/mL and normal biopsies (false positives) relate to specificity, not sensitivity. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 3**: Prevalence of chronic prostatitis does not affect sensitivity calculations. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 4**: Biopsies of men with PSA ≤5 ng/mL are required to identify FN (undiagnosed cancer cases in test-negative individuals). Without this, FN remains unknown, making sensitivity uncalculable. **Correct**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  
Sensitivity depends on identifying both TP and FN. Since the study only biopsied test-positive individuals (PSA >5 ng/mL), FN can only be determined by biopsying the test-negative group (PSA ≤5 ng/mL). Option 4 provides this critical missing data.
