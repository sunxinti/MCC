**1. Question Analysis**
- The question is focused on identifying the laboratory procedure used to detect cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA in the blood of a bone marrow transplant recipient. The procedure involves reacting purified DNA with specific oligonucleotides, a thermostable DNA polymerase, and nucleotides, followed by thermal cycling and detection through gel electrophoresis.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**
- **Cytomegalovirus (CMV)**: A common virus that can cause significant complications in immunocompromised individuals, such as bone marrow transplant recipients.
- **DNA Detection Methods**: Various laboratory techniques are available for detecting specific DNA sequences, each with distinct mechanisms and applications.
- **Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)**: A molecular biology technique that amplifies specific DNA sequences through repeated cycles of heating and cooling, utilizing thermostable DNA polymerase.
- **Gel Electrophoresis**: A method used to separate DNA fragments based on size, commonly used in conjunction with PCR for detection and analysis.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Northern blotting**
   - **Description**: A technique used to detect specific RNA sequences through hybridization with a labeled probe.
   - **Relevance**: Involves RNA, not DNA; therefore, it is not suitable for detecting CMV DNA.
   - **Conclusion**: Incorrect.

2. **Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)**
   - **Description**: A method that amplifies specific DNA sequences using primers, thermostable DNA polymerase, and thermal cycling.
   - **Relevance**: Matches the described procedure involving oligonucleotides specific for CMV DNA, thermostable DNA polymerase, thermal cycling, and detection by gel electrophoresis.
   - **Conclusion**: Correct.

3. **Reverse transcription**
   - **Description**: The process of converting RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA) using reverse transcriptase.
   - **Relevance**: Primarily used for RNA analysis; not directly applicable to detecting DNA without additional steps.
   - **Conclusion**: Incorrect.

4. **Southern blotting**
   - **Description**: A technique used to detect specific DNA sequences within a DNA sample through hybridization with a labeled probe after gel electrophoresis.
   - **Relevance**: Does not involve the amplification of DNA through thermal cycling; primarily used for detecting larger DNA fragments.
   - **Conclusion**: Incorrect.

**4. Final Selection**

**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which laboratory procedure was used to detect CMV DNA in a bone marrow transplant patient’s blood. The described process involves DNA purification, oligonucleotides specific for CMV DNA, thermostable DNA polymerase, nucleotides, repetitive heating/cooling cycles, and gel electrophoresis. This setup directly relates to nucleic acid amplification and detection techniques.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR):** A method to amplify specific DNA sequences using primers (oligonucleotides), thermostable DNA polymerase (e.g., Taq polymerase), and nucleotides. Cycles of denaturation (heating), annealing (cooling), and extension amplify the target DNA exponentially. The product is visualized via gel electrophoresis.  
- **Southern Blotting:** Detects specific DNA fragments after restriction enzyme digestion, gel separation, and hybridization with a labeled probe. No amplification occurs.  
- **Northern Blotting:** Similar to Southern blotting but for RNA detection. Incompatible here because the question specifies DNA.  
- **Reverse Transcription:** Converts RNA to DNA (part of RT-PCR), irrelevant as the question starts with DNA purification.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Northern blotting):** Incorrect. Northern blotting detects RNA, not DNA, and does not involve PCR cycling.  
- **Option 2 (Polymerase chain reaction):** Correct. All elements match: primers, thermostable polymerase, nucleotides, thermal cycling, and gel electrophoresis.  
- **Option 3 (Reverse transcription):** Incorrect. Reverse transcription converts RNA to DNA, which is not the focus here.  
- **Option 4 (Southern blotting):** Incorrect. Southern blotting lacks the amplification cycles and uses probes, not PCR components.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  
The described process aligns perfectly with PCR, which uses primers, thermostable DNA polymerase, nucleotides, thermal cycling, and gel electrophoresis to amplify and detect CMV DNA. Other methods either lack amplification (Southern blotting) or target RNA (Northern blotting/RT).

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks to identify the laboratory procedure used to detect CMV DNA in a patient’s blood. The described method involves DNA amplification using primers, thermostable DNA polymerase, thermal cycling, and gel electrophoresis for product detection. The core concept revolves around molecular techniques for DNA detection and amplification.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)**: Amplifies specific DNA sequences using primers, thermostable DNA polymerase (e.g., Taq), and repeated heating/cooling cycles (denaturation, annealing, extension). Amplified DNA is then visualized via gel electrophoresis.  
- **Northern Blotting**: Detects RNA, not DNA, using RNA probes. Irrelevant here since the question focuses on DNA.  
- **Reverse Transcription**: Converts RNA to cDNA, typically used in RNA virus detection (e.g., RT-PCR for RNA viruses). CMV is a DNA virus, making this unnecessary.  
- **Southern Blotting**: Detects specific DNA sequences by hybridizing DNA fragments with probes. While it identifies DNA, it does not involve primers, thermostable polymerase, or thermal cycling.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Northern Blotting**  
  Incorrect. Northern blotting targets RNA, not DNA. CMV is a DNA virus, and the question specifies DNA analysis.  

- **Option 2: Polymerase Chain Reaction**  
  Correct. PCR matches the described method: primers (CMV-specific oligonucleotides), thermostable polymerase, thermal cycling, and gel electrophoresis for product detection. This technique amplifies CMV DNA for sensitive identification.  

- **Option 3: Reverse Transcription**  
  Incorrect. Reverse transcription converts RNA to cDNA. Since CMV is a DNA virus, RNA intermediates are not relevant here, and no RNA-to-cDNA step is described.  

- **Option 4: Southern Blotting**  
  Incorrect. Southern blotting detects DNA but lacks amplification via primers and thermal cycling. The question explicitly mentions repeated heating/cooling cycles, a hallmark of PCR.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The described procedure—using primers, thermostable polymerase, thermal cycling, and gel electrophoresis—is definitive of PCR. No other listed method combines these features.  

**My final selection is: Option 2**
