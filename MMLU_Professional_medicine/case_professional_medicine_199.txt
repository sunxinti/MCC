问题: 
A 70-year-old woman comes to the office because of worsening tremor of her hands. The tremor has been present for most of her life and initially was mild and would occur only when she was tired or stressed. During the past month the shaking has become more noticeable and frequent. She is now embarrassed to eat with other people because of how obvious the tremor has become. The patient has been taking fluoxetine for the past 3 weeks to help her to cope with the death of her husband 2 months ago. Medical history is also remarkable for essential hypertension controlled with lisinopril and hyperlipidemia controlled with atorvastatin. Her only other medication is occasional ibuprofen for joint pain. She used to drink one to two alcoholic beverages monthly but now drinks one glass of wine daily because, she says, it reduces her tremor. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (155 lb); BMI is 25 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 36.4°C (97.6°F), pulse 80/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 130/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a moderate tremor of both hands that is not present at rest. Complete blood count, serum chemistry profile, and serum thyroid function tests are ordered and results are pending. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's worsening tremor?
选项: 
1. Adverse effect of fluoxetine therapy
2. Bereavement reaction
3. Early Parkinson disease
4. Increase in alcohol consumption

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**
- **Objective:** Determine the most likely cause of a 70-year-old woman's worsening hand tremor.
- **Key Details:**
  - Long-standing tremor, initially mild, action/postural.
  - Tremor has worsened over the past month.
  - Initiated fluoxetine therapy 3 weeks ago.
  - Increased alcohol consumption to one glass of wine daily to reduce tremor.
  - No tremor at rest.
  - Other medications: lisinopril, atorvastatin, occasional ibuprofen.
  
**2. Key Medical Considerations**
- **Essential Tremor:**
  - Common, often familial.
  - Predominantly action/postural tremor.
  - Can be alleviated temporarily by alcohol.
  - May worsen with stress, fatigue, or certain medications.
- **Parkinson Disease:**
  - Characterized by resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity.
  - Unlikely in this case due to the absence of resting tremor and other Parkinsonian features.
- **Drug-Induced Tremor:**
  - Certain medications, including SSRIs like fluoxetine, can cause or exacerbate tremors.
- **Bereavement Reaction:**
  - Can increase stress and anxiety, potentially worsening tremors.
- **Alcohol Consumption:**
  - Typically reduces essential tremor; increased consumption usually alleviates rather than worsens tremor.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Adverse effect of fluoxetine therapy**
   - **Pros:** Fluoxetine (an SSRI) is known to cause tremors as a side effect. The timing (worsening tremor after starting fluoxetine) aligns with this possibility.
   - **Cons:** None significant; supports the worsening tremor.
   
2. **Bereavement reaction**
   - **Pros:** Stress from bereavement can exacerbate tremors.
   - **Cons:** Bereavement occurred 2 months ago, but tremor worsening began over the past month, which coincides more closely with starting fluoxetine.
   
3. **Early Parkinson disease**
   - **Pros:** Tremor is present.
   - **Cons:** Tremor is not at rest, and there are no other Parkinsonian symptoms. Long-standing nature of tremor suggests essential tremor over Parkinson's.
   
4. **Increase in alcohol consumption**
   - **Pros:** None applicable.
   - **Cons:** Alcohol typically reduces essential tremor. Increased consumption is unlikely to worsen tremor and may actually alleviate it temporarily.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks for the most likely cause of a worsening action tremor in a 70-year-old woman with a lifelong history of tremor. Key considerations include medication side effects, alcohol use, psychological stress, and neurodegenerative conditions like Parkinson disease. The tremor’s characteristics (action tremor, not present at rest) and recent medication changes are critical to evaluating the options.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Essential Tremor**: A common neurologic disorder characterized by action tremors (postural/kinetic), often familial, and exacerbated by stress or fatigue. Alcohol can temporarily reduce symptoms.  
- **SSRI-Induced Tremor**: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine) are known to cause or worsen tremors. Onset typically occurs within weeks of starting therapy.  
- **Parkinson Disease**: Presents with a resting tremor (most prominent at rest) and other features like bradykinesia. The absence of resting tremor here makes it unlikely.  
- **Alcohol’s Role**: Chronic alcohol use can cause tremors (e.g., alcohol withdrawal), but the patient reports that alcohol *reduces* her tremor. Increased consumption might not directly worsen it unless tolerance develops, which is less likely.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Adverse effect of fluoxetine therapy)**: Fluoxetine is an SSRI, and tremor is a well-documented side effect. The patient started fluoxetine 3 weeks ago, coinciding with the reported worsening of tremor. This is a plausible explanation.  
- **Option 2 (Bereavement reaction)**: While stress from bereavement may exacerbate an existing tremor, it does not directly explain the sudden worsening. The question emphasizes the tremor’s progression, which is better explained by a pharmacologic cause.  
- **Option 3 (Early Parkinson disease)**: Parkinson disease typically presents with a resting tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity. The absence of a resting tremor here makes this unlikely, especially in a patient with a lifelong action tremor.  
- **Option 4 (Increase in alcohol consumption)**: The patient reports that alcohol *reduces* her tremor. Increased intake might theoretically mitigate symptoms rather than worsen them. Alcohol-induced tremors usually occur in withdrawal, not with chronic use.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The patient’s tremor is consistent with essential tremor, but the recent worsening aligns with the initiation of fluoxetine. SSRIs like fluoxetine commonly cause tremors, and the timing of symptom progression matches the medication’s start. Other options are less consistent with the clinical presentation.  

**My final selection is: Option 1**

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks for the most likely cause of a worsening hand tremor in a 70-year-old woman with a history of lifelong mild tremor. Key elements include the temporal association with fluoxetine initiation, increased alcohol consumption, and the absence of resting tremor. The goal is to identify the etiology of the exacerbation using clinical features and medication history.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Essential tremor (ET):** Typically presents as a bilateral action tremor, worsened by stress, fatigue, or stimulants (e.g., caffeine, certain medications). Alcohol may transiently improve ET.  
- **Drug-induced tremor:** SSRIs (e.g., fluoxetine) are associated with enhanced physiological tremors, often manifesting as action tremors. Onset correlates with medication initiation.  
- **Alcohol-related tremor:** Chronic use or withdrawal can cause tremors, but one daily glass is unlikely to induce withdrawal. Rebound tremor after alcohol metabolism is possible but less likely at low intake.  
- **Parkinson disease (PD):** Characterized by resting tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. The absence of resting tremor and other PD features makes this unlikely.  
- **Stress (bereavement):** Stress exacerbates ET but is less likely to be the primary cause of sudden worsening without other triggers.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Adverse effect of fluoxetine):**  
  Fluoxetine, an SSRI, is strongly associated with drug-induced tremors. The worsening tremor aligns temporally with its initiation (3 weeks prior). SSRIs enhance physiological tremor via serotoninergic pathways. **Correct**.  
- **Option 2 (Bereavement reaction):**  
  Stress from bereavement can exacerbate ET, but the tremor worsened *after* starting fluoxetine, not immediately after her husband’s death. Stress alone is insufficient to explain the abrupt change. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 3 (Early Parkinson disease):**  
  PD tremor is resting, unilateral initially, and accompanied by rigidity/bradykinesia. The patient’s action tremor and lack of PD signs rule this out. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 4 (Increase in alcohol consumption):**  
  While alcohol withdrawal can cause tremor, her intake (1 glass/day) is unlikely to induce withdrawal. She reports alcohol *reduces* her tremor, suggesting ET rather than alcohol-related worsening. **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The most plausible explanation is **fluoxetine-induced tremor**, given the temporal relationship, known SSRI side effects, and absence of features supporting other options.  

**My final selection is: Option 1**
