================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question focuses on identifying the source tissue of B-hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) detected in pregnancy tests and understanding its role in maintaining pregnancy. It assesses knowledge of early pregnancy physiology and hormonal interactions.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
B-hCG is a hormone produced early in pregnancy. Its primary function is to maintain the corpus luteum, which in turn secretes progesterone essential for sustaining the uterine lining (endometrium) and preventing menstruation. The corpus luteum maintenance is crucial until the placenta takes over progesterone production around the 10th week of gestation. B-hCG is produced by the cells of the developing embryo, specifically the trophoblasts of the blastocyst.

**3. Analysis of Options**

1. **Corpus luteum, self-maintenance**  
   - *Incorrect.* While B-hCG acts to maintain the corpus luteum, it is not secreted by the corpus luteum itself.

2. **Endometrium, cell division**  
   - *Incorrect.* The endometrium is the lining of the uterus and does not secrete B-hCG. Additionally, B-hCG's primary role is not directly promoting cell division in the endometrium.

3. **Blastocyst, increase in blood flow**  
   - *Partially Correct.* The blastocyst does secrete B-hCG, but the main function of B-hCG is to maintain the corpus luteum, not primarily to increase blood flow.

4. **Blastocyst, corpus luteum maintenance**  
   - *Correct.* The blastocyst secretes B-hCG, which ensures the maintenance of the corpus luteum. This maintenance is vital for continuous progesterone production, supporting the uterine lining and sustaining the pregnancy.

**4. Final Selection**  
My final selection is: Option 4

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks about the tissue that secretes B-hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) and its primary function.  
- It requires knowledge of early pregnancy physiology, the role of hCG, and the embryonic structures involved in hormone production.  

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **B-hCG Production**: hCG is produced by the **syncytiotrophoblast cells** of the **blastocyst** (specifically during early pregnancy before the placenta is fully formed). These cells develop from the trophoblast layer of the blastocyst.  
- **Function of hCG**: The primary role of hCG is to **maintain the corpus luteum** in the ovary. The corpus luteum secretes progesterone, which is essential for sustaining the endometrium and preventing menstruation. Without hCG, the corpus luteum would degenerate, leading to progesterone withdrawal and miscarriage.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Corpus luteum, self-maintenance  
  - **Incorrect**. The corpus luteum secretes progesterone, not hCG. hCG’s role is to *maintain* the corpus luteum, not to be produced by it.  
- **Option 2**: Endometrium, cell division  
  - **Incorrect**. The endometrium is the uterine lining and does not secrete hCG. Cell division is not the primary function of hCG.  
- **Option 3**: Blastocyst, increase in blood flow  
  - **Incorrect**. While increased blood flow to the uterus occurs during pregnancy, hCG’s direct role is corpus luteum maintenance, not vascular changes.  
- **Option 4**: Blastocyst, corpus luteum maintenance  
  - **Correct**. The blastocyst (via syncytiotrophoblast cells) produces hCG, and its key function is to preserve the corpus luteum, ensuring continued progesterone production.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  

The blastocyst is the correct tissue source of hCG, and its primary function is to maintain the corpus luteum. This ensures progesterone levels remain high, supporting the endometrium and preventing menstruation. Other options misattribute the source of hCG or incorrectly describe its function.

选择: 选项 4 (Blastocyst, corpus luteum maintenance)

DeepSeek的完整回答:
================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks two key points:  
  1. The tissue responsible for secreting B-hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin).  
  2. The primary function of this hormone.  

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **B-hCG Source**: During early pregnancy, B-hCG is secreted by the **syncytiotrophoblast**, a component of the blastocyst (specifically, the developing placenta after implantation).  
- **Function**: B-hCG maintains the **corpus luteum** (a temporary endocrine structure in the ovaries formed after ovulation). The corpus luteum secretes progesterone, which sustains the endometrial lining and prevents menstruation, ensuring the pregnancy continues.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Corpus luteum, self-maintenance)**  
  - Incorrect. The corpus luteum does not secrete B-hCG; instead, it is maintained *by* B-hCG. "Self-maintenance" is a misattribution.  
- **Option 2 (Endometrium, cell division)**  
  - Incorrect. The endometrium does not produce B-hCG. While progesterone (from the corpus luteum) supports endometrial growth, cell division is not a primary function of B-hCG.  
- **Option 3 (Blastocyst, increase in blood flow)**  
  - Partially correct source (blastocyst) but incorrect function. B-hCG does not directly increase blood flow; this is mediated by other hormones like progesterone and estrogen.  
- **Option 4 (Blastocyst, corpus luteum maintenance)**  
  - Correct. The blastocyst (via syncytiotrophoblast cells) secretes B-hCG, which prevents the corpus luteum from degenerating, ensuring continued progesterone production.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  
- **Explanation**: B-hCG is secreted by the blastocyst’s trophoblastic cells (syncytiotrophoblast) to sustain the corpus luteum, which in turn secretes progesterone. This aligns with the hormonal physiology of early pregnancy.
