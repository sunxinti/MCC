**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is inquiring about which substance or hormone facilitates the uptake of both glucose and amino acids into muscle cells. This involves understanding the regulatory mechanisms controlling nutrient uptake in muscle tissues.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Glucose Uptake in Muscles:** Insulin is the primary hormone responsible for promoting glucose uptake in muscle cells by facilitating the translocation of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) to the cell membrane.
- **Amino Acid Uptake in Muscles:** Insulin also enhances the uptake of amino acids into muscle cells, which is essential for protein synthesis and muscle growth.
- **Adrenaline (Epinephrine):** Mainly involved in the fight-or-flight response, increasing blood glucose levels through glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis but does not promote glucose or amino acid uptake into muscles.
- **Glycogen:** A storage form of glucose in liver and muscle tissues, not a hormone, and does not directly influence the uptake of glucose or amino acids.
- **Cortisol:** A glucocorticoid hormone that increases blood glucose levels and has catabolic effects on proteins, leading to protein breakdown rather than uptake.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Adrenaline:** Incorrect. While adrenaline increases blood glucose levels, it does not promote the uptake of glucose or amino acids into muscle cells.
2. **Insulin:** Correct. Insulin facilitates the uptake of glucose and amino acids into muscle cells, promoting their utilization and storage.
3. **Glycogen:** Incorrect. Glycogen serves as a glucose storage molecule and does not directly promote nutrient uptake.
4. **Cortisol:** Incorrect. Cortisol promotes gluconeogenesis and protein catabolism, opposing the uptake of amino acids into muscles.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which substance promotes the uptake of glucose and amino acids into muscle cells. This requires understanding the roles of hormones and metabolic molecules in nutrient transport and cellular signaling pathways related to muscle metabolism.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Glucose Uptake:** Insulin is the primary hormone that stimulates glucose uptake into muscle and adipose tissue by translocating glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) to the cell membrane.  
- **Amino Acid Uptake:** Insulin also enhances amino acid uptake by promoting the translocation of amino acid transporters and stimulating protein synthesis.  
- **Hormonal Effects:** Adrenaline and cortisol are catabolic hormones. Adrenaline mobilizes energy substrates (e.g., glycogen breakdown), while cortisol increases blood glucose via gluconeogenesis and inhibits insulin signaling.  
- **Glycogen:** A storage form of glucose, not a signaling molecule to promote nutrient uptake.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Adrenaline):** Adrenaline stimulates glycogen breakdown in the liver and muscles, releasing glucose into the blood. It does not directly promote glucose uptake into muscles; instead, it may prioritize fatty acid oxidation over glucose uptake during stress. **Incorrect.**  
- **Option 2 (Insulin):** Insulin directly stimulates glucose uptake into muscle cells via GLUT4 translocation and enhances amino acid transport to support protein synthesis. **Correct.**  
- **Option 3 (Glycogen):** Glycogen is stored glucose and does not act as a signaling molecule to promote nutrient uptake. **Incorrect.**  
- **Option 4 (Cortisol):** Cortisol opposes insulin action, reduces glucose uptake, and promotes protein breakdown rather than uptake. **Incorrect.**  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  
Insulin is the only option that directly and effectively promotes both glucose and amino acid uptake into muscle cells through its anabolic effects on cellular transporters and metabolic pathways. Adrenaline, cortisol, and glycogen do not fulfill this role.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which option promotes the uptake of glucose and amino acids into muscle tissue. This involves understanding hormonal regulation of nutrient metabolism and muscle physiology.  

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Insulin** is a peptide hormone secreted by pancreatic β-cells in response to elevated blood glucose. It facilitates glucose uptake into muscle and adipose tissue via GLUT4 transporter translocation.  
- Insulin also enhances amino acid uptake by muscle cells, promoting protein synthesis and inhibiting proteolysis.  
- **Adrenaline (epinephrine)** increases blood glucose via glycogenolysis (liver) and lipolysis (adipose), preparing the body for "fight or flight." It does not promote glucose/amino acid uptake into muscles.  
- **Glycogen** is a glucose polymer stored in liver and muscle; it is not a hormone and does not regulate uptake.  
- **Cortisol** (a glucocorticoid) increases gluconeogenesis and promotes proteolysis (releasing amino acids), opposing insulin’s anabolic effects.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Adrenaline**  
  Incorrect. Adrenaline mobilizes glucose and fatty acids for energy but does not stimulate muscle uptake of glucose or amino acids.  

- **Option 2: Insulin**  
  Correct. Insulin directly activates insulin receptors on muscle cells, triggering GLUT4-mediated glucose uptake and enhancing amino acid transporter activity.  

- **Option 3: Glycogen**  
  Incorrect. Glycogen is a stored form of glucose and does not regulate cellular uptake.  

- **Option 4: Cortisol**  
  Incorrect. Cortisol promotes catabolism (e.g., muscle breakdown) and insulin resistance, reducing glucose/amino acid uptake in muscles.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  
Insulin is the only hormone listed that directly stimulates both glucose and amino acid uptake into muscle cells, aligning with its role in postprandial nutrient storage and anabolism.
