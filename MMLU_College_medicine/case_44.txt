**1. Question Analysis**
- **Topic:** DNA replication and base pairing.
- **Objective:** Determine the ratio of adenine (A) to thymine (T) in the newly synthesized complementary DNA strand given a specific A:T ratio in the template strand.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**
- **Base Pairing Rules:** In DNA, adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T), and cytosine (C) pairs with guanine (G).
- **DNA Polymerase Function:** During DNA replication, DNA polymerase adds complementary nucleotides to the template strand to form a new strand.
- **Complementary Ratios:** The ratio of bases in the template strand directly dictates the complementary ratio in the newly synthesized strand based on base pairing rules.

**3. Analysis of Options**
- **Option 1: 3:02**
  - **Interpretation:** Likely a typographical error intended to represent a 3:2 ratio.
  - **Evaluation:** If interpreted as 3:2, this would mirror the template strand's ratio, which is incorrect because the complementary strand should have a T:A ratio of 3:2, translating to an A:T ratio of 2:3.
  
- **Option 2: 1:01**
  - **Interpretation:** Likely represents a 1:1 ratio.
  - **Evaluation:** This suggests equal amounts of A and T, which does not reflect the 3:2 ratio in the template strand. Therefore, it is incorrect.
  
- **Option 3: 2:03**
  - **Interpretation:** Likely represents a 2:3 ratio.
  - **Evaluation:** This correctly reflects the complementary relationship. Given a template strand A:T ratio of 3:2, the new strand would have a T:A ratio of 3:2, which translates to an A:T ratio of 2:3.
  
- **Option 4: cannot be determined**
  - **Evaluation:** This is incorrect because the ratio can be determined using base pairing rules.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question examines understanding of DNA replication and complementary base pairing. It asks about the ratio of adenine (A) to thymine (T) in the newly synthesized DNA strand when the template strand has a specific A:T ratio.  

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **DNA Replication Basics**: DNA polymerase synthesizes the complementary strand by pairing nucleotides according to base-pairing rules (A pairs with T, T pairs with A, G pairs with C, and C pairs with G).  
- **Base Pairing Rules**: For any DNA strand, the complementary strand will have a base composition that is the inverse of the template strand. For example, if the template has more A’s, the complementary strand will have more T’s.  
- **Ratio Calculation**: The ratio of A:T in the complementary strand is determined by flipping the ratio of T:A in the template strand.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (3:02)**: Incorrect. This matches the template strand’s A:T ratio, but the complementary strand must have an inverted ratio.  
- **Option 2 (1:01)**: Incorrect. A 1:1 ratio would only occur if the template strand’s A:T ratio was 1:1, which it is not.  
- **Option 3 (2:03)**: Correct. If the template has an A:T ratio of 3:2, the complementary strand will have T:A pairs equal to the template’s A:T ratio. Thus, the complementary strand’s A (paired with template T) and T (paired with template A) will have an A:T ratio of 2:3.  
- **Option 4 (cannot be determined)**: Incorrect. The ratio can be determined using base-pairing rules.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks about the ratio of adenine (A) to thymine (T) in a newly synthesized DNA strand, given a 3:2 ratio of A:T in the template strand during DNA replication. It tests understanding of complementary base pairing and DNA synthesis principles.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- DNA replication follows complementary base pairing: adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T), and cytosine (C) pairs with guanine (G).  
- The new strand is synthesized antiparallel and complementary to the template strand.  
- If the template strand has a 3:2 ratio of A:T, the complementary strand will have a T:A ratio of 3:2. This translates to an A:T ratio of 2:3 in the new strand.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (3:2):** Incorrect. This ratio reflects the template strand’s A:T composition, not the complementary new strand.  
- **Option 2 (1:1):** Incorrect. A 1:1 ratio would only occur if the template strand had equal A and T, which is not the case here.  
- **Option 3 (2:3):** Correct. The new strand’s A:T ratio is determined by the template’s T and A counts. Template A (3) becomes T in the new strand, and template T (2) becomes A in the new strand, yielding A:T = 2:3.  
- **Option 4 (cannot be determined):** Incorrect. The ratio can be directly calculated using complementary pairing rules.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The newly synthesized strand’s A:T ratio is determined by the template strand’s T and A counts, resulting in 2:3.  

**My final selection is: Option 3**
