**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question assesses the understanding of societal norms and their classifications, specifically identifying the types of norm violations committed by a teenager based on his actions. It requires categorizing each action according to sociological concepts such as mores, taboos, folkways, and the law.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- While the question primarily pertains to sociology, a medical perspective might consider behavioral analysis related to antisocial behavior or potential psychological issues. Understanding the severity and nature of norm violations can be relevant in diagnosing behavioral disorders. However, the question does not directly involve medical concepts but rather focuses on social norm classifications.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: mores, mores, the law, mores**  
  - **Consensual incest (with sister):** Taboo  
  - **Leaving no tip at the bar:** Folkway  
  - **Non-consensual sexual relations:** The law  
  - **Vomiting on church steps:** Folkway or Mores  
  - *Incorrect:* The first action is a taboo, not a more.

- **Option 2: taboo, folkways, the law, and taboo**  
  - **Consensual incest:** Taboo  
  - **Leaving no tip at the bar:** Folkway  
  - **Non-consensual sexual relations:** The law  
  - **Vomiting on church steps:** Mores  
  - *Incorrect:* The last action is better categorized as mores rather than taboo.

- **Option 3: the law, folkways, folkways, and folkways**  
  - **Consensual incest:** Taboo  
  - *Incorrect:* Does not correctly categorize the severity of the violations.

- **Option 4: taboo, folkways, the law, and mores**  
  - **Consensual incest:** Taboo  
  - **Leaving no tip at the bar:** Folkway  
  - **Non-consensual sexual relations:** The law  
  - **Vomiting on church steps:** Mores  
  - *Correct:* Accurately categorizes each action based on the severity of norm violation.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question examines understanding societal norms categorized as **taboos, folkways, mores, and laws**. It requires distinguishing the severity and type of norm violation for each action listed. While not strictly medical, this question tests knowledge of sociological concepts relevant to ethical and legal frameworks in medicine, such as consent, legality, and societal expectations.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Taboo**: A strong, intense prohibition (e.g., incest, cannibalism).  
- **Mores**: Norms with moral significance critical to societal functioning (e.g., religious norms, marriage rules).  
- **Folkways**: Minor norms of etiquette or convention (e.g., tipping, greeting customs).  
- **Law**: Formal rules enforced by the state (e.g., criminal statutes).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Incorrect. Consensual incest with a sister is a **taboo**, not merely *mores*. Leaving no tip is a *folkway*, not *mores*. Vomiting at a church may violate *folkways* or *mores* but not the "greatest degree" of *mores* compared to incest or non-consensual sex.  
- **Option 2**: Incorrect. The fourth action (vomiting at church) is not a *taboo* but likely a *folkway* or *mores*. Non-consensual sex is a *law* violation, not *taboo*.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. Consensual incest is a *taboo* and *law* violation, not merely *law*. Folkways apply to minor norms like no tip, but the first action is more severe.  
- **Option 4**: Correct.  
  - **i. Consensual incest**: A **taboo** (intense societal prohibition) and illegal in most jurisdictions.  
  - **ii. No tip**: A **folkway** (minor etiquette norm).  
  - **iii. Non-consensual sex**: A **law** violation (rape is criminal).  
  - **iv. Vomiting at church**: Likely violates **mores** (serious societal norms against disrespecting sacred spaces).  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  
This option correctly categorizes each action by severity and societal/legal norms: incest as a taboo, no tip as a folkway, non-consensual sex as a legal violation, and vomiting at a church as a mores violation.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question assesses understanding of societal norm violations categorized as folkways, mores, taboos, or legal breaches. It requires distinguishing between these sociological concepts to determine the severity/type of each act.  

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Folkways**: Minor social conventions (e.g., tipping). Violations cause mild disapproval.  
- **Mores**: Morally significant norms (e.g., religious respect). Violations provoke strong moral condemnation.  
- **Taboos**: Deeply ingrained prohibitions (e.g., incest). Violations evoke universal revulsion.  
- **Law**: Legally codified rules (e.g., rape). Violations result in legal penalties.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Incorrect. Incest (1st act) is a *taboo*, not merely a "more." Non-consensual sex (3rd act) violates *the law*, not "mores."  
- **Option 2**: Incorrect. Vomiting on church steps (4th act) violates *mores* (religious sanctity), not "taboo."  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. Incest (1st act) is a *taboo*, not a legal violation.  
- **Option 4**: Correct.  
  1. Incest = **taboo** (universally condemned).  
  2. No tip = **folkways** (minor social norm).  
  3. Rape = **the law** (criminal act).  
  4. Church desecration = **mores** (moral/religious offense).  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  
This aligns with the definitions: incest (taboo), no tip (folkways), rape (law), and church desecration (mores). Each violation reflects the appropriate societal norm hierarchy.
