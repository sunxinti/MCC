问题: 
A psychologist conducts an experiment in which subjects are asked to learn a series of “facts” which are actually statements that have been fabricated by the research team. The subjects consist of undergraduate students at the university where the experiment is being conducted. The subjects are randomly assigned to groups that are compensated either $10 or $20 for their participation, are given either 15 minutes or 30 minutes to learn the facts, and are asked to recall the facts either in the same room in which they learned the facts or in a very different, unfamiliar setting. Which of the following are dependent variables in this experiment?
I. The amount the subjects were compensated.
II. The room in which the subjects were asked to recall facts.
III. The number of facts the subjects can recall.
IV. The time the subjects were given to learn the facts.
选项: 
1. II only
2. III only
3. I and IV only
4. I and III and IV only

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question assesses understanding of experimental design, specifically identifying dependent variables within a psychological study. It requires distinguishing between variables that are manipulated (independent variables) and those that are measured as outcomes (dependent variables).

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- In experimental research, **dependent variables** are the outcomes that researchers measure to assess the effect of different conditions. **Independent variables** are the factors that are manipulated to observe their impact on dependent variables.
- Understanding the distinction between these types of variables is crucial in designing experiments and interpreting results in medical and psychological research.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **I. The amount the subjects were compensated.**  
  - **Independent Variable:** This is a manipulated factor to see if compensation affects recall.
- **II. The room in which the subjects were asked to recall facts.**  
  - **Independent Variable:** This is another manipulated factor to assess the effect of environment on recall.
- **III. The number of facts the subjects can recall.**  
  - **Dependent Variable:** This is the outcome measured to evaluate the effect of the independent variables.
- **IV. The time the subjects were given to learn the facts.**  
  - **Independent Variable:** This is manipulated to determine its effect on recall performance.
  
- **Option 1. II only**  
  - Incorrect. II is an independent variable, not a dependent variable.
- **Option 2. III only**  
  - Correct. III is the sole dependent variable.
- **Option 3. I and IV only**  
  - Incorrect. Both I and IV are independent variables.
- **Option 4. I and III and IV only**  
  - Incorrect. I and IV are independent variables; only III is dependent.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks to identify the dependent variables in an experiment where subjects learn fabricated facts under varying conditions (compensation, learning time, recall setting). Dependent variables are outcomes measured by the researcher, while independent variables are factors manipulated by the researcher to assess their effect on the dependent variable.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
This question tests understanding of experimental design, specifically the distinction between independent and dependent variables. In medical research, dependent variables represent the outcome being studied, whereas independent variables are the conditions or factors the researcher manipulates to observe their impact on the outcome.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **I. The amount the subjects were compensated.**  
  This is an **independent variable** because it is a condition manipulated by the researcher (compensation levels). It does not depend on other variables. **Incorrect**.  

- **II. The room in which the subjects were asked to recall facts.**  
  This is also an **independent variable** because the researcher is intentionally varying the recall setting (same vs. different room). It is not an outcome being measured. **Incorrect**.  

- **III. The number of facts the subjects can recall.**  
  This is the **dependent variable** because it is the outcome the researcher is measuring to assess the effects of the independent variables (compensation, time, setting). **Correct**.  

- **IV. The time the subjects were given to learn the facts.**  
  This is an **independent variable** as it is a manipulated condition (15 vs. 30 minutes). It does not depend on other variables. **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  

The only dependent variable in this experiment is the number of facts recalled (III). The other options (I, II, IV) are independent variables manipulated by the researcher to observe their effects on the dependent variable.

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question tests understanding of experimental design variables (independent vs. dependent) in a psychology/medical research context. Dependent variables are outcomes measured, while independent variables are manipulated by researchers.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Independent variables**: Factors controlled/manipulated by researchers (e.g., compensation amount, learning time, recall environment).  
- **Dependent variables**: Outcomes measured to assess the effect of manipulations (e.g., number of facts recalled).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **I. Compensation amount**: Independent (researchers set $10/$20). **Incorrect**.  
- **II. Recall room**: Independent (manipulated by researchers). **Incorrect**.  
- **III. Number of facts recalled**: Dependent (measured outcome). **Correct**.  
- **IV. Learning time**: Independent (researchers set 15/30 minutes). **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
- Only **III** is a dependent variable. All others are independent variables manipulated by the experiment.  

**My final selection is: Option 2**
