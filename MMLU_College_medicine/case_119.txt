**1. Question Analysis**
- The question is inquiring about the structural composition of codons. Specifically, it seeks to identify what sequences constitute codons within the context of molecular biology, which is fundamental to understanding genetic translation and protein synthesis.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**
- **Codon Definition**: Codons are sequences of three nucleotide bases in messenger RNA (mRNA) that correspond to specific amino acids or stop signals during protein synthesis.
- **Genetic Code**: The genetic code is read in triplet codons, where each triplet corresponds to an amino acid or a regulatory signal.
- **Transcription and Translation**: During transcription, DNA is converted into mRNA, which is then read by ribosomes during translation to synthesize proteins based on the sequence of codons.
- **Nucleotide Bases**: The primary components of codons are adenine (A), thymine (T) in DNA or uracil (U) in RNA, cytosine (C), and guanine (G).

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Triplet sequences of nucleotide bases in mRNA or DNA.**
   - **Correctness**: Partially correct. Codons are indeed triplet sequences of nucleotide bases in mRNA. While DNA contains triplet codons in the coding strand, the functional codons are primarily in mRNA during translation.
   - **Conclusion**: Mostly correct.

2. **Quadruplet sequences of nucleotide bases in mRNA or DNA.**
   - **Correctness**: Incorrect. Codons consist of three, not four, nucleotide bases.
   - **Conclusion**: Incorrect.

3. **Triplet sequences of amino acids in polypeptide chains.**
   - **Correctness**: Incorrect. Codons are sequences of nucleotide bases, not amino acids.
   - **Conclusion**: Incorrect.

4. **Triplet sequences of deoxyribose sugars in DNA.**
   - **Correctness**: Incorrect. Codons refer to sequences of nucleotide bases, not the sugar component of DNA.
   - **Conclusion**: Incorrect.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks about the composition of codons, which are fundamental units in genetic coding. It requires understanding the structure and function of codons in molecular biology, specifically their relationship to nucleotide bases in nucleic acids (DNA or mRNA) and their role in protein synthesis.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Codons**: A codon is a sequence of three nucleotide bases (triplet) in mRNA that specifies a particular amino acid or a start/stop signal during protein synthesis.  
- **Genetic Code**: The genetic code is read in triplets (triplet code), meaning each amino acid is encoded by a unique combination of three nucleotides.  
- **Nucleic Acids**: DNA contains deoxyribonucleotides (with deoxyribose sugar), while mRNA contains ribonucleotides (with ribose sugar). Codons are directly present in mRNA during translation but are also encoded in DNA as the template for mRNA transcription.  
- **Amino Acids**: Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, specified by codons but not part of codons themselves.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: "Triplet sequences of nucleotide bases in mRNA or DNA."  
  - **Correct**: Codons are indeed triplets of nucleotide bases. While mRNA is the direct template for translation, DNA contains the same triplet sequences that are transcribed into mRNA. This option aligns with the definition of codons.  

- **Option 2**: "Quadruplet sequences of nucleotide bases in mRNA or DNA."  
  - **Incorrect**: The genetic code is based on triplets, not quadruplets. There is no biological basis for quadruplet codons in standard genetic coding.  

- **Option 3**: "Triplet sequences of amino acids in polypeptide chains."  
  - **Incorrect**: Amino acids form polypeptide chains, but codons specify which amino acids are added. The codon itself consists of nucleotide bases, not amino acids.  

- **Option 4**: "Triplet sequences of deoxyribose sugars in DNA."  
  - **Incorrect**: Deoxyribose is the sugar component of DNA’s backbone, but codons are defined by the sequence of nucleotide bases (adenine, thymine, cytosine, guanine), not the sugar molecules.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**  
Codons are defined as triplet sequences of nucleotide bases. They are found in mRNA during translation and are encoded in DNA as the template for mRNA transcription. The other options incorrectly describe codons as involving quadruplets, amino acids, or deoxyribose sugars, which are not accurate based on molecular biology principles.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks about the composition of codons, focusing on their structural components in terms of molecular biology. Codons are fundamental units of the genetic code, and the answer requires understanding their nucleotide composition and location (mRNA vs. DNA).

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Codons** are sequences of three nucleotides (triplets) in **mRNA** that specify amino acids or stop signals during protein synthesis.  
- DNA contains complementary sequences to mRNA codons (via transcription), but the term "codon" strictly refers to mRNA.  
- Nucleotide bases (adenine, uracil, cytosine, guanine in mRNA; thymine replaces uracil in DNA) form codons, not amino acids or sugars.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: "Triplet sequences of nucleotide bases in mRNA or DNA."  
  - Correct in stating codons are triplets of nucleotides. However, codons are specific to mRNA. While DNA contains complementary triplet sequences, these are not termed "codons." This inclusion of DNA makes the option slightly ambiguous but partially accurate.  
- **Option 2**: "Quadruplet sequences..."  
  - Incorrect. Codons are universally triplets, not quadruplets.  
- **Option 3**: "Triplet sequences of amino acids..."  
  - Incorrect. Codons are composed of nucleotides, not amino acids. Amino acids are the products of codon translation.  
- **Option 4**: "Triplet sequences of deoxyribose sugars..."  
  - Incorrect. Codons are defined by nucleotide bases (not sugars) and are absent in DNA's sugar-phosphate backbone.  

**4. Final Selection**  
Option 1 is the most accurate answer despite the inclusion of DNA, as it correctly identifies the triplet structure of nucleotide bases. While codons are mRNA-specific, the question’s phrasing allows for this broader interpretation. Other options are factually incorrect.  

**My final selection is: Option 1**
