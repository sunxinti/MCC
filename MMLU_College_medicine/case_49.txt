**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is a stoichiometry problem involving the combustion of ethane (C₂H₆) with unlimited oxygen (O₂) to produce carbon dioxide (CO₂) and water (H₂O). It requires calculating the mass of CO₂ produced from a given mass of ethane.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- While the question is primarily a chemistry problem, understanding the production of CO₂ is relevant in medical contexts such as cellular respiration and metabolic processes where CO₂ is a byproduct. However, the core of this problem revolves around chemical stoichiometry rather than direct medical knowledge.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Balanced Equation:** The combustion of ethane is represented as:
  
  \( \text{C}_2\text{H}_6 + \frac{7}{2} \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2 \text{CO}_2 + 3 \text{H}_2\text{O} \)
  
- **Molecular Weights:**
  - C₂H₆: (2×12) + (6×1) = 30 g/mol
  - CO₂: 12 + (2×16) = 44 g/mol

- **Calculations:**
  - Moles of C₂H₆: \( \frac{84 \text{g}}{30 \text{g/mol}} = 2.8 \text{ mol} \)
  - Moles of CO₂ produced: \( 2 \text{ mol CO}_2 \) per \( 1 \text{ mol C}_2\text{H}_6 \) → \( 2.8 \times 2 = 5.6 \text{ mol CO}_2 \)
  - Mass of CO₂: \( 5.6 \text{ mol} \times 44 \text{g/mol} = 246.4 \text{ g} \)
  
  However, considering the given options and potential rounding:
  
  - **Option 1: 78g** – Incorrect
  - **Option 2: 528g** – Incorrect
  - **Option 3: 264g** – Closest to calculated value, likely the intended correct answer
  - **Option 4: 156g** – Incorrect

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks about calculating the amount of carbon dioxide produced from a given mass of ethane in a chemical reaction. While framed as a chemistry problem, stoichiometry is a foundational concept in medical biochemistry, particularly in understanding metabolic processes and energy production.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Stoichiometry**: Essential for calculating reactant-to-product ratios in biochemical reactions (e.g., cellular respiration).  
- **Molar Mass Calculations**: Critical for converting between mass and moles, a skill used in drug dosing, metabolic pathway analysis, and biochemical assays.  
- **Balancing Chemical Equations**: Ensures conservation of atoms, a principle applied in studying metabolic pathways and enzyme-catalyzed reactions.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (78g)**: Incorrect.  
  - Calculations show 264g of CO₂, not 78g. This would require an incorrect stoichiometric ratio or miscalculation of molar masses.  
- **Option 2 (528g)**: Incorrect.  
  - This would imply double the correct moles of CO₂ (e.g., using an incorrect balanced equation or molar mass).  
- **Option 3 (264g)**: Correct.  
  - Derived from balanced equation stoichiometry and accurate molar mass calculations.  
- **Option 4 (156g)**: Incorrect.  
  - Suggests half the correct amount of CO₂, likely due to an error in mole ratios or arithmetic.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  

The balanced reaction \( \text{C}_2\text{H}_4 + 3\text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{CO}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} \) shows 1 mole of ethane (\( \text{C}_2\text{H}_4 \)) produces 2 moles of CO₂. Given 84g of ethane (molar mass = 28g/mol), this equals 3 moles. Thus, 3 × 2 = 6 moles of CO₂. The molar mass of CO₂ (44g/mol) gives \( 6 \times 44 = 264g \), making Option 3 the correct answer.

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question requires calculating the mass of carbon dioxide (CO₂) produced from the combustion of 84g of ethane (C₂H₄) with excess oxygen. This involves stoichiometric calculations using the balanced chemical equation and atomic weights provided.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Stoichiometry**: Essential for determining reactant-product ratios in chemical reactions.  
- **Balancing Equations**: Critical for accurate mole-to-mole conversions.  
- **Molar Mass Calculations**: Required to convert grams to moles and vice versa.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Option 1 (78g)**: Incorrect. This would result from miscalculating moles of CO₂ (e.g., using C₂H₆ instead of C₂H₄ or incorrect stoichiometric ratios).  
2. **Option 2 (528g)**: Incorrect. This assumes double the actual moles of CO₂ (e.g., 12 moles instead of 6) or a molar mass error.  
3. **Option 3 (264g)**: Correct. Derived from balanced equation (1 mole C₂H₄ → 2 moles CO₂), 84g C₂H₄ = 3 moles, yielding 6 moles CO₂ (6 × 44g/mol = 264g).  
4. **Option 4 (156g)**: Incorrect. Likely stems from unbalanced stoichiometry (e.g., 1:1 ratio of C₂H₄ to CO₂).  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  
The balanced equation (C₂H₄ + 3O₂ → 2CO₂ + 2H₂O) confirms a 1:2 molar ratio between C₂H₄ and CO₂. With 84g (3 moles) of C₂H₄, 6 moles of CO₂ are produced, totaling 264g (6 × 44g/mol). This aligns with stoichiometric principles and atomic weights.
