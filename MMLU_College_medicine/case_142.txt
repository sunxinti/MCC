问题: 
A patient comes into the hospital after being bit by a dog who he stated was “acting crazy”. The wound is open and bleeding. Animal control captured the dog and said that it was foaming at the mouth and extremely aggressive. Suspecting a rabies infection, the patient is given a serum that contains rabies antibodies that were grown inside a horse. This is an example of what kind of immunity?
选项: 
1. Passive
2. Active
3. Natural
4. Artificial

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is evaluating the type of immunity demonstrated when a patient is administered a serum containing rabies antibodies derived from an external source (specifically, grown inside a horse) following a potential rabies exposure from a dog bite.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Types of Immunity:**
  - **Active Immunity:** This occurs when an individual’s own immune system is stimulated to produce antibodies and memory cells in response to exposure to an antigen, typically through infection or vaccination.
  - **Passive Immunity:** This involves the transfer of pre-formed antibodies from another individual or species, providing immediate but temporary protection against a specific pathogen.
  - **Natural Immunity:** Acquired through natural means, such as exposure to a pathogen leading to infection or through maternal antibodies passed to a fetus.
  - **Artificial Immunity:** Achieved through medical interventions, such as vaccinations (active) or administration of immunoglobulins (passive).
- **Rabies Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP):** In cases of potential rabies exposure, passive immunity is provided through the administration of rabies immune globulin (RIG) alongside the rabies vaccine. RIG offers immediate antibodies to neutralize the virus, while the vaccine stimulates the patient’s own immune response for long-term protection.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Passive:**  
   - **Correct.** The administration of rabies antibodies grown in horses provides passive immunity because the patient receives pre-formed antibodies from an external source without their own immune system being actively involved in producing them.
2. **Active:**  
   - **Incorrect.** Active immunity would require the patient’s immune system to generate its own antibodies, typically through infection or vaccination. In this scenario, antibodies are externally provided.
3. **Natural:**  
   - **Incorrect.** The immunity in this case is acquired through medical intervention, not through natural exposure to the pathogen or maternal antibody transfer.
4. **Artificial:**  
   - **Partially Correct.** While the administration of rabies antibodies is an artificial method of providing immunity, the most specific and accurate classification in this context is "passive" immunity.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks about the type of immunity conferred by administering a serum containing pre-formed rabies antibodies (from a horse) to a patient bitten by a potentially rabid dog. The key concepts involve understanding the classification of immunity types (passive vs. active, natural vs. artificial).

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Passive Immunity**: Provides immediate protection via pre-formed antibodies from an external source (e.g., antiserum, maternal antibodies). It is short-lived because the body does not produce its own antibodies.  
- **Active Immunity**: Involves the body producing its own antibodies in response to an antigen (e.g., vaccines or natural infection). It is long-lasting.  
- **Natural Immunity**: Arises from exposure to an antigen without medical intervention (e.g., recovering from an infection).  
- **Artificial Immunity**: Results from medical interventions (e.g., vaccines or antiserum).  

In this scenario, the patient receives **antibodies directly** (from horse serum) to neutralize the rabies virus. This is a form of **passive immunity** because the patient’s own immune system is not stimulated to produce antibodies. The use of antiserum is also **artificial** (medical intervention), but the question specifically asks for the type of immunity, not the source.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Passive)**: Correct. The serum contains pre-formed antibodies, bypassing the need for the patient’s immune system to generate them.  
- **Option 2 (Active)**: Incorrect. Active immunity requires the body to produce its own antibodies (e.g., via vaccination). The patient here receives antibodies externally.  
- **Option 3 (Natural)**: Incorrect. Natural immunity arises without medical intervention (e.g., infection or maternal antibodies at birth). The antiserum is an artificial intervention.  
- **Option 4 (Artificial)**: Incorrect. While the administration is artificial, this term describes the *source* of immunity, not the *type*. The question asks for the immunity classification (passive vs. active).  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**  

The administration of pre-formed antibodies (from horse serum) directly provides immediate protection without stimulating the patient’s immune system to produce its own antibodies. This is the definition of **passive immunity**. While the intervention is artificial, the question’s phrasing requires selecting the immunity type (passive vs. active), making Option 1 the correct answer.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks to identify the type of immunity conferred by administering rabies antibodies grown in a horse to a patient exposed to rabies. This involves distinguishing between passive/active and natural/artificial immunity.  

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Passive immunity** involves transferring pre-formed antibodies (e.g., maternal antibodies or therapeutic antisera). The recipient does not produce their own antibodies.  
- **Active immunity** occurs when the body generates its own antibodies (e.g., via infection or vaccination).  
- **Natural immunity** is acquired through natural processes (e.g., maternal transfer or infection).  
- **Artificial immunity** results from medical interventions (e.g., vaccines or antibody injections).  

In this case, the patient receives externally produced antibodies (from a horse), which is **passive artificial immunity**.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Passive):** Correct. The patient receives pre-formed antibodies, bypassing their immune system’s need to produce them. This is passive immunity.  
- **Option 2 (Active):** Incorrect. Active immunity requires the body to generate its own antibodies, which does not occur here.  
- **Option 3 (Natural):** Incorrect. Natural passive immunity involves maternal antibody transfer, not externally administered antibodies.  
- **Option 4 (Artificial):** Partially correct but incomplete. While the administration is artificial, the question focuses on the **type** of immunity (passive vs. active), not the method of acquisition.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The primary distinction is passive vs. active immunity. The administration of pre-formed antibodies definitively classifies this as **passive immunity**. The artificial aspect describes the delivery method but does not override the fundamental classification.  

**My final selection is: Option 1**
