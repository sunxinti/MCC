**1. Question Analysis**
- The question focuses on neuromuscular transmission, specifically identifying the substance released when an action potential reaches the motor endplate of a muscle fiber.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**
- **Neuromuscular Junction (NMJ):** This is the synapse between a motor neuron and a skeletal muscle fiber.
- **Action Potential Transmission:** When an action potential arrives at the motor endplate, it triggers the release of neurotransmitters from the motor neuron into the synaptic cleft.
- **Primary Neurotransmitter:** Acetylcholine (ACh) is the main neurotransmitter involved in transmitting the signal across the NMJ to initiate muscle contraction.
- **Role of Ions:** 
  - **Sodium ions (Na⁺):** Involved in generating and propagating the action potential in muscle fibers but are not released by neurons.
  - **Calcium ions (Ca²⁺):** Play a role in the release of ACh from vesicles within the neuron.
  - **Noradrenaline (Norepinephrine):** Primarily a neurotransmitter in the sympathetic nervous system, not typically involved in NMJ transmission.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Acetylcholine which traverses the neuromuscular junction.**
   - **Correct.** Acetylcholine is the primary neurotransmitter released at the NMJ to stimulate muscle contraction.
2. **Sodium ions which binds to sodium receptors on the muscle membrane.**
   - **Incorrect.** While Na⁺ ions are essential for action potential propagation in muscle fibers, they are not the substances released by the motor neuron.
3. **Calcium ions which initiate an action potential along the muscle fibre.**
   - **Incorrect.** Ca²⁺ ions are involved in triggering the release of ACh but are not released themselves to initiate action potentials in muscle fibers.
4. **Noradrenaline which increases muscle metabolic activity.**
   - **Incorrect.** Noradrenaline is not the primary neurotransmitter at the NMJ; it is more involved in the sympathetic nervous system.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks about the physiological process occurring at the motor endplate (neuromuscular junction) when an action potential arrives. Specifically, it focuses on the released substance and its role in muscle activation.  

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Neuromuscular Junction Function**: The motor endplate is the site where motor neurons communicate with skeletal muscle fibers. An action potential in the neuron triggers neurotransmitter release.  
- **Neurotransmitter Involved**: Acetylcholine (ACh) is the primary neurotransmitter at the neuromuscular junction. Its release is calcium-dependent and essential for transmitting the signal to the muscle.  
- **Mechanism**: Calcium influx into the axon terminal triggers vesicle fusion, releasing ACh into the synaptic cleft. ACh then binds nicotinic receptors on the muscle membrane, causing depolarization and initiating an action potential in the muscle fiber.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Correct. Acetylcholine is indeed released from the motor neuron’s axon terminal upon action potential arrival. It traverses the neuromuscular junction to bind muscle receptors.  
- **Option 2**: Incorrect. Sodium ions do not act as neurotransmitters here. Sodium influx occurs later, during the muscle membrane depolarization after ACh binding, but sodium itself is not released from the neuron.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. Calcium ions (Ca²⁺) are involved in triggering ACh release but do not directly initiate the muscle action potential. The muscle action potential is initiated by ACh binding, which opens sodium channels.  
- **Option 4**: Incorrect. Noradrenaline is a neurotransmitter in sympathetic pathways, not at the neuromuscular junction. The junction uses acetylcholine exclusively for signal transmission.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks which substance is released when an action potential reaches the motor endplate. This involves understanding neuromuscular transmission and the role of neurotransmitters in initiating muscle contraction.  

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- At the neuromuscular junction, motor neurons release neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft to activate muscle fibers.  
- **Acetylcholine (ACh)** is the primary neurotransmitter at the neuromuscular junction. When an action potential arrives at the presynaptic terminal, voltage-gated calcium channels open, allowing calcium influx. This triggers synaptic vesicles to fuse with the presynaptic membrane, releasing ACh into the cleft.  
- ACh binds to nicotinic receptors on the muscle membrane, initiating depolarization (via sodium influx) and muscle contraction.  
- Sodium ions (Na⁺) and calcium ions (Ca²⁺) are involved in downstream processes (e.g., muscle action potential and contraction) but are not the substances released by the motor neuron.  
- Noradrenaline is associated with the sympathetic nervous system, not neuromuscular junction signaling.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Correct. Acetylcholine is released from synaptic vesicles into the neuromuscular junction and binds to postsynaptic receptors. This aligns with the mechanism of neuromuscular transmission.  
- **Option 2**: Incorrect. Sodium ions enter the muscle cell during depolarization after ACh binds to receptors but are not released by the motor neuron.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. Calcium ions trigger ACh release from the neuron but are not themselves released into the junction. Muscle action potentials are initiated by sodium influx, not calcium.  
- **Option 4**: Incorrect. Noradrenaline is not involved in neuromuscular junction signaling; it is used in sympathetic synapses.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The only substance directly released by the motor neuron upon arrival of an action potential is acetylcholine. This is a fundamental principle of neuromuscular physiology.  

**My final selection is: Option 1**
