================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is asking about the specific characteristics of fast-twitch muscle fibers, particularly focusing on the number of mitochondria and the level of ATPase activity within these fibers.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Muscle Fiber Types:** There are primarily two types of muscle fibers: slow-twitch (Type I) and fast-twitch (Type II).
- **Mitochondrial Content:** Slow-twitch fibers have a high number of mitochondria to support prolonged, aerobic activities. In contrast, fast-twitch fibers have fewer mitochondria as they rely more on anaerobic metabolism for quick bursts of activity.
- **ATPase Activity:** Fast-twitch fibers exhibit high ATPase activity, which allows for rapid ATP hydrolysis necessary for swift muscle contractions. Slow-twitch fibers have lower ATPase activity, supporting sustained but slower muscle contractions.
- **Functional Implications:** Fast-twitch fibers are designed for short, explosive movements, whereas slow-twitch fibers are suited for endurance and continuous activities.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1:** *A relatively large number of mitochondria and low ATPase activity.*  
  - **Analysis:** This description matches slow-twitch fibers, not fast-twitch fibers. Slow-twitch fibers have more mitochondria and lower ATPase activity.
  - **Conclusion:** Incorrect.

- **Option 2:** *A relatively small number of mitochondria and low ATPase activity.*  
  - **Analysis:** While fast-twitch fibers do have fewer mitochondria, they possess high ATPase activity, not low.
  - **Conclusion:** Incorrect.

- **Option 3:** *A relatively small number of mitochondria and high ATPase activity.*  
  - **Analysis:** This accurately describes fast-twitch fibers, which have fewer mitochondria and high ATPase activity to facilitate rapid contractions.
  - **Conclusion:** Correct.

- **Option 4:** *A relatively large number of mitochondria and high ATPase activity.*  
  - **Analysis:** The high number of mitochondria is characteristic of slow-twitch fibers. Combining this with high ATPase activity does not accurately describe fast-twitch fibers.
  - **Conclusion:** Incorrect.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks about the characteristics of fast-twitch muscle fibers, specifically their mitochondrial content and ATPase activity. This relates to muscle fiber physiology, comparing fast-twitch fibers to slow-twitch fibers.  

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Fast-twitch vs. Slow-twitch Fibers**:  
  - **Fast-twitch fibers** are designed for rapid, powerful, and anaerobic contractions (e.g., sprinting). They rely primarily on glycolysis for ATP production.  
  - **Slow-twitch fibers** are optimized for endurance and aerobic metabolism, containing abundant mitochondria and relying on oxidative phosphorylation.  
- **Mitochondrial Content**: Slow-twitch fibers have a high mitochondrial density to support aerobic respiration. Fast-twitch fibers have fewer mitochondria because they depend less on aerobic pathways.  
- **ATPase Activity**: The ATPase activity of myosin heads in fast-twitch fibers is higher, allowing rapid ATP hydrolysis and faster contraction speeds. This contrasts with slow-twitch fibers, which have lower ATPase activity but greater endurance.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: "Large number of mitochondria and low ATPase activity."  
  - Incorrect. Fast-twitch fibers have fewer mitochondria (not more), and their ATPase activity is high, not low. This matches slow-twitch fiber characteristics.  

- **Option 2**: "Small number of mitochondria and low ATPase activity."  
  - Incorrect. While mitochondria are indeed fewer in fast-twitch fibers, their ATPase activity is high, not low.  

- **Option 3**: "Small number of mitochondria and high ATPase activity."  
  - Correct. Fast-twitch fibers have fewer mitochondria (anaerobic preference) and high ATPase activity (rapid ATP hydrolysis for force generation).  

- **Option 4**: "Large number of mitochondria and high ATPase activity."  
  - Incorrect. This describes a contradictory combination: high mitochondrial content (slow-twitch) paired with high ATPase (fast-twitch).  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  

Fast-twitch fibers are characterized by a low mitochondrial density (due to reliance on anaerobic glycolysis) and high myosin ATPase activity (enabling rapid force generation). These features align perfectly with Option 3.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks about the characteristics of fast-twitch muscle fibers, specifically their mitochondrial content and ATPase activity. This requires knowledge of muscle physiology and fiber-type distinctions.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Fast-twitch (Type II) fibers** are optimized for rapid, powerful contractions but fatigue quickly.  
- **Mitochondria**: These fibers rely more on anaerobic glycolysis (less dependent on mitochondria) compared to slow-twitch fibers, resulting in fewer mitochondria.  
- **ATPase activity**: High myosin ATPase activity enables rapid ATP breakdown, supporting faster cross-bridge cycling and contraction speed.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Incorrect. A large number of mitochondria and low ATPase activity describe slow-twitch (Type I) fibers, not fast-twitch.  
- **Option 2**: Incorrect. While fast-twitch fibers have fewer mitochondria, low ATPase activity contradicts their high-speed contraction mechanism.  
- **Option 3**: Correct. Fast-twitch fibers have fewer mitochondria (due to anaerobic dominance) and high ATPase activity (enabling rapid contractions).  
- **Option 4**: Incorrect. High ATPase activity is correct, but a large mitochondrial count is characteristic of slow-twitch fibers.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  
Fast-twitch fibers are defined by their reliance on anaerobic metabolism (few mitochondria) and rapid ATP utilization (high ATPase activity), making Option 3 the accurate choice.
