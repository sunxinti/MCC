**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is assessing the ability to calculate energy expenditure based on oxygen uptake during exercise. It requires understanding the relationship between oxygen consumption (measured in liters per minute) and the corresponding energy expenditure (measured in kilojoules).

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Oxygen Consumption and Energy Expenditure**: There is a direct relationship between the amount of oxygen consumed and the energy expended by the body. Typically, 1 liter of oxygen consumed is approximately equivalent to 20.1 kJ of energy expended.
- **Calculation Formula**:  
  \[
  \text{Energy (kJ)} = \text{Oxygen Uptake (L/min)} \times \text{Duration (min)} \times \text{Energy per Liter of O}_2
  \]
- **Steady-State Exercise**: The question specifies a steady-rate oxygen uptake, indicating continuous and consistent energy expenditure over the given time period.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Step 1: Calculate Total Oxygen Consumed**  
  \[
  3.0 \, \text{L/min} \times 5 \, \text{min} = 15 \, \text{L}
  \]
  
- **Step 2: Calculate Total Energy Expenditure**  
  \[
  15 \, \text{L} \times 20.1 \, \text{kJ/L} = 301.5 \, \text{kJ}
  \]
  
- **Option Evaluation**:
  1. **60 kJ**: Significantly lower than the calculated 301.5 kJ. **Incorrect**.
  2. **150 kJ**: Still lower than the calculated value. **Incorrect**.
  3. **300 kJ**: Closest to the calculated 301.5 kJ. **Correct**.
  4. **500 kJ**: Higher than the calculated value. **Incorrect**.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks for the energy expenditure in kJ based on an athlete's oxygen uptake rate during exercise. It requires knowledge of the relationship between oxygen consumption and energy production, specifically the conversion factor between oxygen volume and energy.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Oxygen Consumption and Energy**: The body uses oxygen to metabolize substrates (carbohydrates, fats, proteins) via cellular respiration, releasing energy. The energy released per liter of oxygen consumed is a fixed value.  
- **Conversion Factor**: The standard conversion is **1 L of O₂ ≈ 21.1 kJ** (this assumes a mixed substrate metabolism; some sources round it to ~20 kJ/L for simplicity).  
- **Calculation Steps**:  
  1. Calculate total oxygen consumed: \( \text{O}_2 \text{ uptake (L/min)} \times \text{Time (min)} \).  
  2. Multiply by the conversion factor (kJ/L) to get total energy expenditure.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (60 kJ)**: Incorrect. This would require an oxygen consumption of \( \frac{60}{21.1} \approx 2.84 \text{ L} \), far below the given 15 L.  
- **Option 2 (150 kJ)**: Incorrect. This implies \( \frac{150}{21.1} \approx 7.11 \text{ L} \), still much lower than the calculated 15 L.  
- **Option 3 (300 kJ)**: Correct. Using \( 15 \text{ L} \times 20 \text{ kJ/L} = 300 \text{ kJ} \), which aligns with rounded conversion factors commonly used in such questions.  
- **Option 4 (500 kJ)**: Incorrect. This would require \( \frac{500}{21.1} \approx 23.7 \text{ L} \), exceeding the calculated oxygen consumption.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks to calculate the total energy expenditure (in kJ) during 5 minutes of exercise, given an oxygen uptake of 3.0 L/min. This requires understanding the relationship between oxygen consumption and energy production in the body.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Energy Equivalent of Oxygen**: The body’s energy expenditure is estimated using the caloric value of oxygen. A widely accepted average is **20.9 kJ per liter of oxygen consumed** (derived from ~5 kcal/L × 4.184 kJ/kcal), assuming a mixed substrate metabolism (carbohydrates and fats).  
- **Total Oxygen Consumption**: Multiply the oxygen uptake rate (3.0 L/min) by the duration (5 min) to determine total oxygen used:  
  **3.0 L/min × 5 min = 15 L**.  
- **Energy Calculation**: Total energy = Oxygen consumed × Energy equivalent per liter:  
  **15 L × 20.9 kJ/L ≈ 313.5 kJ** (rounded to **~300 kJ** for practical estimation).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (60 kJ)**: Incorrect. This would require only **4 kJ/L** (60 kJ ÷ 15 L), far below the standard 20.9 kJ/L.  
- **Option 2 (150 kJ)**: Incorrect. Equates to **10 kJ/L** (150 kJ ÷ 15 L), still too low.  
- **Option 3 (300 kJ)**: Correct. Matches the calculated value using 20 kJ/L (a simplified approximation of 20.9 kJ/L).  
- **Option 4 (500 kJ)**: Incorrect. Requires **~33.3 kJ/L**, which is unrealistically high.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The most accurate answer aligns with the standard energy equivalent of oxygen and the calculated total oxygen consumption.  

**My final selection is: Option 3**
