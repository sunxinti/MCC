================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**

The question examines the consequences of a specific modification in an RNA sequence that encodes a transmembrane protein responsible for facilitating potassium entry into muscle cells. The focus is on determining how the alteration in the RNA sequence affects the resultant protein.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**

- **RNA to Protein Translation**: Understanding how RNA sequences are translated into proteins is crucial. Each set of three nucleotides (codon) in RNA corresponds to a specific amino acid or a stop signal during protein synthesis.
  
- **Types of Mutations**:
  - **Silent Mutation**: A change in the nucleotide sequence that does not alter the amino acid sequence of the protein.
  - **Missense Mutation**: A single nucleotide change results in a different amino acid, potentially altering protein function.
  - **Nonsense Mutation**: A mutation that introduces a premature stop codon, leading to truncated protein synthesis.
  - **Frameshift Mutation**: Insertions or deletions that shift the reading frame, often resulting in a significantly altered and nonfunctional protein.
  
- **Protein Function and Structure**: For transmembrane proteins, proper structure is essential for function. Any alteration in the amino acid sequence can disrupt the protein's ability to transport ions like potassium effectively.

**3. Analysis of Options**

- **Option 1: Absence of the protein**
  - **Evaluation**: This outcome typically results from mutations that prevent protein synthesis entirely, such as introducing a stop codon early in the sequence or causing mRNA degradation. However, the modification described changes a stop codon to a codon for an amino acid, potentially allowing translation to continue rather than halting it.
  - **Conclusion**: Incorrect.

- **Option 2: Production of a similar-sized but dysfunctional protein**
  - **Evaluation**: This would occur if a missense mutation led to a single amino acid change without altering the overall protein length. However, the modification changes a stop codon to an amino acid codon, likely extending the protein.
  - **Conclusion**: Incorrect.

- **Option 3: No change**
  - **Evaluation**: A silent mutation would result in no change in the protein. However, the alteration changes a stop codon to an amino acid codon, which is not silent.
  - **Conclusion**: Incorrect.

- **Option 4: Production of a larger, likely dysfunctional protein**
  - **Evaluation**: The original RNA sequence contains "UAA," which is a stop codon, signaling the termination of protein synthesis. The modification changes "UAA" to "UAC," a codon for tyrosine, allowing translation to continue beyond the original stop point. This would result in an extended protein with additional amino acids, likely disrupting its normal function.
  - **Conclusion**: Correct.

**4. Final Selection**

**My final selection is: Option 4**

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks about the effect of a specific RNA sequence modification on the resulting protein. The original RNA encodes a transmembrane protein involved in potassium entry into muscle cells. The modified RNA has an extra "CC" inserted in the sequence, altering the codons near the end. The task is to determine the most likely outcome of this change based on molecular genetics principles.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **RNA to Protein Translation**: RNA sequences are read in triplets (codons) to produce proteins. A single nucleotide change can alter a codon (missense/nonsense mutation), while insertions/deletions (indels) that are not multiples of three disrupt the reading frame (frameshift mutation).  
- **Stop Codons**: The presence of a stop codon (UAA, UAG, UGA) terminates translation. Removing a stop codon can extend the protein, while introducing a premature stop codon truncates it.  
- **Frameshift vs. Substitution**: Substitutions do not shift the reading frame, whereas insertions or deletions of nucleotides not divisible by three do.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Absence of the protein)**: This would occur if the mutation introduced a premature stop codon early in the sequence. However, the modification shown replaces "UAACAG..." with "UACCAG...", which shifts but does not eliminate the original stop codon. The new sequence still retains a stop codon (UAA) further downstream, so translation would not be entirely blocked. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 2 (Similar-sized but dysfunctional protein)**: If the mutation caused a single amino acid substitution without altering the protein length, this might be plausible. However, the modification here removes the original stop codon (UAA) and introduces two new codons (UAC and CAG) before encountering the next stop codon. This results in a longer protein, not a similar-sized one. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 3 (No change)**: The modified RNA sequence clearly differs from the original, so this is impossible unless the change occurred in a non-coding region (e.g., UTR). However, the question specifies that the RNA normally produces the protein, implying the mutation affects the coding region. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 4 (Production of a larger, likely dysfunctional protein)**: The substitution of "CC" for "AA" in the original sequence changes the first stop codon (UAA) into UAC (tyrosine) and shifts the reading frame for subsequent codons. The new stop codon (UAA) is two codons later, resulting in an extended protein. This extension disrupts the original protein structure, likely impairing its function. **Correct**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  

The modification replaces the original stop codon (UAA) with UAC (tyrosine) and shifts the reading frame for subsequent codons. The next stop codon (UAA) is delayed by two codons (UAC and CAG), leading to a protein that is two amino acids longer. Since transmembrane proteins require precise structural and functional domains, even a small extension can disrupt their ability to facilitate potassium entry, making the protein larger and likely nonfunctional. Frameshift mutations are ruled out because the substitution does not alter the reading frame length (it is a two-nucleotide substitution, not an insertion/deletion). Thus, **Option 4** is the most accurate answer.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question assesses the impact of a single nucleotide change in an RNA sequence on the resulting protein. Specifically, it evaluates whether this modification leads to altered protein size, function, or absence. Understanding codon translation, stop codons, and frameshifts is crucial.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- RNA is translated into protein via codons (triplet nucleotides).  
- **UAA** is a stop codon, terminating translation.  
- Mutation from **UAA** (stop) to **UAC** (tyrosine) removes the termination signal, causing translation to continue until the next in-frame stop codon.  
- Extended translation produces a longer protein. Extra amino acids may disrupt structure/function, especially in transmembrane proteins requiring precise folding.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Absence of the protein):** Incorrect. The mutation eliminates a stop codon but does not prevent translation initiation or cause a frameshift. The protein is still produced, albeit longer.  
- **Option 2 (Similar-sized dysfunctional protein):** Incorrect. Removing a stop codon increases protein length. The size differs, and dysfunction arises from structural disruption, not similar size.  
- **Option 3 (No change):** Incorrect. The codon change (UAA→UAC) alters translation termination, leading to a longer protein.  
- **Option 4 (Larger, dysfunctional protein):** Correct. The modified RNA lacks the original stop codon, resulting in an extended protein. Dysfunction is likely due to improper folding or disrupted potassium channel activity.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  
The mutation replaces a stop codon (UAA) with a tyrosine codon (UAC), causing translation to continue and producing a longer protein. This extension likely disrupts the transmembrane protein’s structure/function, rendering it dysfunctional.
