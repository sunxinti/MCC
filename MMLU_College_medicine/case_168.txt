**1. Question Analysis**
- **Topic:** The question addresses how blood glucose concentrations are affected during prolonged (80-90 minutes) intermittent high-intensity exercise.
- **Objective:** Determine the typical change in blood glucose levels under the specified exercise conditions.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**
- **Glucose Metabolism During Exercise:**
  - **High-Intensity Exercise:** Requires rapid energy production, primarily utilizing glucose through glycolysis.
  - **Intermittent Nature:** Involves periods of intense activity followed by rest or lower-intensity activity, affecting glucose demand and supply.
- **Liver Function:**
  - **Glycogenolysis:** The liver breaks down glycogen into glucose to maintain blood glucose levels during exercise.
  - **Gluconeogenesis:** Synthesis of new glucose molecules as needed.
- **Insulin and Counterregulatory Hormones:**
  - **Insulin:** Decreases to allow more glucose availability for muscles.
  - **Glucagon and Epinephrine:** Increase to promote glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis.
- **Energy Expenditure Over Time:**
  - **Short-Term:** Blood glucose may be maintained or slightly elevated due to hormonal responses.
  - **Long-Term (80-90 minutes):** Continued high demand can lead to a mild decrease in blood glucose as glycogen stores are utilized.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Frequently rises by 1 - 3 mM.**
   - **Evaluation:** During high-intensity exercise, glucose uptake by muscles increases, typically leading to a decrease or stabilization rather than an increase.
   - **Conclusion:** **Incorrect.**
2. **Remains relatively unchanged.**
   - **Evaluation:** While initial phases may see maintenance of glucose levels due to hepatic glucose output, prolonged high-intensity activity often results in a gradual decline.
   - **Conclusion:** **Partially correct but not the most accurate.**
3. **Frequently falls by 1 - 3 mM.**
   - **Evaluation:** Prolonged high-intensity exercise increases glucose utilization. Over 80-90 minutes, blood glucose tends to decrease slightly as glycogen stores are depleted.
   - **Conclusion:** **Correct.**
4. **Falls to hypoglycaemic levels.**
   - **Evaluation:** Hypoglycemia is a severe drop in blood glucose and is unlikely in a generally healthy individual during this duration and type of exercise, unless other factors are present.
   - **Conclusion:** **Incorrect.**

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks about the effect of prolonged (80–90 minutes) intermittent high-intensity exercise on blood glucose levels. It requires understanding how the body regulates glucose metabolism during such exercise, including mechanisms like glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, insulin/glucagon dynamics, and hormonal responses (e.g., epinephrine, cortisol).

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Initial Exercise Response:** During the onset of high-intensity exercise, muscle glucose uptake increases due to insulin-independent mechanisms (e.g., GLUT4 translocation). This can transiently lower blood glucose.  
- **Liver Compensation:** Prolonged exercise activates hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis via hormones like glucagon, epinephrine, and cortisol to maintain blood glucose.  
- **Glycogen Depletion:** Over time (especially in high-intensity exercise), muscle and liver glycogen stores may deplete, reducing the liver’s ability to compensate, leading to a gradual decline in blood glucose.  
- **Hypoglycemia Risk:** Severe drops (below 3.9 mM) are uncommon unless pre-existing conditions or fasting are involved, but moderate decreases (1–3 mM) are plausible in prolonged exercise.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (rises by 1–3 mM):** Unlikely. High-intensity exercise increases glucose uptake by muscles, which typically lowers blood glucose rather than raising it. Liver output may compensate but not to the point of causing a net rise.  
- **Option 2 (remains unchanged):** Partially plausible for short durations, but over 80–90 minutes, sustained glucose utilization likely exceeds hepatic compensation, leading to a modest decline.  
- **Option 3 (falls by 1–3 mM):** Most accurate. Prolonged exercise depletes glycogen stores, reducing hepatic glucose release. The net effect is a moderate drop (1–3 mM) in blood glucose, consistent with studies on prolonged exercise.  
- **Option 4 (falls to hypoglycemic levels):** Incorrect. Hypoglycemia (below 3.9 mM) is rare in non-fasting individuals during exercise unless extreme conditions exist. A 1–3 mM drop from a baseline of ~5 mM would still keep levels above hypoglycemia (e.g., 2–4 mM).  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  
Blood glucose frequently falls by 1–3 mM during 80–90 minutes of intermittent high-intensity exercise due to glycogen depletion and reduced hepatic glucose output, despite compensatory mechanisms. This drop is typically not severe enough to reach hypoglycemic levels in most individuals.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks about changes in blood glucose concentration during 80-90 minutes of intermittent high-intensity exercise. It requires understanding glucose metabolism dynamics during prolonged, intense physical activity, including glycogen utilization, hormonal regulation, and hepatic glucose production.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Energy Systems**: High-intensity exercise primarily relies on anaerobic glycolysis, rapidly depleting muscle glycogen. Intermittent exercise allows partial recovery, shifting to aerobic metabolism during lower-intensity phases.  
- **Hormonal Responses**: Adrenaline and glucagon increase during exercise, stimulating glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis to maintain blood glucose. Cortisol further supports gluconeogenesis.  
- **Glucose Homeostasis**: Muscle glucose uptake increases during exercise, while the liver releases glucose. Prolonged exercise risks glycogen depletion, leading to reliance on hepatic glucose production.  
- **Duration Impact**: After ~60-90 minutes, muscle and liver glycogen stores diminish, potentially reducing blood glucose if production cannot match utilization.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Frequently rises by 1-3 mM)**: While adrenaline-induced glycogenolysis may transiently increase glucose early in exercise, prolonged duration (80-90 minutes) typically leads to depletion of glycogen stores, making a sustained rise unlikely. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 2 (Remains unchanged)**: Hepatic glucose production often matches muscle uptake in moderate-intensity exercise. However, high-intensity intermittent exercise increases glucose demand, and glycogen depletion after 80-90 minutes often exceeds compensatory mechanisms. **Unlikely**.  
- **Option 3 (Frequently falls by 1-3 mM)**: As glycogen stores deplete, hepatic gluconeogenesis may lag behind muscle glucose uptake, leading to a moderate decline. This aligns with studies showing gradual glucose reduction after prolonged high-intensity exercise. **Correct**.  
- **Option 4 (Falls to hypoglycemic levels)**: Hypoglycemia (<3.9 mM) is rare in healthy individuals due to counter-regulatory hormones. A 1-3 mM decrease from normal fasting levels (4-5.5 mM) would not reach hypoglycemia. **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  
During 80-90 minutes of intermittent high-intensity exercise, muscle glycogen depletion and sustained glucose uptake outpace hepatic production, leading to a moderate decline in blood glucose (1-3 mM). This reflects the balance between glycogenolysis/gluconeogenesis and elevated glucose utilization, without reaching hypoglycemia.
