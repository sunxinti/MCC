**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is asking about the ratio of purines to pyrimidines in a double-stranded DNA molecule. It seeks to determine whether this ratio is constant or varies under certain conditions.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Purines and Pyrimidines:** In DNA, purines consist of adenine (A) and guanine (G), while pyrimidines consist of cytosine (C) and thymine (T).
- **Chargaff's Rules:** These rules state that in double-stranded DNA, the amount of adenine equals thymine, and the amount of guanine equals cytosine. Consequently, the total number of purines equals the total number of pyrimidines, maintaining a consistent 1:1 ratio.
- **Genetic Determination:** While the specific sequence of bases is genetically determined, the overall purine to pyrimidine ratio remains balanced due to base-pairing rules.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Variable.**  
   - *Incorrect.* According to Chargaff's rules, the purine to pyrimidine ratio in double-stranded DNA is consistently 1:1, not variable.
2. **Determined by the base sequence in RNA.**  
   - *Incorrect.* RNA does not determine the purine to pyrimidine ratio in DNA. Moreover, RNA typically has uracil (U) instead of thymine (T) and is usually single-stranded.
3. **Genetically determined.**  
   - *Incorrect.* While the DNA sequence is genetically determined, the purine to pyrimidine ratio specifically remains at 1:1 due to base-pairing rules, making this option too vague and not directly addressing the ratio.
4. **Always 1:1.**  
   - *Correct.* This aligns with Chargaff's rules, ensuring that the number of purines equals the number of pyrimidines in double-stranded DNA.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks about the ratio of purines to pyrimidines in a double-stranded DNA molecule. It requires understanding the structural and chemical properties of DNA, specifically base pairing rules and Chargaff’s rules.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **DNA Structure**: DNA is composed of two complementary strands. Each strand is made of nucleotides containing a sugar-phosphate backbone and nitrogenous bases (adenine, thymine, guanine, cytosine).  
- **Base Pairing Rules**: Adenine (A, a purine) pairs with thymine (T, a pyrimidine), and guanine (G, a purine) pairs with cytosine (C, a pyrimidine). This ensures that the number of purines (A + G) equals the number of pyrimidines (T + C) in the entire double-stranded DNA molecule.  
- **Chargaff’s Rules**: These state that in double-stranded DNA, the amount of adenine equals thymine, and guanine equals cytosine. Consequently, the total purine (A + G) content equals the total pyrimidine (T + C) content, resulting in a purine:pyrimidine ratio of 1:1.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (variable)**: Incorrect. The ratio of purines to pyrimidines in double-stranded DNA is fixed due to complementary base pairing. Variability would only occur in single-stranded DNA or RNA.  
- **Option 2 (determined by RNA base sequence)**: Incorrect. RNA’s base sequence is unrelated to DNA’s purine-pyrimidine ratio, which is governed by DNA’s own base pairing rules.  
- **Option 3 (genetically determined)**: Incorrect. While the base sequence itself is genetically determined, the 1:1 ratio is a structural consequence of base pairing, not a genetic variable.  
- **Option 4 (always 1:1)**: Correct. Due to the complementary pairing of purines with pyrimidines (A-T and G-C), the total purine and pyrimidine counts must always be equal in double-stranded DNA.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks about the ratio of purines to pyrimidines in a double-stranded DNA molecule. This requires understanding DNA structure and base-pairing rules.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **DNA Structure**: DNA is composed of two antiparallel strands held together by hydrogen bonds between complementary bases.  
- **Purines and Pyrimidines**: Purines (adenine [A] and guanine [G]) pair with pyrimidines (thymine [T] and cytosine [C]) via Chargaff's rules: A pairs with T, and G pairs with C.  
- **Base Pairing**: In double-stranded DNA, the number of purines (A + G) equals the number of pyrimidines (T + C) because each purine is paired with a pyrimidine. Thus, the **total purine:pyrimidine ratio is always 1:1** in a double-stranded molecule.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (variable)**: Incorrect. The 1:1 ratio is fixed due to complementary base pairing in double-stranded DNA.  
- **Option 2 (determined by RNA base sequence)**: Incorrect. RNA sequences (single-stranded and containing uracil) do not influence DNA’s purine:pyrimidine ratio.  
- **Option 3 (genetically determined)**: Incorrect. The ratio is a universal structural feature of DNA, not dependent on genetic variation.  
- **Option 4 (always 1:1)**: Correct. Base-pairing rules ensure equal numbers of purines and pyrimidines in double-stranded DNA.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  
The strict complementary base pairing in double-stranded DNA ensures that purines (A + G) always equal pyrimidines (T + C), resulting in a fixed 1:1 ratio. This principle is fundamental to DNA structure and universally applies.
