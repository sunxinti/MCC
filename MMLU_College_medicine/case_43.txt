**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question assesses the types of social mobility experienced by an individual through different stages of his career. It focuses on understanding intergenerational and intragenerational mobility, as well as upward and horizontal mobility.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- While the question is presented in a medical college context, it primarily relates to sociological concepts of social mobility rather than medical principles. Understanding terms like intergenerational mobility (movement between generations), intragenerational mobility (movement within one's lifetime), upward mobility (improvement in social status), and horizontal mobility (movement within the same social status) is essential.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1:** Intergenerational mobility with respect to the father, horizontal mobility, horizontal mobility  
  - Incorrect. The first transition is upward, not horizontal.
  
- **Option 2:** Intragenerational mobility with respect to the son, upward mobility, upward mobility  
  - Incorrect. The first transition is intergenerational, not intragenerational.
  
- **Option 3:** Intergenerational mobility with respect to the father, upward mobility, horizontal mobility  
  - Correct. The man's career progression from bricklayer's son to tenured professor represents intergenerational and upward mobility. Moving to a new tenured position across the country typically signifies horizontal mobility within the same professional status.
  
- **Option 4:** Intragenerational mobility with respect to the son, horizontal mobility, upward mobility  
  - Incorrect. The first transition is intergenerational, and the sequence of mobility types does not align accurately.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question assesses understanding of sociological concepts related to occupational mobility. While not directly a medical concept, occupational mobility is relevant in medical sociology, public health, and social determinants of health. The question requires distinguishing between intergenerational vs. intragenerational mobility and upward vs. horizontal mobility.  

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Intergenerational mobility**: Refers to differences in social status between parents and their offspring.  
- **Intragenerational mobility**: Refers to changes in social status *within* an individual's own career/lifetime.  
- **Upward mobility**: Movement to a higher social or occupational status.  
- **Horizontal mobility**: Movement to a similar position in a different setting without a significant change in status.  

In medical contexts, occupational mobility impacts health outcomes, access to care, and socioeconomic disparities.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Incorrect.  
  - The first part ("intergenerational mobility with respect to the father") is correct because the son's career (medical school teacher) is higher status than his father's (bricklayer).  
  - The second and third parts incorrectly label promotions and geographic moves as "horizontal mobility." However, the promotion to tenured professor (upward) and moving to another tenured position (horizontal) would require "upward" then "horizontal," not two horizontals.  

- **Option 2**: Incorrect.  
  - The first part incorrectly uses "intragenerational mobility with respect to the son," which is redundant and incorrect. Mobility relative to the father is inherently intergenerational.  
  - The second and third parts ("upward mobility, upward mobility") are partially correct for the promotion but incorrectly label the geographic move as upward rather than horizontal.  

- **Option 3**: Correct.  
  - "Intergenerational mobility with respect to the father" is accurate (son’s higher-status career vs. father’s bricklaying).  
  - "Upward mobility" for the promotion to tenured professor is correct (intragenerational upward).  
  - "Horizontal mobility" for moving to another tenured position is correct (same status, different location).  

- **Option 4**: Incorrect.  
  - The first part incorrectly uses "intragenerational mobility with respect to the son," which mislabels the intergenerational comparison.  
  - The sequence "horizontal mobility, upward mobility" misapplies terms: the first career move (teacher to tenured professor) is upward, not horizontal.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  

The sequence correctly identifies:  
1. **Intergenerational mobility**: The son’s career (medical school professor) is higher status than his father’s (bricklayer).  
2. **Upward mobility**: Promotion to tenured professor within his career (intragenerational).  
3. **Horizontal mobility**: Relocating to another institution while retaining the same tenured status.  

This aligns precisely with sociological definitions of mobility types.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question assesses understanding of social mobility types (intergenerational vs. intragenerational; upward vs. horizontal) in the context of career progression. While not strictly a medical concept, it is relevant to medical sociology, which is often included in medical education curricula.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Intergenerational mobility**: Change in social status compared to one’s parents (e.g., son’s occupation vs. father’s).  
- **Intragenerational mobility**: Change in social status within an individual’s own lifetime.  
- **Upward mobility**: Advancement to a higher socioeconomic position.  
- **Horizontal mobility**: Lateral movement without a change in socioeconomic status.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Incorrect. The first step (son becoming a teacher) is intergenerational upward mobility (correct). However, the second step (promotion to tenured professor) is intragenerational *upward* mobility, not horizontal. The third step (same rank at a new school) is horizontal (correct).  
- **Option 2**: Incorrect. The first step is intergenerational (son vs. father), not intragenerational. The second and third steps are correctly classified as upward, but the first classification invalidates this option.  
- **Option 3**: Correct.  
  - Step i: Intergenerational upward mobility (son’s teaching role vs. father’s bricklayer role).  
  - Step ii: Intragenerational upward mobility (promotion to tenured professor).  
  - Step iii: Horizontal mobility (same rank at a new institution).  
- **Option 4**: Incorrect. The first step is misclassified as intragenerational. The third step (same rank at a new school) is horizontal, not upward.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  
The sequence aligns with the definitions: intergenerational upward mobility (son vs. father), intragenerational upward mobility (promotion), and horizontal mobility (lateral move). This matches Option 3’s structure.
