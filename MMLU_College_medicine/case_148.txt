**1. Question Analysis**

The question assesses the application of **attachment theory** in understanding which child is most likely to form an attachment with a previously unknown male psychologist during a psychological study. It seeks to determine how different factors such as the child’s age, gender, and caregiving environment influence the likelihood of forming a new attachment.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**

- **Attachment Theory**: Developed by John Bowlby, this theory emphasizes the importance of the bond between a child and their primary caregiver. It categorizes attachment styles as secure, anxious-ambivalent, avoidant, and disorganized.
  
- **Secure Attachment**: Results from consistent and responsive caregiving, leading to children who feel safe exploring their environment but seek comfort from their caregiver when distressed.

- **Insecure Attachment**: Can result from inconsistent or neglectful caregiving, making children more anxious, avoidant, or disorganized in their relationships.

- **Age and Attachment**: Younger infants (e.g., 2-5 months) are in the early stages of forming attachments and may be more receptive to new caregivers. Older infants (e.g., 13 months) have more established attachment patterns, which can influence their openness to new attachments.

- **Impact of Neglect**: Children who experience neglect may exhibit anxious or disorganized attachment styles, potentially making them more likely to seek new attachments for the care and attention they lack.

**3. Analysis of Options**

- **Option 1: A two-month-old female infant raised in a safe, stable environment**
  - *Assessment*: At two months, the infant is in the early stages of attachment formation but in a safe, stable environment likely has a secure attachment with primary caregivers. May be less likely to form a new attachment quickly with an unfamiliar adult.
  - *Conclusion*: Less likely to attach to the psychologist.

- **Option 2: A five-month-old male infant raised in a safe, stable environment**
  - *Assessment*: At five months, attachment behaviors are emerging, but a secure environment fosters existing attachments. Similar to Option 1, less likely to form a new attachment rapidly with a stranger.
  - *Conclusion*: Less likely to attach to the psychologist.

- **Option 3: An eight-month-old male infant raised by a single caregiver who frequently neglects the child**
  - *Assessment*: Frequent neglect can lead to insecure (anxious or disorganized) attachment styles. Such children may be more receptive to forming new attachments as they seek consistent care and attention.
  - *Conclusion*: More likely to attach to the psychologist.

- **Option 4: A thirteen-month-old female infant raised by two caregivers who occasionally neglect the child**
  - *Assessment*: At thirteen months, attachment patterns are more established. Occasional neglect may lead to some insecurity, but the presence of two caregivers might provide some stability. May still form new attachments but less so compared to a child with frequent neglect.
  - *Conclusion*: Moderately likely to attach, but not as much as Option 3.

**4. Final Selection**

**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question examines attachment theory, specifically which child is most likely to form an attachment to a stranger (a male psychologist) during a study. Key considerations include the age at which attachment typically develops, the quality of the child's existing caregiving environment, and how neglect affects attachment formation.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Attachment Theory Basics**: Secure attachment typically forms between 6–8 months of age. Infants in this window start to show preferences for primary caregivers and exhibit distress when separated.  
- **Neglect and Attachment**: Neglectful caregiving can disrupt secure attachment formation. Children in unstable or neglectful environments may exhibit insecure attachments (e.g., ambivalent, avoidant, or disorganized) or form attachments more readily to alternative caregivers if their primary caregivers are unavailable or unresponsive.  
- **Age-Related Factors**: Infants under 6 months lack the capacity for secure attachment. By 8 months, they are in the critical period for forming attachments. Older infants (e.g., 13 months) may have already established primary attachments, even with occasional neglect.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (2-month-old in a safe environment)**: Too young to form any attachment. Attachment behaviors emerge around 6–8 months. Incorrect.  
- **Option 2 (5-month-old in a safe environment)**: Still pre-attachment stage (before 6 months). May show social responsiveness but not a secure attachment. Incorrect.  
- **Option 3 (8-month-old with neglectful single caregiver)**: At 8 months, the child is in the critical attachment period. Neglectful caregiving disrupts secure attachment formation, making the child more likely to form an attachment to a responsive stranger (the psychologist) who provides attention and care. Correct.  
- **Option 4 (13-month-old with occasional neglect)**: By 13 months, the child likely has an established primary attachment (even with occasional neglect). The child may resist forming an attachment to a stranger due to existing bonds. Incorrect.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  

**Explanation**: An 8-month-old in a neglectful environment is at the critical age for attachment formation (6–8 months) and lacks a secure base due to caregiver neglect. This combination makes the child more likely to seek and form an attachment to a responsive stranger (the psychologist) who provides consistent attention. The other options are either too young (Options 1 and 2) or have already established primary attachments (Option 4).

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which child is most likely to form an attachment to an unfamiliar male psychologist, based on attachment theory. Key factors include the child’s age (developmental stage of attachment formation) and their caregiving environment (secure vs. insecure attachment patterns).  

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Attachment Theory Phases**:  
  1. **Pre-attachment (0-6 weeks)**: Infants respond to caregivers indiscriminately.  
  2. **Attachment-in-the-making (6 weeks to 6-8 months)**: Preferences for familiar caregivers develop.  
  3. **Clear-cut attachment (6-8 months to 18-24 months)**: Specific attachments form, with separation/stranger anxiety emerging.  
- **Stranger Anxiety**: Peaks around 8-10 months, making older infants wary of unfamiliar individuals.  
- **Insecure Attachment**: Neglectful caregiving can lead to insecure attachment styles (avoidant, resistant, disorganized), which may influence how a child interacts with strangers.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (2-month-old, secure environment)**:  
  - In the pre-attachment phase, no specific attachments yet. While open to interaction, attachment formation requires consistent care over time, which is unlikely in a short study.  
  - **Incorrect**.  

- **Option 2 (5-month-old, secure environment)**:  
  - Entering the attachment-in-the-making phase, developing preferences for primary caregivers. Stranger anxiety is not yet prominent, but secure attachment to existing caregivers reduces likelihood of attaching to a stranger.  
  - **Incorrect**.  

- **Option 3 (8-month-old, neglected)**:  
  - In the clear-cut attachment phase. Neglect leads to insecure attachment (likely disorganized or avoidant). Despite potential stranger anxiety, the child’s unmet needs may drive them to seek attention from a responsive stranger, overriding initial wariness.  
  - **Correct**.  

- **Option 4 (13-month-old, occasional neglect)**:  
  - Older age means strong stranger anxiety and established insecure attachment. Occasional neglect may not override the child’s wariness of unfamiliar adults.  
  - **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The 8-month-old neglected child (Option 3) is in the critical attachment phase and has experienced unreliable caregiving. This combination increases the likelihood of seeking attachment to a responsive stranger despite developmental stranger anxiety.  

**My final selection is: Option 3**
