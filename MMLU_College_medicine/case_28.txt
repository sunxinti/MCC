**1. Question Analysis**
- The question assesses psychological traits related to self-perception and motivation. It focuses on identifying David's levels of self-esteem, self-efficacy, and locus of control based on his behaviors and feelings as a dedicated cellist.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**
- **Self-Esteem:** Refers to an individual’s overall subjective emotional evaluation of their own worth.

Understanding these psychological constructs is essential for evaluating David's behavior and emotional state.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Low self-esteem, strong self-efficacy, internal locus of control**

   - **External Locus of Control:** Contradicted by his internal drive and perfectionism.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question assesses understanding of psychological constructs: self-esteem, self-efficacy, and locus of control. It requires analyzing David’s traits (perfectionism, self-criticism, comparison to others) to determine their alignment with these concepts.  

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Self-Esteem**: A person’s overall sense of self-worth. Low self-esteem involves negative self-perception despite external achievements.  
- **Self-Efficacy**: Belief in one’s capability to perform a task successfully. Strong self-efficacy indicates confidence in one’s abilities.  
- **Locus of Control**: Internal locus means individuals believe they control outcomes through their actions; external locus attributes outcomes to outside forces.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Low self-esteem, strong self-efficacy, internal locus of control):**  
  - **Self-Esteem**: David’s perfectionism and harsh self-criticism suggest he views himself negatively (low self-esteem), as he feels inadequate when not mastering pieces.  
  - **Self-Efficacy**: Despite setbacks, he persists in practicing and aims for proficiency, indicating belief in his ability to succeed (strong self-efficacy).  
  - **Locus of Control**: His focus on self-improvement and self-blame for failures imply an internal locus (he attributes outcomes to his efforts).  
  - **Verdict**: Consistent with the scenario.  

- **Option 2 (High self-esteem, strong self-efficacy, internal locus):**  
  - **Self-Esteem**: Contradicted by his self-criticism and comparison to others, which suggest he does not view himself positively.  
  - **Verdict**: Incorrect.  

- **Option 3 (Low self-esteem, strong self-efficacy, external locus):**  
  - **Locus of Control**: External locus would involve blaming external factors for failures (e.g., “the music is too hard”), but David criticizes himself, indicating an internal locus.  
  - **Verdict**: Incorrect.  

- **Option 4 (Low self-esteem, low self-efficacy, internal locus):**  
  - **Self-Efficacy**: Low self-efficacy would mean he doubts his ability to master tasks, but David is actively working to improve, implying confidence in his capacity to succeed.  
  - **Verdict**: Incorrect.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**  

David’s traits align with **low self-esteem** (due to self-criticism and comparison to others), **strong self-efficacy** (as he persists in mastering difficult tasks), and **internal locus of control** (he attributes outcomes to his own efforts). The other options misrepresent his self-esteem (Option 2), locus of control (Option 3), or self-efficacy (Option 4).

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question assesses understanding of psychological constructs: **self-esteem**, **self-efficacy**, and **locus of control** in the context of David’s behavior and mindset.  

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Self-esteem**: Reflects self-worth. Low self-esteem may manifest as self-criticism despite achievements.  
- **Self-efficacy**: Confidence in one’s ability to execute tasks. Strong self-efficacy drives persistence despite challenges.  
- **Locus of control**: Internal = outcomes attributed to personal effort; external = outcomes attributed to external factors.  
- **Perfectionism**: Often linked to internal locus of control (self-blame for failures) and low self-esteem (chronic dissatisfaction with performance).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**:  
  - **Low self-esteem**: Consistent with David’s self-critical nature and comparison to "better players."  
  - **Strong self-efficacy**: Supported by his persistence in mastering difficult sections (belief in his ability to improve).  
  - **Internal locus of control**: Aligns with his self-blame for failures (attributing outcomes to his own efforts).  
  - **Correct**.  

- **Option 2**:  
  - **High self-esteem**: Contradicts his harsh self-judgment. Achievement ≠ high self-esteem if self-perception is negative.  
  - **Incorrect**.  

- **Option 3**:  
  - **External locus of control**: Incorrect. David blames himself, not external factors (e.g., luck or difficulty of music).  
  - **Incorrect**.  

- **Option 4**:  
  - **Low self-efficacy**: Incorrect. David’s determination to master pieces indicates strong belief in his ability to succeed.  
  - **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
- David exhibits **low self-esteem** (due to chronic self-criticism), **strong self-efficacy** (persistence in practicing), and **internal locus of control** (self-blame for failures). These traits align with **Option 1**.  

**My final selection is: Option 1**
