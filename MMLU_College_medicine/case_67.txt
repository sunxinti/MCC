**1. Question Analysis**
- The question focuses on therapeutic strategies aimed at enhancing self-esteem and self-efficacy in a college student named Karen. It specifically asks which of the provided options would **not** be a strategy her therapist would use to raise her sense of self-efficacy.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**
- **Self-Efficacy**: A concept introduced by Albert Bandura, referring to an individual's belief in their ability to succeed in specific situations or accomplish tasks.
- **Sources of Self-Efficacy**:
  1. **Mastery Experiences**: Successfully performing tasks to build confidence.
  2. **Vicarious Experiences**: Observing others succeed, which can strengthen one's belief in their own abilities.
  3. **Verbal Persuasion**: Receiving encouragement and positive feedback to boost confidence.
  4. **Physiological States**: Managing stress and emotional states to maintain a positive outlook.

**3. Analysis of Options**

1. **Seek positive feedback from friends.**
   - **Analysis**: Aligns with **Verbal Persuasion**. Positive feedback can enhance self-belief.
   - **Conclusion**: **Correct strategy** to raise self-efficacy.

2. **Put in daily practice on the tasks she wishes to improve on.**
   - **Analysis**: Aligns with **Mastery Experiences**. Regular practice leads to skill improvement and increased confidence.
   - **Conclusion**: **Correct strategy** to raise self-efficacy.

3. **Find others her age and ability who excel at tasks she is interested in.**
   - **Analysis**: Aligns with **Vicarious Experiences**. Observing peers can inspire and reinforce self-belief.
   - **Conclusion**: **Correct strategy** to raise self-efficacy.

4. **Avoid potential pitfalls by withholding from tasks she is not proficient in.**
   - **Analysis**: This approach promotes avoidance, which can hinder the development of mastery and reduce opportunities for building self-efficacy.
   - **Conclusion**: **Incorrect strategy**; it does not support the enhancement of self-efficacy.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question focuses on identifying a strategy that would NOT contribute to enhancing self-efficacy, a psychological concept central to Albert Bandura’s social cognitive theory. Self-efficacy refers to an individual’s belief in their ability to succeed in specific situations. The question requires distinguishing between evidence-based strategies that foster self-efficacy and those that undermine it.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Self-Efficacy Sources (Bandura):**  
  1. **Mastery experiences (direct experience of success).**  
  2. **Vicarious experiences (observing others succeed).**  
  3. **Verbal persuasion (receiving encouragement).**  
  4. **Psychological/physiological states (managing stress/arousal).**  

- **Therapeutic Strategies for Self-Efficacy:**  
  Therapists typically encourage activities that align with these sources, such as practicing skills (mastery), seeking role models (vicarious), and obtaining positive feedback (verbal persuasion). Avoiding challenging tasks contradicts mastery experiences and prevents skill development, thereby harming self-efficacy.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1:** Seeking positive feedback aligns with verbal persuasion, a valid strategy to boost self-efficacy. **Correct strategy.**  
- **Option 2:** Daily practice on desired tasks directly supports mastery experiences, the strongest source of self-efficacy. **Correct strategy.**  
- **Option 3:** Observing peers who excel provides vicarious experiences, reinforcing belief in one’s own capabilities. **Correct strategy.**  
- **Option 4:** Avoiding tasks due to lack of proficiency prevents mastery experiences and skill-building, weakening self-efficacy. **Incorrect strategy.**  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  

Avoiding tasks one is not proficient in directly contradicts the foundational principle of self-efficacy development, which requires confronting challenges and learning through experience. This strategy would hinder rather than enhance self-efficacy.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks which strategy a therapist would NOT use to enhance Karen's self-efficacy. Self-efficacy refers to one's belief in their ability to succeed in specific situations, rooted in Bandura's theory. The incorrect strategy would contradict established methods for building self-efficacy.  

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Self-efficacy strategies** include:  
  1. **Mastery experiences** (practicing tasks to build competence).  
  2. **Vicarious experiences** (observing similar others succeed).  
  3. **Verbal persuasion** (receiving encouragement).  
  4. **Managing physiological/emotional states** (e.g., reducing stress).  
- Avoiding challenges undermines mastery experiences, a core mechanism for improving self-efficacy.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Seeking positive feedback aligns with **verbal persuasion**, a validated strategy. **Correct strategy**.  
- **Option 2**: Daily practice fosters **mastery experiences**, directly enhancing self-efficacy. **Correct strategy**.  
- **Option 3**: Observing peers (vicarious experiences) boosts confidence through modeled success. **Correct strategy**.  
- **Option 4**: Avoiding tasks prevents mastery and reinforces fear of failure, reducing self-efficacy. **Incorrect strategy**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
- **My final selection is: Option 4**  
  Avoiding tasks limits opportunities for growth and mastery, which are essential for building self-efficacy. Therapists encourage gradual exposure to challenges, not avoidance.
