**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is assessing the fundamental genetic mechanism that determines the sex of a child. It focuses on the specific chromosomal inheritance that dictates whether the offspring will be male or female.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- Human sex determination is primarily governed by the combination of sex chromosomes inherited from the parents.
- Females have two X chromosomes (XX), while males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY).
- The mother always contributes an X chromosome, whereas the father can contribute either an X or a Y chromosome.
- The presence of the Y chromosome, specifically the SRY gene on the Y chromosome, triggers male development.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **the number of X chromosomes from the mother.**
   - Incorrect. While the mother always contributes one X chromosome, the sex of the child is determined by whether the father contributes an X or a Y chromosome, not by the number of X chromosomes from the mother.
2. **a recessive allele on the X chromosome.**
   - Incorrect. Recessive alleles on the X chromosome are related to certain genetic conditions, not directly to sex determination.
3. **a single Y chromosome from the mother.**
   - Incorrect. Mothers do not carry a Y chromosome; they carry two X chromosomes.
4. **a single Y chromosome from the father.**
   - Correct. The father’s contribution of either an X or a Y chromosome determines the sex of the child. An X results in a female (XX), and a Y results in a male (XY).

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks about the genetic mechanism determining a child's sex, focusing on the inheritance pattern of specific chromosomes from parents. It requires knowledge of sex chromosomes and their transmission during fertilization.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- Human sex is determined by the presence of the Y chromosome.  
- Females have two X chromosomes (XX), while males have one X and one Y (XY).  
- The mother contributes one X chromosome (since she is XX).  
- The father contributes either an X or Y chromosome (since he is XY).  
- A child’s sex is determined solely by the sperm’s contribution: an X from the father results in a female (XX), while a Y results in a male (XY).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Incorrect. The mother can only contribute one X chromosome (since she is XX). The number of X chromosomes from the mother does not vary, so it cannot dictate sex.  
- **Option 2**: Incorrect. Sex is not determined by recessive alleles on the X chromosome. Recessive alleles may influence sex-linked traits but do not determine sex itself.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. The mother cannot contribute a Y chromosome because she has two X chromosomes.  
- **Option 4**: Correct. The father’s sperm determines the child’s sex by contributing either an X or Y chromosome. A Y chromosome from the father results in a male (XY), while an X results in a female (XX).  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which factor dictates the sex of a child, focusing on genetic inheritance. This requires understanding human chromosomal sex determination, specifically the roles of X and Y chromosomes from parental gametes.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- Human sex determination follows an XY system: females are **46,XX** and males **46,XY**.  
- Mothers contribute **only X chromosomes** (via oocytes, as they are XX). Fathers contribute **X or Y chromosomes** (via sperm, as they are XY).  
- The **presence of a Y chromosome** determines male development due to the *SRY* gene on the Y chromosome, which triggers testis formation. Without a Y chromosome (XX), ovaries develop.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1**: Incorrect. Mothers always contribute one X chromosome. The number of X chromosomes (one from mother, one from father) does not dictate sex; the presence of a Y does.  
- **Option 2**: Incorrect. Sex determination is not based on recessive alleles but on the presence/absence of the Y chromosome. This option conflates X-linked recessive disorders (e.g., hemophilia) with sex determination.  
- **Option 3**: Incorrect. Mothers lack Y chromosomes (they are XX) and cannot transmit a Y chromosome.  
- **Option 4**: Correct. Fathers produce sperm with either X or Y chromosomes. A Y-bearing sperm fertilizing the X-bearing egg results in a male (XY). The Y chromosome’s presence is the sole determinant of male sex.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The sex of a child is determined by whether the sperm contributes an X or Y chromosome. Since mothers cannot provide a Y chromosome, the father’s contribution of a Y chromosome (option 4) is the critical factor.  

**My final selection is: Option 4**
