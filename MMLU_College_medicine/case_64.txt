**1. Question Analysis**  
- **Topic:** The question assesses the relationship between oxygen consumption and energy expenditure in a male athlete during a training session.
- **Focus:** It requires calculating the rate of energy expenditure based on the given oxygen consumption rate.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Oxygen Consumption and Energy Expenditure:** The rate of oxygen consumption (VO₂) is directly related to energy expenditure. In physiology, it's established that approximately 1 liter of oxygen consumed equates to about 5 kilocalories (kcal) of energy expended.
- **Unit Conversion:** Since the options are in kilojoules (kJ), it's essential to convert kcal to kJ. The conversion factor is 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ.
- **Calculation Principle:** Energy Expenditure (kJ/min) = VO₂ (l/min) × Energy per liter of O₂ (kcal/l) × Conversion factor (kJ/kcal).

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: 400 kJ/min.**
  - **Calculation:** 2 l/min × 5 kcal/l = 10 kcal/min; 10 kcal/min × 4.184 kJ/kcal = 41.84 kJ/min.
  - **Conclusion:** Significantly higher than the calculated value. **Incorrect.**
  
- **Option 2: 200 kJ/min.**
  - **Calculation:** As above, the correct value is approximately 41.84 kJ/min.
  - **Conclusion:** Still much higher than the correct value. **Incorrect.**
  
- **Option 3: 80 kJ/min.**
  - **Calculation:** The calculated value is about half of this option.
  - **Conclusion:** Higher than the accurate estimate. **Incorrect.**
  
- **Option 4: 40 kJ/min.**
  - **Calculation:** Closest to the calculated value of approximately 41.84 kJ/min.
  - **Conclusion:** Aligns well with the accurate estimation. **Correct.**

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks for the rate of energy expenditure in a male athlete based on his oxygen consumption rate. It requires applying the relationship between oxygen consumption and energy expenditure, a key concept in exercise physiology and bioenergetics.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Oxygen Consumption and Energy Expenditure:**  
  Oxygen (O₂) consumption is directly related to energy production via aerobic respiration. The standard conversion factor is **1 L of O₂ consumed ≈ 20.1 kJ of energy** (or approximately 5 kcal/L of O₂). This relationship arises because each mole of O₂ supports the production of ATP, with the energy yield from ATP hydrolysis being quantified in kJ.  
- **Calculation Formula:**  
  Energy expenditure (kJ/min) = Oxygen consumption (L/min) × 20.1 kJ/L.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (400 kJ/min):**  
  This would require an oxygen consumption rate of **20 L/min** (since 20 L/min × 20 kJ/L ≈ 400 kJ/min). The given rate is 2 L/min, so this is **incorrect**.  

- **Option 2 (200 kJ/min):**  
  This would require an oxygen consumption rate of **10 L/min** (10 L/min × 20 kJ/L ≈ 200 kJ/min). The given rate is 2 L/min, so this is **incorrect**.  

- **Option 3 (80 kJ/min):**  
  This would require an oxygen consumption rate of **4 L/min** (4 L/min × 20 kJ/L ≈ 80 kJ/min). The given rate is 2 L/min, so this is **incorrect**.  

- **Option 4 (40 kJ/min):**  
  Using the formula:  
  Energy = 2 L/min × 20.1 kJ/L ≈ **40.2 kJ/min**, which closely matches this option. This is **correct**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  

The calculation using the standard conversion factor (20.1 kJ/L of O₂) confirms that 2 L/min of oxygen consumption corresponds to approximately 40 kJ/min of energy expenditure. The other options are inconsistent with this fundamental physiological relationship.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question requires converting oxygen consumption (2 L/min) into energy expenditure (kJ/min) using principles of exercise physiology and metabolic energy equivalents.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- Energy expenditure during metabolism is calculated using the oxygen energy equivalent.  
- Each liter of oxygen consumed yields approximately 5 kcal (varies slightly with substrate: ~5.05 kcal/L for carbohydrates, ~4.7 kcal/L for fats).  
- 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ. Thus, 5 kcal/L ≈ 20.92 kJ/L.  
- During exercise, a simplified value of 20–21 kJ per liter of oxygen is often used for calculations.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (400 kJ/min):** Incorrect. At 2 L/min, even 100 kJ/L would be required, far exceeding standard values (~20 kJ/L).  
- **Option 2 (200 kJ/min):** Incorrect. Equivalent to 100 kJ/L, which is implausibly high.  
- **Option 3 (80 kJ/min):** Incorrect. Implies 40 kJ/L (≈9.5 kcal/L), exceeding physiological energy yield.  
- **Option 4 (40 kJ/min):** Correct. 2 L/min × 20 kJ/L = 40 kJ/min, aligning with standard approximations.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**  
The calculation (2 L/min × 20 kJ/L = 40 kJ/min) matches the approximate energy equivalent of oxygen, making Option 4 the most accurate.
