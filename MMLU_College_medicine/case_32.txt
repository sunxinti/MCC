**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question examines the behavior of sound waves as they transition from one medium to a denser medium. It focuses on how specific properties of sound—velocity, intensity, frequency, and wavelength—are affected during this transition. The task is to identify which property does **not** change when sound moves into a denser medium.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- While the question is rooted in the principles of physics, understanding sound transmission is relevant in medical fields such as audiology and medical imaging (e.g., ultrasound). Sound waves' behavior in different mediums can impact diagnostic techniques and treatments.
- **Velocity:** Sound travels at different speeds in different mediums. Generally, sound moves faster in denser mediums due to the closer proximity of particles facilitating quicker transmission.
- **Intensity:** This refers to the power per unit area carried by the sound wave. Intensity can change when sound enters a new medium due to factors like absorption, reflection, and transmission losses.
- **Frequency:** The frequency of the sound wave, determined by the source, remains constant when transitioning between mediums. Only properties like velocity and wavelength are affected.
- **Wavelength:** Given that velocity changes and frequency remains constant, the wavelength must adjust accordingly to satisfy the relationship \( \text{Velocity} = \text{Frequency} \times \text{Wavelength} \).

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1. Velocity:** Incorrect. The velocity of sound changes when entering a denser medium.
- **Option 2. Intensity:** Incorrect. The intensity can change due to energy loss or increase depending on the medium's properties.
- **Option 3. Frequency:** Correct. The frequency of the sound wave remains unchanged as it is determined by the source and does not depend on the medium.
- **Option 4. Wavelength:** Incorrect. The wavelength changes in response to the change in velocity while maintaining the same frequency.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question examines the properties of sound waves when transitioning from one medium to a denser medium. It asks which property **does not** change during this process. The key concepts involve wave physics, specifically how frequency, velocity, intensity, and wavelength behave at medium interfaces.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Sound Wave Properties**:  
  - **Frequency**: Determined by the source; remains constant when a wave crosses a boundary between media.  
  - **Velocity**: Depends on the medium's physical properties (e.g., elasticity and density). Changes when entering a new medium.  
  - **Intensity**: Proportional to the energy transmitted, which can decrease due to reflection and absorption at the interface.  
  - **Wavelength**: Related to velocity and frequency via \( v = f \lambda \). Since velocity and frequency are independent of wavelength, wavelength changes if velocity changes (frequency remains constant).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (velocity)**: Velocity changes when entering a new medium. For example, sound travels faster in water than in air. **Changes** → Not the exception.  
- **Option 2 (intensity)**: Intensity decreases due to partial reflection and energy loss at the interface. **Changes** → Not the exception.  
- **Option 3 (frequency)**: Frequency is determined by the source and does not depend on the medium. **Does not change** → Potential exception.  
- **Option 4 (wavelength)**: Since \( \lambda = \frac{v}{f} \), wavelength changes when velocity changes (frequency is constant). **Changes** → Not the exception.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  

Frequency remains constant because it is a property of the sound source itself and does not depend on the medium through which the wave travels. All other properties (velocity, intensity, wavelength) are influenced by the medium's characteristics and thus change.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which property of sound remains unchanged when it transitions from one medium to a denser medium. This involves understanding how sound waves behave in different media, focusing on velocity, intensity, frequency, and wavelength.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Frequency**: Determined by the source and remains constant across media.  
- **Velocity**: Depends on the medium's properties (e.g., density, elasticity). Speed increases in stiffer/denser media (e.g., water vs. air).  
- **Wavelength**: Changes proportionally to velocity (via \( v = f\lambda \)) when frequency (\( f \)) is fixed.  
- **Intensity**: Affected by reflection/transmission at the medium boundary, leading to reduced transmitted intensity.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (velocity)**: Changes in a denser medium (e.g., higher speed in water than air). **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 2 (intensity)**: Decreases due to partial reflection at the interface. **Incorrect**.  
- **Option 3 (frequency)**: Remains constant, as it is determined by the source. **Correct**.  
- **Option 4 (wavelength)**: Changes with velocity (since \( \lambda = v/f \)). **Incorrect**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The frequency of a sound wave is intrinsic to its source and does not change when transitioning between media. All other properties (velocity, intensity, wavelength) are medium-dependent.  

**My final selection is: Option 3**
