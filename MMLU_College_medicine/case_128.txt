**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is focused on the biochemical process of glycogenolysis in muscle tissue. It specifically asks about the initial product formed when glycogen is broken down in muscle cells.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Glycogen Breakdown (Glycogenolysis):** Glycogenolysis is the process of breaking down glycogen into glucose units to provide energy, especially during muscle contraction.
- **Enzymatic Steps in Muscle Glycogenolysis:**
  - **Glycogen Phosphorylase:** This enzyme cleaves glycogen into glucose-1-phosphate (G1P) by removing glucose residues from the non-reducing ends of glycogen branches.
  - **Phosphoglucomutase:** G1P is then converted to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), which can enter glycolysis to produce ATP.
- **Differences Between Muscle and Liver:**
  - Unlike the liver, muscle cells lack the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase, meaning G6P cannot be converted back to free glucose in muscle tissues.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Glucose:**  
   - **Incorrect.** In muscle cells, glycogen breakdown does not result in free glucose because muscle lacks glucose-6-phosphatase to dephosphorylate glucose-6-phosphate to glucose.

2. **Glucose-1-Phosphate:**  
   - **Correct.** The initial product of glycogen breakdown in muscle is glucose-1-phosphate, formed by the action of glycogen phosphorylase.

3. **Glucose-6-Phosphate:**  
   - **Incorrect.** While glucose-6-phosphate is a product of the subsequent conversion of glucose-1-phosphate, it is not the initial product formed directly from glycogen breakdown.

4. **Glucose-1,6-Diphosphate:**  
   - **Incorrect.** This molecule is an intermediate in glycolysis but is not directly formed during glycogen breakdown in muscle.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks about the initial product of glycogen breakdown in muscle cells. It requires knowledge of glycogenolysis, the process by which glycogen is broken down into glucose or its derivatives. The key distinction here is between the pathways in muscle versus liver cells and the specific enzymes involved in the first steps of this process.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Glycogenolysis Process**: Glycogen is broken down by the enzyme **glycogen phosphorylase**, which cleaves α-1,4 glycosidic bonds, releasing **glucose-1-phosphate** (G1P) from the non-reducing ends of glycogen chains.  
- **Muscle vs. Liver Differences**:  
  - In **muscle cells**, glycogen breakdown does not result in free glucose because muscles lack **glucose-6-phosphatase**. Instead, G1P is converted to **glucose-6-phosphate (G6P)** via **phosphoglucomutase**.  
  - In **liver cells**, G6P can be further converted to free glucose via glucose-6-phosphatase, but this is irrelevant here since the question specifies muscle.  
- **Initial Product**: The first step in glycogenolysis is always the production of G1P, regardless of the tissue.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (glucose)**: Incorrect. Glycogen phosphorylase cannot directly release free glucose. Muscles cannot dephosphorylate G1P to glucose due to the absence of glucose-6-phosphatase.  
- **Option 2 (glucose-1-phosphate)**: Correct. This is the immediate product of glycogen phosphorylase activity during the first step of glycogen breakdown.  
- **Option 3 (glucose-6-phosphate)**: Incorrect. While G6P is eventually formed in muscle from G1P, it is not the *initial* product of glycogenolysis.  
- **Option 4 (glucose-1,6-diphosphate)**: Incorrect. This molecule is a key intermediate in glycolysis (formed by phosphofructokinase) but is not involved in glycogen breakdown.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks about the initial product formed during glycogen breakdown in muscle tissue. This requires understanding the biochemical pathway of glycogenolysis and its tissue-specific differences.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Glycogenolysis in Muscle**:  
  - Initiated by glycogen phosphorylase, which cleaves α-1,4-glycosidic bonds via phosphorolysis, producing **glucose-1-phosphate** (G1P).  
  - Muscle lacks glucose-6-phosphatase, so glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) cannot be converted to free glucose. Instead, G1P is converted to G6P for glycolysis.  
- **Key Enzymes**:  
  - Glycogen phosphorylase (generates G1P).  
  - Phosphoglucomutase (converts G1P to G6P).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Glucose**  
  - Incorrect. Free glucose is not directly formed in muscle glycogenolysis due to the absence of glucose-6-phosphatase.  
- **Option 2: Glucose-1-phosphate**  
  - Correct. Glycogen phosphorylase directly produces G1P as the initial product.  
- **Option 3: Glucose-6-phosphate**  
  - Incorrect. G6P is formed after phosphoglucomutase acts on G1P, making it a secondary product.  
- **Option 4: Glucose-1,6-diphosphate**  
  - Incorrect. This molecule is involved in glycolysis (e.g., as a cofactor for phosphofructokinase) but is not part of glycogenolysis.  

**4. Final Selection**  
- The initial step of glycogen breakdown in muscle produces glucose-1-phosphate via glycogen phosphorylase. Subsequent conversion to glucose-6-phosphate occurs later.  

**My final selection is: Option 2**
