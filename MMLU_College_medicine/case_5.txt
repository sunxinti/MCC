**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is inquiring about the mechanism by which fatty acids are transported into mitochondria. Specifically, it seeks to identify the molecule to which fatty acids are bound during their transport into the mitochondrial matrix.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- Fatty acid oxidation (beta-oxidation) occurs within the mitochondria, where fatty acids are broken down to produce energy.
- Fatty acids must be transported from the cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix to undergo beta-oxidation.
- The transport mechanism involves conjugation with specific molecules to facilitate crossing the mitochondrial membrane.
- The carnitine shuttle is a critical system for the transport of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria. This system involves the binding of fatty acids to carnitine, forming fatty acylcarnitine, which can then be translocated into the mitochondria.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Thiokinase.**  
   - *Incorrect.* Thiokinase, also known as fatty acyl-CoA synthetase, is responsible for activating fatty acids by converting them to fatty acyl-CoA in the cytosol, not for transporting them into mitochondria.
   
2. **Coenzyme A (CoA).**  
   - *Incorrect.* Coenzyme A binds to fatty acids to form fatty acyl-CoA, which is necessary for beta-oxidation. However, fatty acyl-CoA alone cannot cross the mitochondrial membrane and requires conjugation with carnitine for transport.
   
3. **Acetyl-CoA.**  
   - *Incorrect.* Acetyl-CoA is a product of beta-oxidation and plays a role in the Krebs cycle within the mitochondria, but it is not involved in the transport of fatty acids into mitochondria.
   
4. **Carnitine.**  
   - *Correct.* Carnitine binds to fatty acids to form fatty acylcarnitine, facilitating their transport across the mitochondrial membrane via the carnitine shuttle system.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks about the molecule that binds to fatty acids to facilitate their transport into the mitochondria. This relates to the process of fatty acid oxidation and the mechanisms of mitochondrial transport, which are critical for energy production in cells.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- Fatty acids cannot directly cross the inner mitochondrial membrane due to its hydrophobicity and impermeability.  
- To enter mitochondria, fatty acids are first activated in the cytoplasm by thiokinase (also called acyl-CoA synthetase), forming **acyl-CoA**.  
- However, acyl-CoA cannot cross the mitochondrial membrane. Instead, the fatty acyl group is transferred to **carnitine** via the enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I), forming **acyl-carnitine**, which can diffuse into the mitochondria.  
- Inside the mitochondria, another enzyme (carnitine palmitoyltransferase II, CPT II) transfers the acyl group back to CoA, regenerating **acyl-CoA** for beta-oxidation.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **Thiokinase**: This enzyme catalyzes the activation of fatty acids to form acyl-CoA *in the cytoplasm*, but it does not participate in mitochondrial transport. **Incorrect**.  
2. **Coenzyme A (CoA)**: While fatty acids are initially bound to CoA as acyl-CoA, CoA itself cannot cross the mitochondrial membrane. The transport requires carnitine. **Incorrect**.  
3. **Acetyl-CoA**: This is the product of one round of beta-oxidation *inside the mitochondria* and is unrelated to fatty acid transport into the organelle. **Incorrect**.  
4. **Carnitine**: Acts as the carrier molecule that shuttles fatty acyl groups across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This is the correct mechanism. **Correct**.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks about the molecule that binds to fatty acids to facilitate their transport into mitochondria. This involves understanding the process of fatty acid metabolism, specifically the mechanism of mitochondrial uptake for β-oxidation.  

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- Fatty acids must enter mitochondria to undergo β-oxidation.  
- Free fatty acids are activated in the cytosol by forming acyl-CoA (via **thiokinase**).  
- Acyl-CoA cannot directly cross the mitochondrial membrane.  
- **Carnitine** acts as a carrier: the acyl group is transferred from CoA to carnitine (forming acyl-carnitine), which crosses the inner mitochondrial membrane via the carnitine shuttle.  
- Inside the mitochondria, the acyl group is transferred back to CoA for β-oxidation.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (thiokinase)**: Incorrect. Thiokinase activates fatty acids by binding them to CoA in the cytosol but does not transport them into mitochondria.  
- **Option 2 (Coenzyme A)**: Incorrect. CoA is involved in cytosolic activation (acyl-CoA formation) and mitochondrial β-oxidation but does not mediate transport.  
- **Option 3 (acetyl-CoA)**: Incorrect. Acetyl-CoA is a product of β-oxidation, not a transport molecule.  
- **Option 4 (carnitine)**: Correct. Carnitine binds the acyl group (via acyl-carnitine) to shuttle it across the mitochondrial membrane.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The transport of fatty acids into mitochondria relies on the carnitine shuttle system. Carnitine is the essential carrier molecule, making **Option 4** the correct answer.  

**My final selection is: Option 4**
