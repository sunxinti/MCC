**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is asking to identify which of the listed sensory systems are chemically based. Specifically, it requires distinguishing between sensory systems that respond to chemical stimuli versus those that respond to other types of stimuli.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Sensory Systems Classification:** Sensory systems are categorized based on the type of stimuli they detect:
  - **Chemically Based Sensory Systems:** These systems respond to chemical stimuli. The two primary chemically based sensory systems in humans are:
    - **Gustatory System:** Responsible for the perception of taste. It detects dissolved chemicals in the mouth.
    - **Olfactory System:** Responsible for the perception of smell. It detects airborne chemical molecules.
  - **Mechanically Based Sensory Systems:** These systems respond to mechanical stimuli such as sound waves or pressure changes.
    - **Auditory System:** Responsible for hearing. It detects sound waves, which are mechanical vibrations transmitted through the air.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1. I only**
  - **Gustatory system** is chemically based.
  - However, this option excludes the olfactory system, which is also chemically based.
  - **Incorrect.**
  
- **Option 2. II only**
  - **Auditory system** is not chemically based; it is mechanically based.
  - **Incorrect.**
  
- **Option 3. III only**
  - **Olfactory system** is chemically based.
  - However, this option excludes the gustatory system, which is also chemically based.
  - **Incorrect.**
  
- **Option 4. I and III only**
  - **Gustatory system** (I) and **Olfactory system** (III) are both chemically based sensory systems.
  - This option correctly includes all chemically based systems listed.
  - **Correct.**

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which sensory systems are chemically based. The options include gustatory (taste), auditory (hearing), and olfactory (smell) systems. The key is to differentiate between sensory systems that rely on chemical interactions (e.g., binding of molecules to receptors) versus those dependent on physical stimuli (e.g., vibrations, pressure).

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Chemically based sensory systems** involve detection of specific molecules through receptor proteins. Examples include taste (gustatory) and smell (olfactory), where molecules (tastants and odorants) bind to receptors, triggering neural signals.  
- **Mechanically based systems**, such as hearing (auditory), rely on physical displacement of structures (e.g., sound waves vibrating the cochlea’s hair cells) to generate neural impulses.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **I. Gustatory system**: Correct. Taste receptors in the tongue detect chemical tastants (e.g., salty, sweet, umami), making this a chemically based system.  
- **II. Auditory system**: Incorrect. Hearing relies on mechanical vibration of the basilar membrane in the cochlea, converted into electrical signals via hair cells. No direct chemical interaction is involved.  
- **III. Olfactory system**: Correct. Odorant molecules bind to G-protein-coupled receptors in the nasal epithelium, a classic example of a chemosensory system.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 4**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which sensory systems are chemically based. This requires distinguishing between sensory systems that rely on chemical stimuli versus other mechanisms (e.g., mechanical, electromagnetic).  

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Chemically based sensory systems** depend on chemoreceptors to detect specific molecules or chemical compounds.  
  - **Gustatory system (I)**: Taste involves chemoreceptors on the tongue detecting dissolved chemicals in food.  
  - **Olfactory system (III)**: Smell relies on chemoreceptors in the nasal epithelium detecting airborne chemical molecules.  
- **Non-chemical systems**:  
  - **Auditory system (II)**: Hearing is mechanoreceptor-based, detecting sound waves through mechanical vibrations in the cochlea.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option I (Gustatory)**: Correct. Taste is mediated by chemical interactions.  
- **Option II (Auditory)**: Incorrect. Auditory processing is mechanical, not chemical.  
- **Option III (Olfactory)**: Correct. Smell directly detects chemical molecules in the air.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The chemically based systems are **I (Gustatory)** and **III (Olfactory)**. Neither the auditory system nor any other non-chemical systems apply.  

**My final selection is: Option 4**
