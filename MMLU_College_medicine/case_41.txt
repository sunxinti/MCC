**1. Question Analysis**
- The question is assessing the understanding of ATP production through substrate-level phosphorylation during glycolysis, specifically comparing the net ATP yield from glucose metabolism versus glycogen metabolism.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**
- **Glycolysis Overview**: Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts glucose into pyruvate, generating ATP and NADH in the process.
- **Substrate-Level Phosphorylation**: This is a direct method of generating ATP by transferring a phosphate group from a substrate to ADP.
- **Net ATP Production from Glucose**:
  - **Investment Phase**: 2 ATP molecules are consumed to phosphorylate glucose.
  - **Payoff Phase**: 4 ATP molecules are produced.
  - **Net Gain**: 4 ATP produced - 2 ATP consumed = **2 net ATP molecules**.
- **Glycogen Metabolism**:
  - **Glycogen Breakdown**: Glycogen is broken down into glucose-1-phosphate, which is then converted to glucose-6-phosphate, entering glycolysis.
  - **Net ATP Production**: Each glycogen unit can potentially yield an additional ATP molecule compared to glucose metabolism because the formation of glucose-6-phosphate from glucose-1-phosphate bypasses the first ATP-consuming step of glycolysis. Therefore, the net gain is typically **3 ATP molecules** from glycogen.

**3. Analysis of Options**

- **Option 1. 2 from glucose and 3 from glycogen.**
  - **Analysis**: Aligns with the standard net ATP yields for glycolysis from glucose (2 ATP) and glycogen (3 ATP).
  - **Conclusion**: Correct.

- **Option 2. 2 from glucose and 4 from glycogen.**
  - **Analysis**: Overestimates the net ATP from glycogen; standard yield is 3 ATP.
  - **Conclusion**: Incorrect.

- **Option 3. 3 from glucose and 4 from glycogen.**
  - **Analysis**: Incorrect net ATP for glucose; it should be 2 ATP.
  - **Conclusion**: Incorrect.

- **Option 4. 3 from glucose and 2 from glycogen.**
  - **Analysis**: Incorrect net ATP for both glucose and glycogen.
  - **Conclusion**: Incorrect.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks for the net ATP production via substrate-level phosphorylation specifically during glycolysis when starting with glucose versus glycogen. It requires understanding the differences in ATP yield between the two substrates due to variations in their initial metabolic pathways.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Glycolysis Basics**: Glycolysis breaks glucose into pyruvate, producing ATP through substrate-level phosphorylation.  
- **ATP Production Steps**: Substrate-level phosphorylation occurs at two steps in glycolysis:  
  - Phosphoglycerate kinase converts 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to 3-phosphoglycerate, generating **2 ATP** per glucose.  
  - Pyruvate kinase converts phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate, generating **2 ATP** per glucose.  
  Total ATP produced via substrate-level phosphorylation: **4 ATP per glucose**.  
- **ATP Consumption in Glycolysis**:  
  - Glucose: Two ATP are consumed in the early steps (hexokinase and phosphofructokinase).  
  - Glycogen: The first phosphorylation (hexokinase step) is bypassed because glycogen breakdown yields glucose-1-phosphate, which is converted to glucose-6-phosphate without ATP expenditure. Only **1 ATP** is consumed (phosphofructokinase step).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (2 from glucose and 3 from glycogen)**:  
  - Glucose: The total substrate-level ATP produced is 4, but 2 ATP were consumed in glycolysis. The net ATP gain for glycolysis is **2**, which aligns with standard knowledge.  
  - Glycogen: Since 1 ATP is saved (no hexokinase step), the net ATP gain from glycolysis becomes **4 (produced) – 1 (consumed) = 3**. This matches the option.  
- **Option 2 (2 from glucose and 4 from glycogen)**:  
  - Incorrect because the substrate-level phosphorylation steps in glycolysis always produce 4 ATP, regardless of the starting substrate. The glycogen pathway does not generate an extra ATP here.  
- **Option 3 (3 from glucose and 4 from glycogen)**:  
  - Incorrect because the net ATP from glucose via glycolysis is 2, not 3.  
- **Option 4 (3 from glucose and 2 from glycogen)**:  
  - Incorrect because it reverses the correct values.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The net ATP production via substrate-level phosphorylation in glycolysis is **2 for glucose** (4 produced minus 2 consumed) and **3 for glycogen** (4 produced minus 1 consumed).  

**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks about the net ATP production via substrate-level phosphorylation in glycolysis when starting from glucose versus glycogen. It requires understanding glycolysis steps, ATP consumption/production, and differences when glucose is derived from glycogen.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Glycolysis Steps**:  
  1. **Investment Phase**: 2 ATP consumed (glucose → fructose-1,6-bisphosphate).  
  2. **Payoff Phase**: 4 ATP produced via substrate-level phosphorylation (two steps: 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate → 3-phosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate → pyruvate).  
- **Starting from Glycogen**: Glycogenolysis bypasses the hexokinase step, saving 1 ATP (glucose-1-phosphate → glucose-6-phosphate directly). Thus, only 1 ATP is consumed (phosphofructokinase step), not 2.  
- **Net ATP**:  
  - **Glucose**: 4 ATP (produced) - 2 ATP (used) = **2 net ATP**.  
  - **Glycogen**: 4 ATP (produced) - 1 ATP (used) = **3 net ATP**.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (2 from glucose, 3 from glycogen)**: Matches calculations. Correct.  
- **Option 2 (2 from glucose, 4 from glycogen)**: Incorrect. Glycogen saves 1 ATP but does not increase total substrate-level ATP (still 4 produced).  
- **Option 3 (3 from glucose, 4 from glycogen)**: Incorrect. Glucose cannot yield 3 net ATP.  
- **Option 4 (3 from glucose, 2 from glycogen)**: Incorrect. Reversed values.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**  
The net ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation is **2 for glucose** (4 produced - 2 used) and **3 for glycogen** (4 produced - 1 used). This aligns with glycolysis biochemistry and glycogenolysis efficiency.
