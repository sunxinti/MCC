**1. Question Analysis**
- The question is assessing the understanding of the permeability characteristics of the descending loop of Henle within the nephron of the kidney. It specifically asks which substance among the given options can permeate the descending limb.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**
- The nephron is the functional unit of the kidney, consisting of several parts including the loop of Henle, which has descending and ascending limbs.
- The descending limb of the loop of Henle is primarily permeable to water (H₂O) but impermeable to ions such as sodium (Na⁺), potassium (K⁺), and chloride (Cl⁻).
- This selective permeability is crucial for the concentration of urine and the reabsorption of water from the filtrate.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Na⁺**: Incorrect. The descending limb is impermeable to sodium ions. Sodium reabsorption primarily occurs in the ascending limb.
2. **H₂O**: Correct. The descending limb is highly permeable to water, allowing for significant water reabsorption.
3. **K⁺**: Incorrect. Potassium ions do not permeate the descending limb.
4. **Cl⁻**: Incorrect. Chloride ions are not permeable in the descending limb and are reabsorbed in the ascending limb.

**4. Final Selection**
My final selection is: Option 2

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which substance the descending loop of Henle is permeable to. This requires knowledge of nephron structure, specifically the permeability characteristics of the descending limb in the context of urine concentration and the countercurrent multiplier system.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- The **descending loop of Henle** is primarily involved in water reabsorption due to its high permeability to water.  
- It is **impermeable to sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl–)** but contains aquaporins (water channels) that allow passive water movement.  
- The high osmotic gradient in the medulla surrounding the descending limb drives water reabsorption via osmosis.  
- Potassium (K+) is not a major solute transported in this segment.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Na+):** Incorrect. The descending loop is **impermeable to Na+**. Na+ is actively transported out of the **ascending limb**, not the descending limb.  
- **Option 2 (H₂O):** Correct. The descending loop is highly permeable to water due to aquaporins, allowing water to leave the tubular fluid and enter the hypertonic medullary interstitium.  
- **Option 3 (K+):** Incorrect. Potassium is not a significant solute transported in the descending loop. Its permeability to K+ is negligible.  
- **Option 4 (Cl–):** Incorrect. The descending loop is **impermeable to Cl–**. Like Na+, Cl– is actively transported out of the **ascending limb**, not the descending limb.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which substance the descending loop of Henle is permeable to, focusing on understanding the functional anatomy of the nephron and its role in urine concentration.  

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- The **descending loop of Henle** is part of the countercurrent multiplier system, critical for establishing the medullary osmotic gradient.  
- **Permeability properties**:  
  - **Descending limb**: Permeable to **water** (via aquaporin-1 channels) but **not to ions** (e.g., Na⁺, Cl⁻, K⁺). Water exits passively due to the hypertonic medullary interstitium, concentrating the tubular fluid.  
  - **Ascending limb**: Impermeable to water but actively transports Na⁺, Cl⁻, and K⁺ (via Na⁺-K⁺-2Cl⁻ cotransporters in the thick ascending limb).  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Na⁺)**: Incorrect. Na⁺ reabsorption occurs primarily in the ascending limb, not the descending limb, which lacks ion transporters.  
- **Option 2 (H₂O)**: Correct. The descending limb is highly permeable to water, facilitating passive water reabsorption.  
- **Option 3 (K⁺)**: Incorrect. K⁺ transport occurs in the ascending limb and collecting duct, not the descending limb.  
- **Option 4 (Cl⁻)**: Incorrect. Cl⁻ is cotransported with Na⁺ and K⁺ in the ascending limb, not the descending limb.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The descending loop of Henle’s permeability to **water** (H₂O) is essential for concentrating urine, while its impermeability to ions distinguishes its role from the ascending limb.  

**My final selection is: Option 2**
