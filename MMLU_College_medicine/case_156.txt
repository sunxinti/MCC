**1. Question Analysis**
- The question is asking for the correct term used to describe the coding sequences within genes. Specifically, it seeks to identify which of the provided options accurately names the regions of DNA that are transcribed and translated into proteins.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**
- **Gene Structure:** Genes are composed of coding and non-coding regions. The coding regions are essential for protein synthesis, while non-coding regions have regulatory or structural roles.
- **Exons and Introns:** Exons are the segments of a gene that remain in the mature messenger RNA (mRNA) after splicing and are translated into proteins. Introns, on the other hand, are non-coding regions that are removed during RNA processing.
- **Codons:** Codons are sequences of three nucleotides in mRNA that specify which amino acid will be added next during protein synthesis.
- **Terminology Accuracy:** It is crucial to use the correct scientific terms to avoid confusion, especially when similar-sounding terms are present.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **extrons**
   - **Evaluation:** "Extrons" is not a recognized term in molecular biology. It appears to be a typographical error or a misnomer.
   - **Conclusion:** Incorrect.

2. **exons**
   - **Evaluation:** Exons are indeed the coding sequences of genes. They are transcribed into mRNA and translated into proteins after the introns are removed during RNA splicing.
   - **Conclusion:** Correct.

3. **introns**
   - **Evaluation:** Introns are non-coding regions within a gene that are removed during the processing of pre-mRNA. They do not code for proteins.
   - **Conclusion:** Incorrect.

4. **codons**
   - **Evaluation:** Codons are sequences of three nucleotides in mRNA that correspond to specific amino acids or stop signals during protein synthesis. While they are part of the coding process, they are not themselves the coding sequences of genes.
   - **Conclusion:** Incorrect.

**4. Final Selection**
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks for the term that describes the coding sequences of genes. This relates to the structure of genes and their functional components in molecular biology.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Gene Structure**: Genes consist of **exons** and **introns**. Exons are the nucleotide sequences that code for proteins (coding regions), while introns are non-coding regions removed during RNA splicing.  
- **Codons**: These are triplets of nucleotides in mRNA that specify amino acids, but they are part of the exons, not the structural designation of the gene itself.  
- **Terminology Clarification**: "Extrons" is not a standard term in genetics, likely a distractor.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (extrons)**: Incorrect. This term is not recognized in genetics. The correct term for coding regions is "exons," not "extrons."  
- **Option 2 (exons)**: Correct. Exons are the coding sequences of genes that remain in the mature mRNA after splicing and are translated into proteins.  
- **Option 3 (introns)**: Incorrect. Introns are non-coding regions of genes that are removed during RNA processing and do not contribute to the final protein product.  
- **Option 4 (codons)**: Incorrect. Codons are three-nucleotide sequences within exons that specify amino acids, but they do not refer to the structural components (exons) of the gene itself.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  

Exons are the correct answer because they represent the coding regions of genes that are transcribed into mRNA and subsequently translated into proteins. Introns are non-coding, codons are subsets of the exon sequences, and "extrons" is not a valid term.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks for the term used to describe the coding sequences within genes. This requires understanding gene structure and the terminology associated with DNA transcription and RNA processing.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- Genes consist of coding and non-coding regions. During transcription, both regions are initially transcribed into precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA). 
- **Exons**: Coding sequences that are retained in mature mRNA after splicing and are translated into proteins.  
- **Introns**: Non-coding sequences that are removed during RNA splicing.  
- **Codons**: Triplets of nucleotides in mRNA that specify amino acids during translation.  
- "Extrons" is not a recognized term in genetics.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (extrons)**: Incorrect. "Extrons" is not a valid term in genetic nomenclature. Likely a distractor or misspelling.  
- **Option 2 (exons)**: Correct. Exons are the coding sequences retained in mature mRNA and translated into proteins.  
- **Option 3 (introns)**: Incorrect. Introns are non-coding sequences spliced out during RNA processing.  
- **Option 4 (codons)**: Incorrect. Codons refer to nucleotide triplets in mRNA, not the structural regions of genes.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The coding sequences of genes are termed **exons**, as they are expressed in the final mRNA product and directly contribute to protein synthesis.  

**My final selection is: Option 2**
