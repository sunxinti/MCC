**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is asking which embryonic germ layer is responsible for the development of the lining (epithelium) of both the digestive and respiratory tracts.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Germ Layers:** In embryology, three primary germ layers give rise to different tissues and organs:
  - **Endoderm:** Forms the epithelial lining of the internal organs, including the digestive tract, respiratory tract, and associated glands.
  - **Mesoderm:** Develops into muscles, bones, the circulatory system, and connective tissues.
  - **Ectoderm:** Gives rise to the nervous system, skin, and its derivatives.
- **Development of Lining:** The epithelial lining of both the digestive and respiratory systems originates from the endoderm layer.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **I only (Endoderm)**  
   - **Correct.** The endoderm is solely responsible for the lining of the digestive and respiratory tracts.
2. **II only (Mesoderm)**  
   - **Incorrect.** The mesoderm does not contribute to the epithelial lining of these tracts.
3. **III only (Ectoderm)**  
   - **Incorrect.** The ectoderm is unrelated to the lining of the digestive and respiratory systems.
4. **I and II (Endoderm and Mesoderm)**  
   - **Incorrect.** Only the endoderm is involved in forming the linings; the mesoderm does not contribute to this specific structure.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks about the embryonic germ layers responsible for the development of the linings of the digestive and respiratory tracts. It requires knowledge of embryology, specifically the fate of the three primary germ layers (endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm).

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Endoderm**: Forms the epithelial lining of the digestive tract (from the pharynx to the anal canal), respiratory tract (trachea, bronchi, and lungs), and associated glands (e.g., liver, pancreas).  
- **Mesoderm**: Gives rise to muscles, connective tissues, blood vessels, and the urogenital system. It contributes to the muscular layers of the digestive tract but not the epithelial lining.  
- **Ectoderm**: Develops into the skin, nervous system, and structures like the enamel of teeth. It does not contribute to the internal linings of the digestive or respiratory tracts.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (I only)**: Correct. The epithelial linings of both the digestive and respiratory tracts originate from the endoderm.  
- **Option 2 (II only)**: Incorrect. Mesoderm contributes to the muscular and connective tissue layers but not the epithelial lining of these tracts.  
- **Option 3 (III only)**: Incorrect. Ectoderm is unrelated to the internal linings of these tracts.  
- **Option 4 (I and II)**: Incorrect. While mesoderm contributes to structural support, it does not form the epithelial lining.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 1**

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks which germ layer(s) give rise to the lining of the digestive and respiratory tracts. It requires understanding embryonic development, specifically the differentiation of germ layers (endoderm, mesoderm, ectoderm) into specific tissues and organs.  

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Endoderm**: Forms the epithelial lining of the gastrointestinal tract (including the stomach, intestines) and respiratory tract (trachea, bronchi, lungs). It also gives rise to associated glands (e.g., liver, pancreas).  
- **Mesoderm**: Develops into connective tissues, muscles, blood vessels, and serous membranes surrounding organs (e.g., smooth muscle layers of the gut wall).  
- **Ectoderm**: Forms the epidermis, nervous system, and epithelial linings of structures like the mouth and anus (proctodeum and stomodeum), but these are exceptions at the terminal ends of the digestive tract.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (I only)**: Correct. The **endoderm** forms the epithelial lining of both the digestive tract (except the mouth and anus, which are ectodermal) and the entire respiratory tract. The question specifies the "lining," which primarily refers to the mucosal epithelium derived from endoderm.  
- **Option 2 (II only)**: Incorrect. Mesoderm contributes to supportive structures (e.g., muscle, connective tissue) but not the epithelial lining.  
- **Option 3 (III only)**: Incorrect. Ectoderm forms the epidermis and nervous system, but only the extreme ends of the digestive tract (mouth and anus) are ectodermal.  
- **Option 4 (I and II)**: Incorrect. While mesoderm supports the tracts structurally, it does not contribute to their epithelial lining.  

**4. Final Selection**  
- The digestive and respiratory tract linings are predominantly endodermal in origin. Mesoderm and ectoderm play no role in forming their epithelial linings, except at the terminal ends (mouth/anus), which are not the focus here.  

**My final selection is: Option 1**
