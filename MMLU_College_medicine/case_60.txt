================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**
- The question is asking about the determinants of metabolism. Specifically, it seeks to identify the primary factor that influences metabolic processes within cells.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**
- **Metabolism** encompasses all biochemical reactions occurring within living organisms, including both catabolic and anabolic pathways.
- **Enzymes**, which are proteins, play a crucial role in catalyzing these metabolic reactions.
- The **genetic material (DNA)** dictates the synthesis of specific proteins (enzymes) through the processes of transcription and translation.
- The availability of substrates (e.g., amino acids) is also important, but it is a downstream effect of enzyme presence and activity.
- **Ribonucleic acids (RNAs)** are involved in the protein synthesis process but do not directly determine metabolic pathways based on their amino acid composition.

**3. Analysis of Options**
1. **Size of proteins in the cell.**
   - Incorrect. The size of proteins does not directly determine metabolic activity. It is the specific type and function of the proteins (enzymes) that matter.
2. **Availability of amino acids.**
   - Partially correct. While the availability of amino acids is important for protein synthesis, it is not the primary determinant of metabolism.
3. **Proteins formed as dictated by the genetic material.**
   - Correct. The genetic material encodes for specific proteins (enzymes) that regulate and determine metabolic pathways.
4. **Amino acid composition of the ribonucleic acids.**
   - Incorrect. RNAs are composed of nucleotides, not amino acids. This option misrepresents the structure of RNA and its role in metabolism.

**4. Final Selection**

**My final selection is: Option 3**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks about the primary determinant of metabolism. Metabolism encompasses all chemical reactions in an organism, including anabolism (building molecules) and catabolism (breaking down molecules). The answer must identify the factor that directly dictates these metabolic processes.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Metabolism and Enzymes**: Metabolic reactions are catalyzed by enzymes, which are proteins. The presence and activity of these enzymes determine the rate and direction of metabolic pathways.  
- **Genetic Control**: Enzymes are synthesized based on genetic instructions encoded in DNA. The genetic material dictates which proteins (including enzymes) are produced.  
- **Proteins and Function**: Proteins (enzymes) are responsible for executing metabolic reactions. Their structure and function are determined by the genetic code.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: Size of proteins in the cell**  
  Incorrect. Protein size alone does not determine metabolism. While protein structure is important, metabolism depends on the specific enzymes (proteins) present and their functions, not their physical size.  

- **Option 2: Availability of amino acids**  
  Incorrect. Amino acids are substrates for protein synthesis, but their availability affects protein production rather than directly determining metabolism. Even with sufficient amino acids, the specific enzymes required for metabolism must first be encoded by the genetic material.  

- **Option 3: Proteins formed as dictated by the genetic material**  
  Correct. The genetic material (DNA) encodes the instructions for synthesizing proteins, including enzymes that catalyze metabolic reactions. The specific proteins produced (based on genetic code) directly determine metabolic pathways and their activity.  

- **Option 4: Amino acid composition of the ribonucleic acids (RNA)**  
  Incorrect. RNA (ribonucleic acid) is composed of nucleotides, not amino acids. This option is scientifically inaccurate, as amino acids are components of proteins, not RNA.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 3**  

The genetic material (DNA) dictates the synthesis of specific proteins, including enzymes that drive metabolic reactions. Without the correct proteins (enzymes) formed from genetic instructions, metabolism cannot proceed as determined. This makes Option 3 the only accurate answer.

================================================================================
**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question asks for the primary determinant of metabolism. Metabolism encompasses all biochemical reactions in cells, driven by enzymes (proteins). The focus is on identifying the fundamental factor that dictates these processes.  

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Enzymes and Metabolism**: Enzymes catalyze metabolic reactions. Their presence and activity determine the rate and pathways of metabolism.  
- **Genetic Control of Protein Synthesis**: DNA (genetic material) contains the instructions for synthesizing proteins, including enzymes. Gene expression dictates which proteins/enzymes are produced, thereby defining metabolic capabilities.  
- **Amino Acid Availability**: While amino acids are required for protein synthesis, their availability does not inherently determine which proteins are made; this is governed by genetic regulation.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Size of proteins)**: Incorrect. Protein size does not determine metabolic function; enzymatic activity depends on structure and active sites, not size alone.  
- **Option 2 (Availability of amino acids)**: Incorrect. Amino acids are necessary for protein synthesis, but their availability does not dictate which proteins (enzymes) are formed—genetic material does.  
- **Option 3 (Proteins formed as dictated by genetic material)**: Correct. DNA encodes the sequence of all proteins, including metabolic enzymes. Without specific enzymes, corresponding metabolic pathways cannot occur.  
- **Option 4 (Amino acid composition of RNA)**: Incorrect. RNA does not determine protein composition; it serves as an intermediary (mRNA) for translating genetic information from DNA into proteins.  

**4. Final Selection**  
The most accurate answer is **Option 3**, as genetic material (DNA) directly determines which enzymes/proteins are synthesized, thereby governing metabolic processes. While other factors (e.g., amino acid availability) influence protein production, the genetic code is the foundational determinant.  

**My final selection is: Option 3**
