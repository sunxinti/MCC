**1. Question Analysis**  
- The question is asking which substance releases the most energy when it is completely oxidized in the body. This involves understanding the energy yield of different macronutrients upon metabolism.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Energy Yield of Macronutrients:** 
  - **Carbohydrates (e.g., glucose):** Approximately 4 kcal per gram.
  - **Fats (e.g., palmitic acid):** Approximately 9 kcal per gram.
  - **Proteins (e.g., leucine):** Approximately 4 kcal per gram.
  - **Alcohol (ethanol):** Approximately 7 kcal per gram.
- **Oxidation Process:** Complete oxidation refers to the metabolic pathways that fully break down these molecules to carbon dioxide and water, releasing energy stored in their chemical bonds.

**3. Analysis of Options**  
1. **One gram of glucose**
   - **Energy Yield:** ~4 kcal/g.
   - **Evaluation:** Lower energy yield compared to fats and alcohol.
2. **One gram of palmitic acid**
   - **Energy Yield:** ~9 kcal/g.
   - **Evaluation:** Highest energy yield among the options provided.
3. **One gram of leucine**
   - **Energy Yield:** ~4 kcal/g.
   - **Evaluation:** Similar to glucose, lower energy yield.
4. **One gram of alcohol**
   - **Energy Yield:** ~7 kcal/g.
   - **Evaluation:** Higher than glucose and leucine but lower than palmitic acid.

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which substance releases the most energy when completely oxidized in the body. It requires knowledge of the caloric content and energy yield of different macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, fats) and alcohol. The key concept is understanding the energy density (kcal/g) and biochemical oxidation processes of each option.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- **Energy Content by Macronutrient**:  
  - Carbohydrates (e.g., glucose) and proteins (e.g., leucine) provide **~4 kcal/g**.  
  - Fats (e.g., palmitic acid) provide **~9 kcal/g** due to their high hydrogen content and efficient oxidation.  
  - Alcohol provides **~7 kcal/g**, but its oxidation prioritizes over other fuels and is less efficient.  

- **Complete Oxidation**:  
  - Complete oxidation refers to the full breakdown of a molecule into CO₂ and H₂O via glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation (for carbohydrates/proteins) or beta-oxidation followed by the same pathways (for fats).  
  - Fats yield more energy because their molecular structure is more reduced (rich in C-H bonds), requiring more oxygen for complete oxidation.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1: One gram of glucose**  
  - Carbohydrate with **4 kcal/g**. While glucose is a primary energy source, its caloric density is lower than fats.  
  - **Incorrect** due to lower energy yield compared to fats.  

- **Option 2: One gram of palmitic acid**  
  - Saturated fatty acid (16 carbons). Fats have the highest caloric density (**9 kcal/g**) due to their high hydrogen content.  
  - Complete oxidation releases significantly more energy than carbohydrates, proteins, or alcohol.  
  - **Correct** as it provides the most energy per gram.  

- **Option 3: One gram of leucine**  
  - Branched-chain amino acid (protein). Yields **4 kcal/g**, same as glucose.  
  - **Incorrect** due to lower energy yield compared to fats.  

- **Option 4: One gram of alcohol**  
  - Provides **7 kcal/g**, but its incomplete oxidation (e.g., via alcohol dehydrogenase) generates acetaldehyde and acetate, which enter the Krebs cycle.  
  - While higher than carbs/proteins, it still yields less than fats.  
  - **Incorrect** compared to palmitic acid.  

**4. Final Selection**  
**My final selection is: Option 2**  

Palmitic acid, a fatty acid, releases the most energy per gram due to its high caloric density (9 kcal/g) compared to glucose (4 kcal/g), leucine (4 kcal/g), and alcohol (7 kcal/g). Fats have more reduced carbon chains, allowing for greater ATP production during complete oxidation through beta-oxidation and the electron transport chain.

**1. Question Analysis**  
The question asks which substance releases the most energy per gram when fully oxidized in the body. This requires understanding the energy density (caloric value) of different macronutrients and compounds during metabolism.

**2. Key Medical Considerations**  
- Energy yield is determined by the caloric content per gram:  
  - **Carbohydrates (e.g., glucose):** ~4 kcal/g.  
  - **Proteins (e.g., leucine):** ~4 kcal/g (slightly less due to energy lost in nitrogen excretion).  
  - **Fats (e.g., palmitic acid):** ~9 kcal/g (highest energy density due to high hydrogen-carbon bonds).  
  - **Alcohol:** ~7 kcal/g.  
- Complete oxidation refers to metabolic breakdown into CO₂ and H₂O, maximizing ATP production.  

**3. Analysis of Options**  
- **Option 1 (Glucose):** At ~4 kcal/g, it has the lowest energy density among the options.  
- **Option 2 (Palmitic acid):** As a long-chain fatty acid, it provides ~9 kcal/g, the highest caloric value.  
- **Option 3 (Leucine):** Though a branched-chain amino acid, protein oxidation yields ~4 kcal/g, similar to carbohydrates.  
- **Option 4 (Alcohol):** Provides ~7 kcal/g, intermediate between fats and carbohydrates.  

**4. Final Selection**  
Palmitic acid (Option 2) releases the most energy per gram due to its high caloric density from fatty acid oxidation.  

**My final selection is: Option 2**
